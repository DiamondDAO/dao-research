It is a proof-of-concept to empower users with the freedom to get boldly creative with their own NFT projects, thereby throwing open the floodgates to a cosmos of possibilities within the web3 ecosystem.\n\nSee the [scope section] for a general overview of work contributed thus far or [skip to the Rationale section to learn a little more about \nmy background].\n\n*Note: I understand this is a special case discussed with some team members; in the future, I will be making proposals ahead of time to avoid retroactive payments.\n\n### Future Contribution (HyperVIBES & Other Projects)\nThis section is purely for full disclosure and transparency to the R group and the DAO.\n\nThough this specific proposal is only for retroactive payment for phase I of HyperVIBES, it also potentially signals continuing contribution towards the success of HyperVIBES and other projects within the R Group.\n\nAfter this proposal, there will no further cases of retro payment,; Moving forward, my future contribution will require approval ahead of time\u2014\n\nIf I choose to continue to contribute on a per-project (part-time) basis, I will write a new proposal per these standard guidelines: [R Group Basics]\nIf the R Group realizes the absolute need to transition my contribution to full-time, I will write another proposal to kick off as a prospective member (via 2-month trial) per these standard guidelines: [R Group Basics]\n### Scope & Contributions to HyperVIBES Phase I\nAs the sole designer of HyperVIBES, I wore many hats that would traditionally be assigned to respective designers (Brand & Visual, Product, UI/UX, Motion/Animation, Creative Direction)\n\nAt a high-level, Phase I, the MVP, was realized and executed in the same way I would any other design deliverable through these three exercises:\n\n- Discovery and Research\n- Conceptual Design\n- Detailed/Finalised Design\n\nVisual communication and brand experience\n- Defining the visual language, look and feel\n  - A solid week of explorations and multiple design directions to speak to a fresh perspective and narrative\u2014Rejecting the tired clich\u00e9 of Space, embracing the escher-like romance of discovering interdimensional unknowns\n  - Logo & Logotype explorations\n  - Type Treatment\n  - Color Palette\n  - 3D & 2D Artwork and animation\n\nLanding Page/Website (Pre and Post App Launch)\n- Create an immersive, light yet digestible landing page to direct traffic to the HyperVIBES App\n- Interaction & Motion Design\n- Icons & Visuals\n- Coordination with front-end/full-stack engineer Zak to build and illiterate\n- Provide input on concise, engaging, yet comprehensible language/content strategy\n\nHyperVibes Web App - MVP\n- Using Zak\u2019s initial wireframes as a guiding light for a focused MVP, create a ux-friendly experience to accommodate these actions\n- Entering the experience and choosing their path\n- Create Realms\n- Infuse tokens\n- Claim tokens\n- Browse/Explore\n- Basic sharing\n- Viewing existing realms and NFTs within each realm\n- Define engaging experience w/o taking away from the utility\n- Error States\n- Confirmation\n\nMisc\n- Marketing content & assets\n- Note that not all work/designs was executed for this Phase I due to team bandwidth and the need to keep scope focused as an MVP.\n\n### Proposed Compensation\nThe following numbers are reasonable and conservative based on two considerations\u2014\n\nMarket-competitive flat rate based on a multi-layered scope, expedited turnaround and 8+ years of experience in multiple design touchpoints\nReferences/Literature:\n\nStart-up Branding - see link in google doc\n\nUI/UX Cost - see link in google doc\n\nWebsite Design Cost - see link in google doc\n\nCalibre and delivery of Phase I MVP\u2014the expedited work for a fairly polished proof-of-concept was comparable to that of a lead product designer - (see link in google doc)\n\nScope (Market-Base)\tPhase I (~4 weeks;
