This post follows the new pattern we\u2019re trying out in the dev working group (see Brandon\u2019s post [here](https://gov.rarible.org/t/dev-wg-brandon-2-month-trial-period/237)).\n\nThis proposal is for kicking off my 2-month trial period as a full-time contributor for the Dev WG (also known as R Group).\n\nCheck out this doc for why we\u2019re starting with 2 month trials and other context:\n- [R Group Structure, Goals, & Processes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TxkoelIV7HV5kV6yn30id6EY3hv7i-j-JvJ-HvNxeB4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nDoc covering my background, how I expect to contribute, and my proposed compensation:\n- [Ezra - Contributor Sheet 4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fMWRjbwNDYDcio-HtekTohPxi0cGt-883j_w55HmfsU/edit#heading=h.h321rnwh3j3s)\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve been responsible for much of the internal organization of the dev working group (e.g. suggesting this process, facilitating meetings, etc. \u2013 here\u2019s 1 another doc that shows some of the thinking we\u2019ve been doing). Over the next week or so I\u2019ll continue to get the group organized and hope to be able to present 2-3 projects currently being working by members to the DAO in a clear way.\n\nHappy to field any questions, comments, and ideas in the forum thread [here](https://gov.rarible.org/t/dev-wg-ezra-2-month-trial-period/239).", "choices": ["Yes!", "No!"], "start": 1634598000, "end": 1634770800, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [1, 0], "scores_total": 1, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1636759255, "snapshot": "20359775", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4171160dB0e7E2C75A4973b7523B437C010Dd9d4", "space": {"id": "r-group.eth", "name": "R Group"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSTMkpY6YdUbvYApeMbqsfxzn471aTJ8UhPDwcjZemzHE", "voter": "0x4DAAc1943c42B5988629414af1c32936601E81ea", "created": 1634600749, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "r-group.eth"}}]}
