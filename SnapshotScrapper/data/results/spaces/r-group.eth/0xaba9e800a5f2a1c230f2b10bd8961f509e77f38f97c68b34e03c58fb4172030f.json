The fees these days with the high network usage and the scaling solutions being a \u201ca work in progress\u201d can be substantial.\n\nThis can be a discouraging fact for the creators who may get second thoughts about creating NFTs who may not sell eventually and investing a bunch of money for something uncertain.\n\nThis brings up the questions, why and how to create an item without paying for the network fee at the time of the mint.\n\nThis problem is solved by introducing lazy minting that provides a way for a creator to create the NFT without paying for the transaction execution. The transaction is being executed at the moment when another user decides to buy or claim the NFT.\n\n### My contributions\n\nDesigned the UI/UX of MagicMint marketing site: I worked alongside Stefan to create the lazy-mint and claim page for users to interact with the flow of the marketing page and to give it a high quality.\nDesigned MagicMint application interface: I also designed the application interface for users to create and mint their NFTs to their specific addresses.\n\nProposed compensation\n- Magicmint Marketing Site: $500\n- Magicmint Application: $500\n\nTotal: $1000\n\nThis is the proposal for the first compensation of my contribution.\n\nTotal Compensation asked: $1000 paid in ETH.\n\nAddress: 0x352ca2026033eA95EBcd198D5F922184820D514F", "choices": ["Yay", "Nay", "Abstain"], "start": 1638810000, "end": 1639155600, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [4, 0, 0], "scores_total": 4, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1639155622, "snapshot": "22204975", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4171160dB0e7E2C75A4973b7523B437C010Dd9d4", "space": {"id": "r-group.eth", "name": "R Group"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x8e9b95d0ef87b67baf6678859939eb60a9ca5b8c4cafb3675d6a2ca18f3f0c66", "voter": "0x559441FEf78b7E27b66db69C11e5B3827e1aea96", "created": 1639048231, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "r-group.eth"}}, {"id": "0x5bf400e9d2baf3ade15bbe8dd006fe3f9444d026b4293c94c1eab78fcddb8b2c", "voter": "0x8AbAf5733742B1506F6a1255de0e37aEc76b7940", "created": 1638901647, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "r-group.eth"}}, {"id": "0x9e00886e0a5d315417617f1f1c5b5961dc5d507851d48e7f25f16a2d93541474", "voter": "0x4171160dB0e7E2C75A4973b7523B437C010Dd9d4", "created": 1638819408, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "r-group.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVZcWKHMzTk4EZK9Qq4JGoJWpJnMPXQJNRuYcHiDAbxWN", "voter": "0x303EeFeDeE1bA8e5d507a55465d946B2fea18583", "created": 1638811201, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "r-group.eth"}}]}
