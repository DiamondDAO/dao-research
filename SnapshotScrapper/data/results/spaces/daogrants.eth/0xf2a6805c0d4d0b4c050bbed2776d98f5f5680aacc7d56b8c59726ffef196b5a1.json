This Explorer will be displaying the data and analytics on any NFTs that are created on blockchains that are integrated with the protocol.\n\nProblem / Opportunity\nUsers of the Rarible protocol do not have the opportunity to view data of NFTs created on different blockchains that are integrated with the Rarible protocol.\n\nUse cases:\nOne place to view all NFTs created on various blockchains integrated into the Rarible protocol.\nNFT contract addresses / NFT name\nToken ID (optional)\nSearch for collections by name / address of the contract.\nThe user will be able to view analytics on it for any collection (items, floor prices, owners, volume (daily and etc), today\u2019s sales and etc.) and add useful filters.\nIf a person wants to connect his wallet, he will see his NFT with analytics (items, floor prices, owners, volume (daily and etc.), today\u2019s sales and etc) and can add useful filters.\nIn the future, the functionality will be expanded.", "choices": ["vote FOR", "vote AGAINST", "ABSTAIN"], "start": 1638993600, "end": 1639512000, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 5, 1], "scores_total": 6, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1639512016, "snapshot": "22296742", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa15Ca74e65bf72730811ABF95163E89aD9b9DFF6", "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth", "name": "Grants Working Group"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x3459577d8ca60db644d2dfe87e7d4bf504e131c3b3ff994c0171b0a54c0470fc", "voter": "0xd662fA474C0A1346a26374bb4581D1F6D3Fb2d94", "created": 1639217064, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRLjww8LAGgSDRCz7Vo6KKgQUFEh63aMRm5BbyyDcv2Mr", "voter": "0x215B8974a7209df6368285232acfC6Ba8180bd47", "created": 1639169227, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x54697909fdbbd14cc50aaa1fbf94a50f34169e8d9ff3a6960df4f0461a5ee13a", "voter": "0x173a55e664c25986F7a2495998751A255793D1AB", "created": 1639158092, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x76feeaafed599a6d192bb48d0ef09688208dc6dab99a78a92f93b8dd06f4b957", "voter": "0x4171160dB0e7E2C75A4973b7523B437C010Dd9d4", "created": 1639153344, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe108cf15d723a8943c6d1e8bc7eaa22a36021ab049e38fd70a6275a8a1778af7", "voter": "0x4DAAc1943c42B5988629414af1c32936601E81ea", "created": 1639149826, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x76a9954aad26c970455f0cfacc42caacc153f2fd94360204839e97a79d0859f6", "voter": "0x70b71b98c8b95643462C68e0A396d0a6d15337bf", "created": 1639089655, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}]}
