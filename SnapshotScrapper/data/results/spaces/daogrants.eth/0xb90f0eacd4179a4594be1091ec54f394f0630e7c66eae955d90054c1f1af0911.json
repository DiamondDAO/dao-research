It is completely decentralized, and uses web3 technologies end to end.\n\nYou can create a decentralized profile by connecting your Ethereum or Tezos wallet, and get an onchain website hosted on IPFS. You can use it to showcase your NFTs, your links, and socials, like a Web3 Linktree. You can create a profile at DNS.xyz.\n\nWe believe your should own your profile, and that not one server should control your data. The same 10 websites control 95% of the Internet, so we decided to give everyone a profile that they own. You control it via your wallets, using any blockchain, and it is completely open and portable.\n\nSome of you may know us for the work in helping bring HicEtNunc.xyz back online last week! Currently we have around 10,000 monthly users and 500 artists with profiles. We\u2019ve got a number of well-known creators, such as Pixelord, Flygohr, MonsterRockets. We work closely with the top DID (decentralized identity) platforms: Ceramic, and Spruce Systems. We\u2019re popular with the Tezos community, with regular support from Tezos Commons and creators on HicEtNunc.\n\nProblem / Opportunity\nRaribel DAO users currently do not have a way to show off who they are. There are no profiles pages, no links to visit, nowhere to show the activity from your wallets. We have already started working on making this available for everyone using the Rarible Protocol.\n\nWe already have decentralized profiles, such as https://dns.xyz/oddcr0w 2. They can currently display Tezos NFTs minted on HicEtNunc. With this grant, we want to add support for every chain supported by the Rarible Protocol. You\u2019ll be able to show off every NFT you own on Ethereum, Polygon, Tezos, and Flow.\n\nIn addition, we will introduce discovery features: you will be able to browse for recent, cheap, top selling NFTs across these chains.\n\nMost of this is supported out of the box with the Rarible protocol\u2019s indexers. The majority of the funds would be directed towards frontend work, to integrate with the indexers, create NFT showcases, discovery views, and ensure this works well for content across all chains. With these updates we would be introducing the first social platform to the Rarible DAO. Everyone will have beautiful profile pages and NFT galleries.\n\nFunding Milestones and Payments\nMilestones & payments:\n\nMilestones 1: UI design and mapping architecture\n\nMilestones 2: Implementation of Rarible protocol and frontend development\n\nMilestone 3: Swapping NFTs from previous contracts to new Rarible protocol contracts\n\nTotal payment: $60,000 USD equivalent in RARI ($10K upfront to pay for hiring, $10K upon completion of Milestone 1, $20K upon completion of Milestone 2, and $20K on completion of milestone 3.\n\nTimeline: Depending on integration of Tezos in the works @Rarible, ~ 2 weeks for Milestone 1, 1 month for completion of Milestone 2, and full completion >3 months.\n\nPayments will be made to the following Ethereum address: 0xbF72b541c7750BE800cb92eB460d8e59F4942E72\n\nWe consider ourselves independent contractors of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed.\n\nTeam Members\nShokunin - founder and product manager shokunin@dns.xyz\n\nAnvil - UX designer at DNS.xyz, anvil@dns.xyz\n\nGeo - developer at DNS.xyz, geo@dns.xyz\n\nVaultec - developer at DNS.xyz, vaultec@dns.xyz\n\nShokunin will be the touch-point for the Rarible <> DNS relationship. Shokunin regularly speaks in depth with Rarible DAO lead, Eric Arsenault.\n\nAccountability\nI will attend weekly community calls, and provide updates on milestones as I make progress. I also plan to coordinate with the Rarible development team in regards to the architecture. In the event that we can\u2019t fulfill our commitment, funds will be returned to Rarible DAO.\n\nWhy should Rarible DAO fund this?\nThere are a few reasons:\n\nRarible DAO and DNS share a vision: everyone should be able to freely create, share and distribute content. In order to achieve this, everyone should have a profile page, a username that is free and decentralized. We wish to challenge the current status quo of social platforms that keep your information hostage, and deliver an alternative built on top of the Rarible DAO.\n\nWe do not have any token yet, as our team has been focused on delivering a working product asap. Once we introduce one, we will donate tokens to Rarible DAO at a similar valuation as our current funding round.\n\nWe will open the code for this project, so all protocol or non-protocol members will benefit from our codebase.\n\nUseful Links & Media\nhttps://blog.dns.xyz/a-technical-deep-dive-on-how-hicetnunc-was-recovered/", "choices": ["Approve", "Reject", "Abstain"], "start": 1637820840, "end": 1638568800, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [4, 1, 1], "scores_total": 6, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638568820, "snapshot": "21773711", "state": "closed", "author": "0x173a55e664c25986F7a2495998751A255793D1AB", "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth", "name": "Grants Working Group"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xedaf7de34b468ccc21648f609b5de3d05444ba6ed4e5d6807bf3ba94ed4d17ed", "voter": "0x70b71b98c8b95643462C68e0A396d0a6d15337bf", "created": 1638299576, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0xfab7fae48673925f2c5cc572201181dea6b01abbdef555bf4bcb48541f1d8e11", "voter": "0x4171160dB0e7E2C75A4973b7523B437C010Dd9d4", "created": 1638241064, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRLYEm5NWDWFjYi57fG4UYf8w6km6rKvqcCzshRRquxdU", "voter": "0x215B8974a7209df6368285232acfC6Ba8180bd47", "created": 1638234207, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0xfcedb118379ce684b67d0989a098f7976fc93f783ee42b3c9797ee1c87ef835e", "voter": "0x078eDe7D7174c81D4d3CCA8265f79F464E576013", "created": 1638222771, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x89235fc739c3c8725d676430ff5ed2f241f26756933d29fd71f0d3601a7f5a91", "voter": "0x4DAAc1943c42B5988629414af1c32936601E81ea", "created": 1637961525, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0xebf3e28883ef3ba5c1bc8db3a030a3da3967d1804a30a1d1ccefac9c55714368", "voter": "0x173a55e664c25986F7a2495998751A255793D1AB", "created": 1637951304, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}]}
