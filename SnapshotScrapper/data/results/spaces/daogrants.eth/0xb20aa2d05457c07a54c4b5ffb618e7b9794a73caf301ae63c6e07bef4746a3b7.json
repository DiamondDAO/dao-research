In addition, any user can take their NFT, which has already been created on Rarible, and pack it in a Random Box on OnlineOcean. We will earn extra money for packing items into boxes.\n\nWe want to create a marketplace that will have a simple Random Box toolkit that will work well for both artists and GameFi games. Only Binance NFT has such functionality, but it is closed to everyone, and it\u2019s unlikely that it will be opened.\n\nWe also want to do collaborations with Rarible \u2013 a user will be able to add their NFT located on Rarible to our box and sell it randomly with game mechanics. This will allow artists to sell their work faster and not get lost in a large number of NFTs.\n\nAnother important part of our project will be a section dedicated to in-games items and characters, which also goes very well with the Random Box mechanics.\n\nIn addition to the above, we give the opportunity for any artists regardless of their fame or popularity to post and sell their NFTs directly on OnlineOcean.", "choices": ["Approve", "Reject", "Abstain"], "start": 1637820720, "end": 1638568800, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 2, 4], "scores_total": 6, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638568820, "snapshot": "21773669", "state": "closed", "author": "0x173a55e664c25986F7a2495998751A255793D1AB", "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth", "name": "Grants Working Group"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xdc2369d57cdccb8eb0b8fbdb24f3c425f6070ad88884cedad053bdb0462100eb", "voter": "0x70b71b98c8b95643462C68e0A396d0a6d15337bf", "created": 1638299745, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x3cd0e0d6500a872d42ea166d58d643c563754e01165372dcb55d4271c831e645", "voter": "0x4171160dB0e7E2C75A4973b7523B437C010Dd9d4", "created": 1638240712, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQqMrRgLDdAw3WJm6tkaVdgqSgY1swNvg5pJbvUERdACk", "voter": "0x215B8974a7209df6368285232acfC6Ba8180bd47", "created": 1638234549, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x8806266d75020ee458a198538e5d7b3909c075a93483962239779b96a5557e64", "voter": "0x173a55e664c25986F7a2495998751A255793D1AB", "created": 1638231452, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x9e24dadc0130296892ee3b597e51acab540e22fe13d0f9c19a6311fea5b929d3", "voter": "0x078eDe7D7174c81D4d3CCA8265f79F464E576013", "created": 1638229155, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x90ad0b131ebe902c32bd0eddf774003829aeb0aebcf2d6438f8e5d88b94e46e1", "voter": "0x4DAAc1943c42B5988629414af1c32936601E81ea", "created": 1638198188, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}]}
