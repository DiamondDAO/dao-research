After that recipient could activate the transfer at any time.\n\nThe mechanic provides onboarding to NFT for new audiences who are not familiar with rarible, NFT & defi. Also, rarible could increase current users engagement.\n\nWe have already developed a working prototype during September Definition Hackathon and took a 3d prize in the Rarible track. And for the last month we designed a decentralized (i.e. with trustless) version with a smart contract.\n\nThe Implementation:\n\n0. Backend (Rarible) creates the special contract and posts the one to the EVM.\nThe gift sender creates a random password.\n\nThe gift sender gives to our smart-contract transfer permission & small collateral to cover gas fees on the receiver side (the sender secures the actions with the random password).\n\nThe gift sender notifies the backend (Rarible) about possible transfer & request for random verification code.\n\nFrontend on the sender side generates a link with information about sender, NFT from the verification code and meta provided.\n\nReceiver could use this link and the password to perform the transfer on his frontend side. The backend uses the link to match the receiver, and password verification is used inside our smart contract.\n\nFunding Milestones and Payments\n\nMilestone 1: 1nov \u2192 1dec Development of the mechanic production version(backend + simple frontend). It includes contract development & verification.\n\nUsers will be able to:\n\ncreate a special link to their NFT with possibility to perform suspended transfer via that link.\n\nreceive NFT via our special links even if the receiver does not have ETH address yet.\n\n$3,000 upfront, $2,000 upon completion of the Milestone 1;\n\nMilestone 2: 1 dec \u2192 1 feb Promotions, Partnerships + UI/UX.\n\n$3,000 upfront, $2,000 upon completion of the Milestone 2;\n\nFor now we have agreements about mechanic usage: 1) with small non-profit organisations as an NFT-provider of memorable badges for organisation donors. 2) with a few persons who actually want to make NFT gifts to people who don\u2019t have any experience with it.\n\nDates may be subject to change, but the team will do its utmost to meet the deadlines.\n\nPayments will be made to the following Ethereum address: 0x086B89Fcf9a964055Ba926471f3C2E7AA29D62a5\n\nUse of Funds\n\nThe funds will be used to cover the payments to the team members and the expenses for tools, services and marketing that the team would need during the implementation. We will provide a detailed report on the use of funds upon request.\n\nTeam Members\n\nWe have built a team that worked on gift mechanic during the Definition Hackathons in Rarible track and keep working on the:\n\nBusiness Development / Project Management / Design: Olga Miller Telegram: @o_kad\n\nBlockchain Development: Sergei Miller Telegram: @sergmiller: GitHub: sergmiller\n\nFullstack Development: Ivan Cheprasov Telegram: @AcademyScience GitHub: AlcibiadesCleinias\n\nAccountability\n\nOur team will attend weekly Rarible community calls and provide updates on our milestones as we make progress.\n\nWe will provide updates on our Twitter account (https://twitter.com/whynft7 4) and on https://gov.rarible.org/.\n\nThe source code will be stored in repositories under the NaFThalene GitHub organization\n\nWhy should Rarible DAO fund this?\n\nUsing the NFT gift mechanic will allow:\n\nto solve all the problems listed above\nto onboard on NFT non-crypto users and increase Rarible audience\nto grow current users engagement.", "choices": ["Approve", "Reject", "Abstain"], "start": 1637820300, "end": 1638568800, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [6, 0, 0], "scores_total": 6, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638568819, "snapshot": "21773418", "state": "closed", "author": "0x173a55e664c25986F7a2495998751A255793D1AB", "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth", "name": "Grants Working Group"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x4ae2de57316aa920e335f31d27682d049550a580d2490b290550417892a6d846", "voter": "0x70b71b98c8b95643462C68e0A396d0a6d15337bf", "created": 1638299706, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVHUZp7JM1ZmHAzgFfN4DBJTmbujQsSm2QkZwcc3zkiB4", "voter": "0x215B8974a7209df6368285232acfC6Ba8180bd47", "created": 1638234305, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0e02616a175a38fc3087d79c5638b4bd8779a90f7110ee46be7f8a16ad43b638", "voter": "0x173a55e664c25986F7a2495998751A255793D1AB", "created": 1638231538, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x19a61c13fcaa3547c46e162356a2210123063ae1e7a869fe3d5f986b4b1d0c56", "voter": "0x4171160dB0e7E2C75A4973b7523B437C010Dd9d4", "created": 1638229465, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x88da3fec57cc5a3721de409f031b5e1f6405f3d8a3c611b952026ff72b84bde7", "voter": "0x078eDe7D7174c81D4d3CCA8265f79F464E576013", "created": 1638222899, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc1ed1fb450a2f37bb3f2597518897bf2036d5a617e32e0f365f04e8909da2e7e", "voter": "0x4DAAc1943c42B5988629414af1c32936601E81ea", "created": 1638198266, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}]}
