ColorPixels is a decentralized live streaming platform that allows creators and gamers to make money from the minting of NFTs from clips during live events.\n\nColorPixels won best use of the Rarible Protocol for EthGlobal Hackathon.\n\nProblem\n\nLive Streaming reached new heights in 2020 and has continued to grow in 2021. But the way creators earn money hasn\u2019t evolved. Many have hopes of making a living from streaming daily, however platforms like Twitch and YouTube are still not transparent about payments for creators.\n\nOpportunity\n\nBy integrating ColorPixels with the Rarible Protocol and Twitch, we open the world of live streaming to transparent and innovative payments for creators. As we add features and scale it is important to integrate with a proven NFT marketplace that can handle the volume of NFTs that can be minted via popular gamers, musicians, sports, and more. ColorPixels is not built to be a Twitch competitor. We are built for creators to use as a tool for streaming to Twitch.\n\nUse of Funds\n\nFunds will be used to hire a designer, two developers, and pay myself (Jacoby DuBose) to work 40 hours / week for developing and marketing this project.\n\nMilestones & payments:\n\nPhase 1: Complete development of platform for public launch - $10,000 - Delivery Nov 14, 2021\n\nDesign & Branding\nCreator Profiles\nRarible Collections from Live Streams\nImprove Video Clipping service\nNFT Storage\nMulticasting Live Streams to Twitch and YouTube\nPhase 2: Fractionalize NFTs - $15,000 - Delivery December 11, 2021\n\nAdd artwork, filters, and designs for users to make creative NFTs from clips\nComplete development of NFT trading dashboard\nPayment will be made to the following ethereum address: 0x15ADeEBbDC451e289d341c84f7EFD3F945269D74\n\nUseful Links\n\nColorPixels won Best Use of the Rarible Protocol at EthGlobal Hackathon.\n\nhttps://showcase.ethglobal.com/ethonline2021/colorpixels", "choices": ["Approve", "Reject", "Abstain"], "start": 1637820360, "end": 1638568800, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [1, 3, 2], "scores_total": 6, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638568819, "snapshot": "21773489", "state": "closed", "author": "0x173a55e664c25986F7a2495998751A255793D1AB", "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth", "name": "Grants Working Group"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x4af6df722fa1773da7c49b7fb35d11e82a4671d8eafe88a817f208b4e10ce001", "voter": "0x70b71b98c8b95643462C68e0A396d0a6d15337bf", "created": 1638299724, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbkQ1uuyb82ojcTWkbK8xdGuFJFhZKjJYaXQPXuXYVqxU", "voter": "0x215B8974a7209df6368285232acfC6Ba8180bd47", "created": 1638234384, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x3ff30301e2abd39a7d447ae88c297579474da6120142c8124d7822f6a8cd8e10", "voter": "0x4171160dB0e7E2C75A4973b7523B437C010Dd9d4", "created": 1638233428, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0xcf67d78b3e16fe747a9126a0875f9271a3082506499cfc8ff6a3bf1f2641d4b2", "voter": "0x173a55e664c25986F7a2495998751A255793D1AB", "created": 1638231550, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x247481dc3b718a69cbf18c7a9adc9e396d4fff08346b0f3f6f741ac5f0cce207", "voter": "0x078eDe7D7174c81D4d3CCA8265f79F464E576013", "created": 1638229092, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x165562a85d179e03cf2f2affb258a04e6bfe1dbf859715d0425c747991085653", "voter": "0x4DAAc1943c42B5988629414af1c32936601E81ea", "created": 1638198128, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "daogrants.eth"}}]}
