The original team started large but many members had real life obligations and mixed feelings and over time left the team. I am currently working full time on this . At the start of the project many members had concerns with copyright issues about the name/logo of the token and fudded/scared away many holders. At present the game is under development but there is lack of zeal in the community with regards to doing anything to help the project.\n\nRecently, some members in the community suggested that we do a full relaunch and potential rebrand of the coin. All exisiting holders would have to send in their old coins and receive new coins, we would cancel the current game development and receive a refund to put towards the new relaunch. We will then make a new uniswap pool with liquidity. Many coins have done successful relaunches and it worked out for the best (eg. FLOKI) . With a proper distribution from the start, bot protection, and a fresh new vision I believe we can come back better than ever. \n\nWith a new relaunch there can be a new marketing blitz and new vision,logo and name. Right now we have have a sizeable budget to start the new token and push hard from the start and make the launch as big as possible. This was suggested by the community and for it to happen it must be voted on by holders and win by majority. If the result is no to relaunch then we will continue as normal with the game and then marketing the game once launched as per the original plan.\n\nPlease note, I did not suggest this idea, it was suggested by community members [bill tha butcher/AKS] and they asked me to write a short proposal.\n\nThis poll will run for ~48 hours. Please feel free to discuss other ideas that you see fit to engage the community again.\n\n\nPlease vote accordingly as this a community coin and all decisions have to be made by the community,", "choices": ["Yes, let's relaunch", "No, we shouldn't"], "start": 1637460600, "end": 1637639940, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [42.02669057340589, 9.59643130465748], "scores_total": 51.62312187806337, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1637639956, "snapshot": "13655459", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6C9355E3B3F85D74c22b61c4182c6aFE194ae626", "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth", "name": "Zeno"}, "votes": 18, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xa41ac584e905d3d5653ac3b79c77d0d7ac19e16bc7eda58f8986aeef527599a6", "voter": "0x64aed7B6d39bdF9aF8A4146A2fF4Dd0c782D5D68", "created": 1637630230, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPsr5ZSUrQPktbG3eCKDPH7zXeEchd8zC47Vg5JkBTDYx", "voter": "0xf9C893c9557B19d650ACEF2dDbdA20e366DC15bd", "created": 1637574600, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "QmREivqhRHDA2AyiBYosuMHHQhSJr2jow48dFkHWgMkmsr", "voter": "0x43EbE5673B140816Ef8c298fD282a29f18151a8E", "created": 1637572195, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "0x128805997a5fb3c06a572e2aa60c8c4c77f91846dc81a47984a816916c15887e", "voter": "0xFf2F1e53003329fD8499cF3dE164bB03bC615F0d", "created": 1637563678, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "0x747c2ab50680d2e07e585eae8241a9e8c5a17b2d9b6cb4f0b9bfc3c15be31872", "voter": "0xc2C253055733095c731CE3f75faBaf1F03096490", "created": 1637553257, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "0x35805bd7cc60f26510f9e39f822db8bcbd6cb3e8cf92b41ccc201f45ed60b707", "voter": "0x2DBAc95Ae162744b58AA58514E6bEdc0a3AcdcbF", "created": 1637548931, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUyZgpQsR4Hpk1Exyy9UZeH1We29ruiij5xjcBZQMN37d", "voter": "0x5EBb1B56DcBF7dD26F8e32D9f93908ace5957480", "created": 1637548785, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "0x23ac3490323ebf3f53fc95dd768ac7babba6cf8b5e2e6ffac569248df44d290b", "voter": "0x32598586a8B05902781de2c851297C99f4341c91", "created": 1637536674, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeSaMR7uf92nVbDUXBG1NNR68fbyK9PFELR4AM2gCg45t", "voter": "0x304f09c4Dc3Dc5120e6a5D40EE1f48CF61a8b554", "created": 1637520846, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "0x8779137220c1923fb7f8280544460c8fb2dee9e39bcb9d26fc8580102d10484f", "voter": "0xA8001422e07c28E151FCf4a8F2818cc226a02e0d", "created": 1637514883, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUCHgmfShDChv117EUK738koayfFyxW82LXxBML8F62ZS", "voter": "0xeaab0500145F9608CbCC2fF7b8CE61e6D5CB0E2A", "created": 1637513636, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVHmb25gP61iNkkxkzHYTSoY9jD4SCtEdJEGF6WsAKq8G", "voter": "0x88D56082bD23b7FEf3E13F1F44F1F8EDdd0Bb79D", "created": 1637497591, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVmFGkNeCoSvHjKzubHmut53MYKqTTfS5wrW9oex4gwVW", "voter": "0xe30Fd0f33EC377fEd555F225f8C6d02aE0C4c410", "created": 1637484065, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "0xa61dcbb30e708f8b4bff428131aee50c7c802312308994c61f932179c59d372c", "voter": "0xB7099ead1c2056b449aA0A25da297bc143345883", "created": 1637478970, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "0x032ec81b72626db72be7b194d6567c9343c105a0e21ac59a3a33f69a020da883", "voter": "0x8c7E0d32320938654BEE1d9a518a7C6F269117bE", "created": 1637472996, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT5FFfWcA3s3jExGmQyf9i2kt13RCEjHD87nu7uQ9wcsd", "voter": "0x5906e5fCf3Ddd4B063a83f8A34Aa245174184324", "created": 1637468437, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "0x09cb5d8356ec9c1532af7184fa92de1c906c67920f9fac29cdb5f02c9917fa24", "voter": "0x22c50b5B831748732920F39aAdA806f7e18B4832", "created": 1637462939, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQXUR1Y8FwV4Q1zs5futrAS6twcZtod4QPcUtAafCmy2h", "voter": "0x74F7c98Ce46B5372EC9B33996c7D52D93E09Dc65", "created": 1637461426, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zenoinu.eth"}}]}
