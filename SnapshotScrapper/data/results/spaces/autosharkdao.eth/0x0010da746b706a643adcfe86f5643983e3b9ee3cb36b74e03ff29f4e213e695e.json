Only the people panic sellings would choose to withdraw early. \n\nA. The penalty would depend on the % of time the asset has been locked in that specific locked-period. \nB. The more people wait to withdraw before the term, the lesser the penalty. \nC. The token rewards earned will be burned.\nD. The penalty would be shared fairly among stakers in that specific locked-time. \n\nThe penalty would be: \n- Between 0 to 19.9% of the locked time: 5% of the total amount locked.\n- Between 20% to 39.9% : 4% penalty\n- Between 40% to 59.9% : 3% penalty\n- Between 60% to 79.9% : 2% penalty\n- Between 80% to 99.9% : 1% penalty. \n\nFor example, \nIf Mark deposits 1000$ worth of sATLAS in a 30-day locked period and wants to withdraw after two weeks (14 days), this is 46.6% of the total priod and should pay a 3% penalty equal to 30$. His ATLAS reward gained (1000*0.7%*14 = 98$ worth of ATLAS) would be burned. His 3% penalty would be equally shared among the people staking in that 30-day period. \n\nThis would reassurace people who do not dare to lock their asset without being able to run away, it would reward people staking until the end of the term, and it would increase burn.
