He is the extremely religious, good-natured, cheery next-door neighbor to the Simpson family and is generally loathed by Homer Simpson \u2013 though there are numerous instances where the two are portrayed as good friends. A scrupulous and devout Evangelical Christian, he is among the friendliest and most compassionate of Springfield's residents and is generally considered a pillar of the Springfield community.\n\nHe was one of the first characters outside the immediate Simpson family to appear on the show, and has since been central to several episodes, the first being season two's \"Dead Putting Society\". His last name comes from Flanders St. in Portland, Oregon, the hometown of Simpsons creator Matt Groening. When he was created, he was intended to just be a neighbor who was very nice, but whom Homer abhorred.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1637757000, "end": 1638490020, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [41.853626619543334, 0], "scores_total": 41.853626619543334, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638490037, "snapshot": "13144303", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9c32555C64879004AC20a2192557eC48a2e4b807", "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth", "name": "Pizzap"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xe07f9110fc1be27c43fd0fb8ffd544e78c77cc852a9dd1be5c63e04a33479d91", "voter": "0x9c32555C64879004AC20a2192557eC48a2e4b807", "created": 1638489922, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}]}
