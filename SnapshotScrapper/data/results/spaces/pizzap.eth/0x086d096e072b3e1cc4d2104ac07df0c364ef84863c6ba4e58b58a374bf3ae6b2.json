Active for almost six decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. Diverging from the pop-rock of the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, heavier-driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable line-up comprised vocalist Mick Jagger, multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, guitarist Keith Richards, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts. During their formative years, Jones was the primary leader: he assembled the band, named it, and drove their sound and image. After Andrew Loog Oldham became the group's manager in 1963, he encouraged them to write their own songs. Jagger and Richards became the primary creative force behind the band, alienating Jones, who developed a drug addiction that interfered with his ability to contribute meaningfully.\n\nRooted in blues and early rock and roll, the Rolling Stones started out playing covers and were at the forefront of the British Invasion in 1964, also being identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. They then found greater success with their own material as \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" (1965), \"Get Off of My Cloud\" (1965) and \"Paint It Black\" (1966) became international No. 1 hits. Aftermath (1966) \u2013 their first entirely original album \u2013 is considered the most important of their formative records.[ In 1967, they had the double-sided hit \"Ruby Tuesday\"/\"Let's Spend the Night Together\" and experimented with psychedelic rock on Their Satanic Majesties Request. They returned to their roots with such hits as \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" (1968) and \"Honky Tonk Women\" (1969), and albums such as Beggars Banquet (1968), featuring \"Sympathy for the Devil\", and Let It Bleed (1969), featuring \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" and \"Gimme Shelter\". Let It Bleed was the first of five consecutive No. 1 albums in the UK.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1637757000, "end": 1638483600, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [49.493626619543335, 0], "scores_total": 49.493626619543335, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638483608, "snapshot": "13142124", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9c32555C64879004AC20a2192557eC48a2e4b807", "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth", "name": "Pizzap"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x5fb5d716300f406081038a9da4ffc68956f37f655179804ca74fbb71aad5a7e0", "voter": "0x1C64A68FAae0c625A5A628A57D6b9Fc92Ba400d3", "created": 1638483422, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb5e1ac6c580ce687c61065c0412be3b5fde2f33f13feb1986127ff872032ae01", "voter": "0x9c32555C64879004AC20a2192557eC48a2e4b807", "created": 1638483391, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}]}
