Buterin became involved with cryptocurrency early in its inception, co-founding Bitcoin Magazine in 2011. In 2014, Buterin launched Ethereum with Gavin Wood.\nButerin was born in Kolomna, Russia, to Dmitry Buterin, a computer scientist, and Natalia Ameline (n\u00e9e Chistyakova). He lived in the area until the age of six when his parents emigrated to Canada in search of better employment opportunities. While in grade three of an elementary school in Canada, Buterin was placed into a class for gifted children and was drawn to mathematics, programming, and economics.[8] Buterin then attended the Abelard School, a private high school in Toronto. Buterin learned about Bitcoin, from his father, at the age of 17.\n\nAfter high school, Buterin attended the University of Waterloo. There, he took advanced courses and was a research assistant for cryptographer Ian Goldberg, who co-created Off-the-Record Messaging and was the former board of directors chairman of the Tor Project. In 2012, he won a bronze medal in the International Olympiad in Informatics.\n\nIn 2013, he visited developers in other countries who shared his enthusiasm for code. He returned to Toronto later that year and published a white paper proposing Ethereum. He dropped out of university in 2014 when he was awarded a grant of $100,000 from the Thiel Fellowship, a scholarship created by venture capitalist Peter Thiel and went to work on Ethereum full-time.\n\nOn 25 June 2017, Buterin was the subject of a death hoax originating from 4chan. On 30 November 2018, Buterin received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Basel on the occasion of the Dies Academicus.\n\nOn 12 May 2021, he donated $1 billion worth of the cryptocurrencies Shiba Inu and Ether to a relief fund addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in India", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1637942400, "end": 1638550800, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [7.64, 0], "scores_total": 7.64, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638550821, "snapshot": "13140593", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9c32555C64879004AC20a2192557eC48a2e4b807", "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth", "name": "Pizzap"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x203580290a4a54352eb3d0172766b02dfc5debc37819e15f80a32e11d1cadd1a", "voter": "0x1C64A68FAae0c625A5A628A57D6b9Fc92Ba400d3", "created": 1638481082, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}]}
