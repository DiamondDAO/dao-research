Considered one of the pioneers of reggae, his musical career was marked by fusing elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady, as well as his distinctive vocal and songwriting style. Marley's contributions to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide and made him a global figure in popular culture for over a decade. Over the course of his career, Marley became known as a Rastafari icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality. He is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture and identity and was controversial in his outspoken support for democratic social reforms. In 1976, Marley survived an assassination attempt in his home, which was thought to be politically motivated. He also supported the legalization of marijuana and advocated for Pan-Africanism.\n\nBorn in Nine Mile, British Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming Bob Marley and the Wailers. The group released its debut studio album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, which contained the single \"One Love/People Get Ready\"; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae. The Wailers subsequently released eleven further studio albums; while initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with the singer's conversion to Rastafari. During this period Marley relocated to London, and the group embodied their musical shift with the release of the album The Best of The Wailers (1971)", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1637757000, "end": 1638483240, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [41.853626619543334, 0], "scores_total": 41.853626619543334, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638483248, "snapshot": "13142028", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9c32555C64879004AC20a2192557eC48a2e4b807", "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth", "name": "Pizzap"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x338bb1764dec9e581faffce697efb08d10e925524211f40f7695043a5bf1f17e", "voter": "0x9c32555C64879004AC20a2192557eC48a2e4b807", "created": 1638483080, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}]}
