He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \"Yellow Submarine\", \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Man\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\", and is credited as a co-writer of others.\n\nStarr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, with periods of prolonged hospitalization. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship as a machinist at a Liverpool school equipment manufacturer. Soon afterward, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll around early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes when he was asked to join the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best.\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1637872200, "end": 1638307800, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0.5, 0], "scores_total": 0.5, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638307833, "snapshot": "12953570", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6c665834015f725Bd27FECDA2394806BE3b8D6d9", "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth", "name": "Pizzap"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x7cd5082f13c095c2fc1bb2b6ccdb070f3aca5a13de4624945b2a2df52324a686", "voter": "0x6c665834015f725Bd27FECDA2394806BE3b8D6d9", "created": 1638080012, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}]}
