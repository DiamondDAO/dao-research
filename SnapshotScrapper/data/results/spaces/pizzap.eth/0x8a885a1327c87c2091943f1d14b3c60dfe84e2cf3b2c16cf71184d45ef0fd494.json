Stallone subsequently found gradual work as an extra or side character in films with a sizable budget until he achieved his greatest critical and commercial success as an actor and screenwriter, starting in 1976 with his role as boxer Rocky Balboa, in the first film of the successful Rocky series (1976\u2013present), for which he also wrote the screenplays.[2] In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog boxer who fights numerous brutal opponents, and wins the world heavyweight championship twice.\n\nIn 1977, Stallone was the third actor in cinema to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. Stallone's film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry, and had its props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. Stallone's use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps. Philadelphia has a statue of his character Rocky placed permanently near the museum, and he was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1637787600, "end": 1638636000, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [41.853626619543334, 0], "scores_total": 41.853626619543334, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638636030, "snapshot": "13192116", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9c32555C64879004AC20a2192557eC48a2e4b807", "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth", "name": "Pizzap"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xcfb4cd5e9eafc1be8f9f416790f4f05285b14a592367b1d2c3f6934b24de734f", "voter": "0x9c32555C64879004AC20a2192557eC48a2e4b807", "created": 1638635718, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}]}
