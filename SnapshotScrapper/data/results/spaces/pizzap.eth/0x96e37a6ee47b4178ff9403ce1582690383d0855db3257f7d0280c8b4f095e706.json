Only when we know crypto natives can we create products that belong to the new world order. crypto and the Internet are two completely different sets of logic, so this is also the most fundamental problem for many Internet people to enter the blockchain business failure. It only sees the user experience layer but knows nothing about the underlying logic, so they use the logic of the Internet to come up with something that looks very powerful but very strange. The demands of users entering the Crypto field are completely different from those of people entering the Internet products, the evaluation system is also different, the capital tendency is also different, and the circle approval standard is even different. So I especially emphasize that we need to keep learning those truly native projects and those people, to understand what is the core of what we need to understand.", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1637640600, "end": 1637647200, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [10, 4], "scores_total": 14, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1637647217, "snapshot": "12878949", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1EDD12f1815A168561Cb30b1e7d44B3C4376c99b", "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth", "name": "Pizzap"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x033052feea66e1e22227fa51375bc524ebd4a72ab8585963bb0408e90579a833", "voter": "0xb7a0f269468DA74E4b71569c903cf20ce4a507A8", "created": 1637647087, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1b3098d0f858fa793e0209dcd0b3af9cc0c8243188ff03bb078e5f7fdd86a54c", "voter": "0xB8dA6c79AA9fe6A8CAf62B2E8cD1705d9dA5C51a", "created": 1637646965, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}, {"id": "0xf1b8ffe31b8bce2d8a74880aa93607dc9640a81ed047500c2cce9d2ca11a923b", "voter": "0xb56b915971B98ec7d869B6B3aD6f4B2fd9F12492", "created": 1637646826, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}, {"id": "0x457b8a0dbcfc579de65742b73b2b65666f3ac482fc13c5a04cc9b985cba41474", "voter": "0x7bbe0FDB6584fc76224E1A8bC2728C4Ac2E17aDa", "created": 1637646820, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}, {"id": "0x09ae6679440f85bbdb428b7704987bba05ea3d62b8d775d025a5468853d0f357", "voter": "0xa1e8C3a026Ff0D0005E7e6c09c22b4D67017D4D9", "created": 1637646679, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}, {"id": "0x3a09c6b2f7a47cb9ec36be844264ae8fcbbaaab5a1ddf300bf265def990edd0a", "voter": "0x3162175FF0FE037e53573C6761AFc54ea9449988", "created": 1637646635, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe2c84614e701dfd5a7eed13119613edd0b139ee6f3bb4057b9e7b105bda25d4d", "voter": "0xD28D7BAe2BfeC169ABc7eCA4d765a2A886EA4ADF", "created": 1637646626, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}]}
