He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold an estimated 150 million records worldwide.\n\nBorn to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra was greatly influenced by the intimate, easy-listening vocal style of Bing Crosby and began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". Sinatra released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra, in 1946. However, by the early 1950s, his professional career had stalled and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best-known residency performers as part of the Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of the film From Here to Eternity, his performance subsequently earning him an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra then released several critically lauded albums, some of which are retrospectively noted as being among the first \"concept albums\", including In the Wee Small Hours (1955), Songs for Swingin' Lovers! (1956), Come Fly with Me (1958), Only the Lonely (1958), No One Cares (1959), and Nice 'n' Easy (1960.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1637874000, "end": 1638309600, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0.5, 0], "scores_total": 0.5, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638309633, "snapshot": "12953827", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6c665834015f725Bd27FECDA2394806BE3b8D6d9", "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth", "name": "Pizzap"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x9f53d908dfd7f14fec57628dfa01a15bf28ee44f646b61d595097dc79f1484e1", "voter": "0x6c665834015f725Bd27FECDA2394806BE3b8D6d9", "created": 1638079971, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}]}
