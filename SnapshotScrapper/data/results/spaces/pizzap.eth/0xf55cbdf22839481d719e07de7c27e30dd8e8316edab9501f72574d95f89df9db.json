He has sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has total sales of over 21.5 million singles in the United Kingdom and is the third-top-selling artist in UK Singles Chart history, behind the Beatles and Elvis Presley.\n\nRichard was originally marketed as a rebellious rock and roll singer in the style of Presley and Little Richard. With his backing group, The Shadows, he dominated the British popular music scene in the pre-Beatles period of the late 1950s to early 1960s.[5] His 1958 hit single \"Move It\" is often described as Britain's first authentic rock and roll song. In the early 1960s, he had a prosperous film career with films including The Young Ones and Summer Holiday. Increased focus on his Christianity and subsequent softening of his music led to a more middle-of-the-road image, and he sometimes ventured into contemporary Christian music.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1637874000, "end": 1638309600, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0.5, 0], "scores_total": 0.5, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638309634, "snapshot": "12953757", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6c665834015f725Bd27FECDA2394806BE3b8D6d9", "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth", "name": "Pizzap"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xf015957ca2ee5a2e5a8e79a178b0af8da5837de1d065020eef76d7549ab8ff7b", "voter": "0x6c665834015f725Bd27FECDA2394806BE3b8D6d9", "created": 1638079992, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pizzap.eth"}}]}
