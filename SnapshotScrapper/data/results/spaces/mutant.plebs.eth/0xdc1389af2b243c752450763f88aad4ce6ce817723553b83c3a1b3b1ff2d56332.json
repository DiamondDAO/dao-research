The name (we decide) for the mutant will appear in the acknowledgments section and will qualify for a cut of 50% of the profit as royalties, split with all other license holders.  Also, whichever wallet holds this mutant receives the royalties as they are paid out in perpetuity.   \n\nThis adds value to our Mutant on secondary markets and could provide passive income to the DAO from when royalties are first paid out until the DAO sells the mutant.  \n\nUnfortunately the Jenkins licensing portal only can use MetaMask - We will need approval to transfer Mutant to a MetaMask to link the Jenkins NFT + the Mutant Ape NFT and approve the license, then once the agreement is signed, return the mutant to the multi-sig.\n\nProposal to sign the agreement to license our Mutant to the Jenkins the Valet book, including transferring the mutant out and back. \n\n", "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"], "start": 1638205200, "end": 1638291600, "type": "basic", "scores": [5, 0, 0], "scores_total": 5, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638291639, "snapshot": "21942685", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4e59C95da360ED2Ab521814bAcb30901d283986d", "space": {"id": "mutant.plebs.eth", "name": "Plebs Mutant DAO"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x8b7139f12eac28f2a47739618dcc132d9a4c7f7b832d8e904d6b763feb88afc9", "voter": "0x1B606669031e37f49CF305471D4c21179d7749FA", "created": 1638242477, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mutant.plebs.eth"}}, {"id": "0xeb17d89790b1759d9bfb40b7ece37a6380ad528b7cce7ee8bf3e75f313157f25", "voter": "0xde3e3B60d7e513A9478bA354e799B70fC9ED65eC", "created": 1638229601, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mutant.plebs.eth"}}, {"id": "0xd065bec0b0e9a37187f7930204b038d87f90f5fca946dc53cf52584ce4c8fa97", "voter": "0x9A84915DFf8F8801b26D0b35b199E5C16E29f899", "created": 1638229433, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mutant.plebs.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb0bd82f935f270840221d25ba8f4c279425d759e5aaa38afac522da1852babb0", "voter": "0x41dd6909535E44b13c88330EB9268751eE8cEd4C", "created": 1638228746, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mutant.plebs.eth"}}, {"id": "0xbf3f349573abd04d86165df127e639dbbd093d245b8c5353c545f9e3f8afa029", "voter": "0x4e59C95da360ED2Ab521814bAcb30901d283986d", "created": 1638205276, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mutant.plebs.eth"}}]}
