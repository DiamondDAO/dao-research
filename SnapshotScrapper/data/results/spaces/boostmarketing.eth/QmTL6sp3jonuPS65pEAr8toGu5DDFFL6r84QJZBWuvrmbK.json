In our first vote as a community, we'll decide what to do with the Liquidity on Uniswap, which is set to unlock on November 9th, 2021. The choices are to re-lock the pool, for a duration of time which we would vote on if this measure passes. The second choice is to break the Liquidity into two parts: 80% would remain in the current pool, and the remaining 20% would be migrated to a new pool on Uniswap, but located on the Arbitrum Network, a Layer 2 Ethereum Network. Many have expressed their frustration over the high cost of gas, and this would allow us to offer $BOOST trades for 90-95% less gas! There are two critical things to consider when voting. 1) Those who are not regularly monitoring updates may become concerned by seeing less ethereum in our main pool, and without the proper context, they might draw misguided conclusions. 2) Arbitrum requires traders to bridge their ethereum to their network. While a relatively simple process, there may be some challenges for novices. There is also a gas fee to bridge the ethereum, though currently it runs between $20-$40. Lastly, in order to bridge the ethereum back to mainnet, there is a hold period of 7 days in order to prevent attempted fake transactions from processing on mainnet.
