We are building a web3 community that is paving the way for anyone to be able to become a designer, if they so choose. And that includes us, the current members. We need better resources and content to compete and thrive in this market. \n\nThink about platforms like Sketchfab, the Epic Store, Unsplash, Mixamo etc. All of these platforms pool together assets, elements and ingredients that any creator can use, allowing for a much greater flourishing of wealth for and from each person that uses it. \n\nIt's possible only because of indirect reciprocity. The open sourcing of assets that we may not recognise the value of ourselves makes it more likely that someone else will, and, that we will have more available to us to use in turn. \n\nIt also increases our defensibility against the overly capitalised and closed off robber barrens of web2 and previous culture. Which is all too real in trad fashion. \n\nBy open sourcing resources we level the playing field to outcompete them on the merits. And, open source is at the heart of the GDN. If we keep a web2 scarcity, fear and instant gratification mindset that keeping our assets \"all locked up\" will somehow help us do better at the expense of others, we are NGMI. Because, web3 does not reward or incentivise that. Instead, those who are generous and have an abundance mindset combined with genuine creative and market savvy, actually end up far far ahead. \n\nSo, with that said, my proposal is to start creating an open source content and resource library for any member of the GDN to be able to access. Everything from assets (i.e. models, environments, scenes) to tutorials to workshops and courses. Ultimately, anything that you wish would have been made available to you for free to help you accelerate your journey. \n\nWe can figure out how to best collate this information and resources (i.e. maybe a google drive to start etc.). Contributing to this is all about the indirect benefit, we gift these resources to each other without the expectation of direct compensation, but rather, confident knowing that it will benefit all of us, including ourselves, when harvest time comes. \n\nThis is a direct example of min-maxing for squad wealth. We are only as strong as our lowest level party member. So, why shouldn't we do everything possible to help them level up as quickly as possible? \n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1635015600, "end": 1635361200, "type": "quadratic", "scores":
