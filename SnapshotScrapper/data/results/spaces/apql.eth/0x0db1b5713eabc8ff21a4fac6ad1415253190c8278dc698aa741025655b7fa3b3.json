They have conferred on the poor, on widows and orphans, the right to have their meadows mown three days in advance of every one else. They rebuild their houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined. Therefore it is a country which is blessed by God.\rFor a whole century, there has not been a single murderer among them.\"\rIn villages which were greedy for profit and harvest, he said: \"Look at the people of Embrun!\rIf, at the harvest season, the father of a family has his son away on service in the army, and his daughters at service in the town, and if he is ill and incapacitated, the cure recommends him to the prayers of the congregation; and on Sunday, after the mass, all the inhabitants of the village--men, women, and children--go to the poor man's field and do his harvesting for him, and carry his straw and his grain to his granary.\" To families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said: \"Look at the mountaineers of Devolny, a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years.\rWell, when the father of a family dies, the boys go off to seek their fortunes, leaving the property to the girls, so that they may find husbands.\" To the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits, and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper, he said:\r\"Look at those good peasants in the valley of Queyras!\rThere are three thousand souls of them. Mon Dieu! it is like a little republic.\rNeither judge nor bailiff is known there.\rThe mayor does everything.\rShe persisted in her denial.\rThereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown. He invented an infidelity on the part of the lover, and succeeded, by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented, in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival, and that the man was deceiving her.\rThereupon, exasperated by jealousy, she denounced her lover, confessed all, proved all.\rThe man was ruined.\rHe was shortly to be tried at Aix with his accomplice.\rThey were relating the matter, and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate. By bringing jealousy into play, he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath, he had educed the justice of revenge.\rThe Bishop listened to all this in silence.\rWhen they had finished, he inquired,--\r\"Where are this man and woman to be tried?\"\r\"At the Court of Assizes.\"\rHe went on, \"And where will the advocate of the crown be tried?\"\rA tragic event occurred at D---- A man was condemned to death for murder.\rHe was a wretched fellow, not exactly educated, not exactly ignorant, who had been a mountebank at fairs, and a writer for the public.\rThe town took a great interest in the trial. On the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man, the chaplain of the prison fell ill.\rA priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments.\rThey sent for the cure. It seems that he refused to come, saying, \"That is no affair of mine.\rI have nothing to do with that unpleasant task, and with that mountebank:\rI, too, am ill; and besides, it is not my place.\" This reply was reported to the Bishop, who said, \"Monsieur le Cure is right:\rit is not his place; it is mine.\"\rHe went instantly to the prison, descended to the cell of the \"mountebank,\" called him by name, took him by the hand, and spoke to him. He passed the entire day with him, forgetful of food and sleep, praying to God for the soul of the condemned man, and praying the condemned man for his own.\rHe told him the best truths, which are also the most simple.\rHe was father, brother, friend; he was bishop only to bless.\rHe taught him everything, encouraged and consoled him. The man was on the point of dying in despair.\rDeath was an abyss to him. As he stood trembling on its mournful brink, he recoiled with horror. He was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent. His condemnation, which had been a profound shock, had, in a manner, broken through, here and there, that wall which separates us from the mystery of things, and which we call life.\rHe gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches, and beheld only darkness.\rThe Bishop made him see light.\rOn the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, the Bishop was still there.\rHe followed him, and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords.\rHe mounted the tumbril with him, he mounted the scaffold with him. The sufferer, who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day, was radiant.\rHe felt that his soul was reconciled, and he hoped in God.\rThe Bishop embraced him, and at the moment when the knife was about to fall, he said to him:\r\"God raises from the dead him whom man slays; he whom his brothers have rejected finds his Father once more.\rPray, believe, enter into life:\rthe Father is there.\" When he descended from the scaffold, there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass.\rThey did not know which was most worthy of admiration, his pallor or his serenity. On his return to the humble dwelling, which he designated, with a smile, as his palace, he said to his sister, \"I have just officiated pontifically.\"\rSince the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood, there were people in the town who said, when commenting on this conduct of the Bishop, \"It is affectation.\"\rThis, however, was a remark which was confined to the drawing-rooms. The populace, which perceives no jest in holy deeds, was touched, and admired him.\rAs for the Bishop, it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine, and it was a long time before he recovered from it.\rIn fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected and prepared, it has something about it which produces hallucination. One may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing upon it, from saying yes or no, so long as one has not seen a guillotine with one's own eyes: but if one encounters one of them, the shock is violent; one is forced to decide, and to take part for or against. Some admire it, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like Beccaria. The guillotine is the concretion of the law; it is called vindicte; it is not neutral, and it does not permit you to remain neutral. He who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers. All social problems erect their interrogation point around this chopping-knife. The scaffold is a vision.\rThe scaffold is not a piece of carpentry; the scaffold is not a machine; the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood, iron and cords.\rIt seems as though it were a being, possessed of I know not what sombre initiative; one would say that this piece of carpenter's work saw, that this machine heard, that this mechanism understood, that this wood, this iron, and these cords were possessed of will. In the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise, and as though taking part in what is going on.\rThe scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner; it devours, it eats flesh, it drinks blood; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter, a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted.\rTherefore, the impression was terrible and profound; on the day following the execution, and on many succeeding days, the Bishop appeared to be crushed.\rThe almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice tormented him.\rHe, who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction, seemed to be reproaching himself. At times he talked to himself, and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice.\rThis is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved:\r\"I did not think that it was so monstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law.\rDeath belongs to God alone. By what right do men touch that unknown thing?\"\rIn course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished. Nevertheless, it was observed that the Bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution.\rM. Myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying.\rHe did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and his greatest labor.\rWidowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him; he came of his own accord.\rHe understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love, of the mother who had lost her child.\rAs he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech.\rOh, admirable consoler!\rHe sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness, but to magnify and dignify it by hope.\rHe said:--\r\"Have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead. Think not of that which perishes.\rGaze steadily.\rYou will perceive the living light of your well-beloved dead in the depths of heaven.\" He knew that faith is wholesome.\rHe sought to counsel and calm the despairing man, by pointing out to him the resigned man, and to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER V \r MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU MADE HIS CASSOCKS LAST TOO LONG \r The private life of M. Myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his public life.\rThe voluntary poverty in which the Bishop of D---- lived, would have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have viewed it close at hand.\rLike all old men, and like the majority of thinkers, he slept little. This brief slumber was profound.\rIn the morning he meditated for an hour, then he said his mass, either at the cathedral or in his own house. His mass said, he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows.\rThen he set to work.\rA Bishop is a very busy man:\rhe must every day receive the secretary of the bishopric, who is generally a canon, and nearly every day his vicars-general. He has congregations to reprove, privileges to grant, a whole ecclesiastical library to examine,-- prayer-books, diocesan catechisms, books of hours, etc.,--charges to write, sermons to authorize, cures and mayors to reconcile, a clerical correspondence, an administrative correspondence; on one side the State, on the other the Holy See; and a thousand matters of business.\rWhat time was left to him, after these thousand details of business, and his offices and his breviary, he bestowed first on the necessitous, the sick, and the afflicted; the time which was left to him from the afflicted, the sick, and the necessitous, he devoted to work. Sometimes he dug in his garden; again, he read or wrote.\rHe had but one word for both these kinds of toil; he called them gardening. \"The mind is a garden,\" said he.\rTowards mid-day, when the weather was fine, he went forth and took a stroll in the country or in town, often entering lowly dwellings. He was seen walking alone, buried in his own thoughts, his eyes cast down, supporting himself on his long cane, clad in his wadded purple garment of silk, which was very warm, wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes, and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points.\rIt was a perfect festival wherever he appeared.\rOne would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it. The children and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as for the sun.\rHe bestowed his blessing, and they blessed him. They pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646516, "end": 1639905716, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905741, "snapshot": "1639646516", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5Fa3c5f7811d86f38896510b3D28Ba47C4Fdaf7B", "space": {"id": "apql.eth", "name": "apql"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
