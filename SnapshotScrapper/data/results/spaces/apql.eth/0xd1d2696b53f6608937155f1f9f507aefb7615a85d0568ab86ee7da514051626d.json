'93!\"\rThe member of the Convention straightened himself up in his chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity, and exclaimed, so far as a dying man is capable of exclamation:--\r\"Ah, there you go; '93!\rI was expecting that word.\rA cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years; at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst.\rYou are putting the thunderbolt on its trial.\"\rThe Bishop felt, without, perhaps, confessing it, that something within him had suffered extinction.\rNevertheless, he put a good face on the matter.\rHe replied:--\r\"The judge speaks in the name of justice; the priest speaks in the name of pity, which is nothing but a more lofty justice. A thunderbolt should commit no error.\"\rAnd he added, regarding the member of the Convention steadily the while, \"Louis XVII.?\"\rThe conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the Bishop's arm.\r\"I persist,\" continued the conventionary G---- \"You have mentioned Louis XVII.\rto me.\rLet us come to an understanding.\rShall we weep for all the innocent, all martyrs, all children, the lowly as well as the exalted?\rI agree to that.\rBut in that case, as I have told you, we must go back further than '93, and our tears must begin before Louis XVII.\rI will weep with you over the children of kings, provided that you will weep with me over the children of the people.\"\r\"I weep for all,\" said the Bishop.\r\"Equally!\" exclaimed conventionary G----; \"and if the balance must incline, let it be on the side of the people.\rThey have been suffering longer.\"\rAnother silence ensued.\rThe conventionary was the first to break it. He raised himself on one elbow, took a bit of his cheek between his thumb and his forefinger, as one does mechanically when one interrogates and judges, and appealed to the Bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of the death agony.\rIt was almost an explosion.\r\"Yes, sir, the people have been suffering a long while.\rAnd hold! that is not all, either; why have you just questioned me and talked to me about Louis XVII.? I know you not.\rEver since I have been in these parts I have dwelt in this enclosure alone, never setting foot outside, and seeing no one but that child who helps me. Your name has reached me in a confused manner, it is true, and very badly pronounced, I must admit; but that signifies nothing:\rclever men have so many ways of imposing on that honest goodman, the people. By the way, I did not hear the sound of your carriage; you have left it yonder, behind the coppice at the fork of the roads, no doubt. I do not know you, I tell you.\rYou have told me that you are the Bishop; but that affords me no information as to your moral personality. In short, I repeat my question.\rWho are you?\rI have done my duty according to my powers, and all the good that I was able. After which, I was hunted down, pursued, persecuted, blackened, jeered at, scorned, cursed, proscribed.\rFor many years past, I with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they have the right to despise me; to the poor ignorant masses I present the visage of one damned.\rAnd I accept this isolation of hatred, without hating any one myself.\rNow I am eighty-six years old; I am on the point of death.\rWhat is it that you have come to ask of me?\"\r\"Your blessing,\" said the Bishop.\rAnd he knelt down.\rWhen the Bishop raised his head again, the face of the conventionary had become august.\rHe had just expired.\rThe Bishop returned home, deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannot be known to us.\rHe passed the whole night in prayer. On the following morning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about member of the Convention G----; he contented himself with pointing heavenward.\rFrom that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers.\rAny allusion to \"that old wretch of a G----\" caused him to fall into a singular preoccupation.\rNo one could say that the passage of that soul before his, and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his, did not count for something in his approach to perfection.\rThis \"pastoral visit\" naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coteries.\r\"Was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop?\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646663, "end": 1639905863, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905891, "snapshot": "1639646663", "state": "closed", "author": "0x22e0e43fA3bAA29e530Da54fEA7A8B24E367c9C3", "space": {"id": "apql.eth", "name": "apql"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
