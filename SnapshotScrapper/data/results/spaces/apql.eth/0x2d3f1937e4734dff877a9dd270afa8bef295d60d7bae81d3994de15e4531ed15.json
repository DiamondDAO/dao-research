Myriel, \"you are looking at a good man, and I at a great man.\rEach of us can profit by it.\"\rThat very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Cure, and some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed Bishop of D----\rWhat truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of M. Myriel's life?\rNo one knew. Very few families had been acquainted with the Myriel family before the Revolution.\rM. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town, where there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think. He was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and because he was a bishop.\rBut after all, the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only,--noise, sayings, words; less than words-- palabres, as the energetic language of the South expresses it.\rHowever that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in D----, all the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion.\rNo one would have dared to mention them; no one would have dared to recall them.\rM. Myriel had arrived at D---- accompanied by an elderly spinster, Mademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his junior.\rTheir only domestic was a female servant of the same age as Mademoiselle Baptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having been the servant of M. le Cure, now assumed the double title of maid to Mademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.\rMademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; she realized the ideal expressed by the word \"respectable\"; for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. She had never been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen. She was a soul rather than a virgin.\rHer person seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever drooping;-- a mere pretext for a soul's remaining on the earth.\rMadame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and bustling; always out of breath,--in the first place, because of her activity, and in the next, because of her asthma.\rOn his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop immediately after a major-general. The mayor and the president paid the first call on him, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the general and the prefect.\rThe installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER II \rM. MYRIEL BECOMES M. WELCOME \rThe episcopal palace of D---- adjoins the hospital.\rThe episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone at the beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology of the Faculty of Paris, Abbe of Simore, who had been Bishop of D---- in 1712.\rThis palace was a genuine seignorial residence. Everything about it had a grand air,--the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms, the chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks encircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens planted with magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superb gallery which was situated on the ground-floor and opened on the gardens, M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, My Lords Charles Brulart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d'Embrun; Antoine de Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendome, Grand Prior of France, Abbe of Saint Honore de Lerins; Francois de Berton de Crillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; Cesar de Sabran de Forcalquier, bishop, Seignor of Glandeve; and Jean Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, preacher in ordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of Senez. The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment; and this memorable date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble.\rThe hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with a small garden.\rThree days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. The visit ended, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house.\r\"Monsieur the director of the hospital,\" said he to him, \"how many sick people have you at the present moment?\"\r\"Twenty-six, Monseigneur.\"\r\"That was the number which I counted,\" said the Bishop.\r\"The beds,\" pursued the director, \"are very much crowded against each other.\"\r\"That is what I observed.\"\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER VIII \rPHILOSOPHY AFTER DRINKING \r The senator above mentioned was a clever man, who had made his own way, heedless of those things which present obstacles, and which are called conscience, sworn faith, justice, duty:\rhe had marched straight to his goal, without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest.\rHe was an old attorney, softened by success; not a bad man by any means, who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons, his sons-in-law, his relations, and even to his friends, having wisely seized upon, in life, good sides, good opportunities, good windfalls. Everything else seemed to him very stupid.\rHe was intelligent, and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of Epicurus; while he was, in reality, only a product of Pigault-Lebrun. He laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things, and at the \"Crotchets of that good old fellow the Bishop.\" He even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel himself, who listened to him.\rOn some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect what, Count*** [this senator] and M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect. At dessert, the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, though still perfectly dignified, exclaimed:--\r\"Egad, Bishop, let's have a discussion.\rIt is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking.\rWe are two augurs. I am going to make a confession to you.\rI have a philosophy of my own.\"\r\"And you are right,\" replied the Bishop.\r\"As one makes one's philosophy, so one lies on it.\rYou are on the bed of purple, senator.\"\rThe senator was encouraged, and went on:--\r\"Let us be good fellows.\"\r\"Good devils even,\" said the Bishop.\r\"I declare to you,\" continued the senator, \"that the Marquis d'Argens, Pyrrhon, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are no rascals. I have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges.\"\r\"Like yourself, Count,\" interposed the Bishop.\rThe senator resumed:--\r\"I hate Diderot; he is an ideologist, a declaimer, and a revolutionist, a believer in God at bottom, and more bigoted than Voltaire. Voltaire made sport of Needham, and he was wrong, for Needham's eels prove that God is useless.\rMy drawing-room, which contains no furniture, and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing, is fifteen feet in height, eighteen square, with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded, and with beams, as in yours. This was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital. And the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers.\rBut my room is the one you ought to see.\rMadam Magloire has discovered, under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top, some paintings, which without being good are very tolerable.\rThe subject is Telemachus being knighted by Minerva in some gardens, the name of which escapes me.\rIn short, where the Roman ladies repaired on one single night.\rWhat shall I say to you?\rI have Romans, and Roman ladies [here occurs an illegible word], and the whole train. Madam Magloire has cleaned it all off; this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired, and the whole revarnished, and my chamber will be a regular museum.\rShe has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables of ancient fashion. They asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them, but it is much better to give the money to the poor; and they are very ugly besides, and I should much prefer a round table of mahogany.\rI am always very happy.\rMy brother is so good.\rHe gives all he has to the poor and sick.\rWe are very much cramped.\rThe country is trying in the winter, and we really must do something for those who are in need.\rWe are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that these are great treats.\rMy brother has ways of his own.\rWhen he talks, he says that a bishop ought to be so.\rJust imagine! the door of our house is never fastened. Whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother's room. He fears nothing, even at night.\rThat is his sort of bravery, he says.\rHe does not wish me or Madame Magloire feel any fear for him. He exposes himself to all sorts of dangers, and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it.\rOne must know how to understand him.\rYesterday, only my feet were cold; to-day, the chill has ascended to my knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; when it reaches the heart, I shall stop.\rThe sun is beautiful, is it not?\rI had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things.\rYou can talk to me; it does not fatigue me.\rYou have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death. It is well that there should be witnesses at that moment.\rOne has one's caprices; I should have liked to last until the dawn, but I know that I shall hardly live three hours.\rIt will be night then. What does it matter, after all?\rDying is a simple affair. One has no need of the light for that.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646598, "end": 1639905798, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905831, "snapshot": "1639646598", "state": "closed", "author": "0xfe580A5B7256b81DF7B7A138e8C26e426609de84", "space": {"id": "apql.eth", "name": "apql"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
