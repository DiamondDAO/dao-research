He was already advanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.\rAbout the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with his curacy--just what, is not precisely known--took him to Paris.\rSo be it.\rI shall die by starlight.\"\rThe old man turned to the shepherd lad:--\r\"Go to thy bed; thou wert awake all last night; thou art tired.\"\rThe child entered the hut.\rThe old man followed him with his eyes, and added, as though speaking to himself:--\r\"I shall die while he sleeps.\rThe two slumbers may be good neighbors.\"\rThe Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He did not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the whole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest:\rhe, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at \"His Grace,\" was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and he was almost tempted to retort \"citizen.\" He was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but which was not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of the Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the powerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably, the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.\rMeanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality, in which one could have distinguished, possibly, that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust.\rThe Bishop, on his side, although he generally restrained his curiosity, which, in his opinion, bordered on a fault, could not refrain from examining the member of the Convention with an attention which, as it did not have its course in sympathy, would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A member of the Convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law, even of the law of charity.\rG----, calm, his body almost upright, his voice vibrating, was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist. The Revolution had many of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof. Though so near to his end, he preserved all the gestures of health. In his clear glance, in his firm tone, in the robust movement of his shoulders, there was something calculated to disconcert death. Azrael, the Mohammedan angel of the sepulchre, would have turned back, and thought that he had mistaken the door.\rG---- seemed to be dying because he willed it so.\rThere was freedom in his agony.\rHis legs alone were motionless.\rIt was there that the shadows held him fast. His feet were cold and dead, but his head survived with all the power of life, and seemed full of light.\rG----, at this solemn moment, resembled the king in that tale of the Orient who was flesh above and marble below.\rThere was a stone there.\rThe Bishop sat down.\rThe exordium was abrupt.\r\"I congratulate you,\" said he, in the tone which one uses for a reprimand.\r\"You did not vote for the death of the king, after all.\"\rThe old member of the Convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words \"after all.\"\rHe replied. The smile had quite disappeared from his face.\r\"Do not congratulate me too much, sir.\rI did vote for the death of the tyrant.\"\rIt was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity.\r\"What do you mean to say?\" resumed the Bishop.\r\"I mean to say that man has a tyrant,--ignorance.\rI voted for the death of that tyrant.\rThat tyrant engendered royalty, which is authority falsely understood, while science is authority rightly understood. Man should be governed only by science.\"\r\"And conscience,\" added the Bishop.\r\"It is the same thing.\rConscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us.\"\rMonseigneur Bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language, which was very new to him.\rThe member of the Convention resumed:--\r\"So far as Louis XVI.\rwas concerned, I said `no.' I did not think that I had the right to kill a man; but I felt it my duty to exterminate evil.\rI voted the end of the tyrant, that is to say, the end of prostitution for woman, the end of slavery for man, the end of night for the child.\rIn voting for the Republic, I voted for that.\rI voted for fraternity, concord, the dawn. I have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and errors.\rThe crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light.\rWe have caused the fall of the old world, and the old world, that vase of miseries, has become, through its upsetting upon the human race, an urn of joy.\"\r\"Mixed joy,\" said the Bishop.\r\"You may say troubled joy, and to-day, after that fatal return of the past, which is called 1814, joy which has disappeared! Alas!\rThe work was incomplete, I admit:\rwe demolished the ancient regime in deeds; we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas. To destroy abuses is not sufficient; customs must be modified. The mill is there no longer; the wind is still there.\"\r\"You have demolished.\rIt may be of use to demolish, but I distrust a demolition complicated with wrath.\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646622, "end": 1639905822, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905831, "snapshot": "1639646622", "state": "closed", "author": "0x772cBaa607523b76460976b0206629A483777a21", "space": {"id": "apql.eth", "name": "apql"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
