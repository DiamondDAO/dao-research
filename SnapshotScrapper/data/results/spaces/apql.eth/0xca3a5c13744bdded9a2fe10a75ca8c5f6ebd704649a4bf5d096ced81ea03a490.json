What took place next in the fate of M. Myriel?\rThe ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fall of his own family, the tragic spectacles of '93, which were, perhaps, even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance, with the magnifying powers of terror,--did these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him?\rWas he, in the midst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life, suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastrophes would not shake, by striking at his existence and his fortune?\rNo one could have told:\rall that was known was, that when he returned from Italy he was a priest.\r\"Right has its wrath, Bishop; and the wrath of right is an element of progress.\rIn any case, and in spite of whatever may be said, the French Revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of Christ.\rIncomplete, it may be, but sublime. It set free all the unknown social quantities; it softened spirits, it calmed, appeased, enlightened; it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth.\rThere was evidently no conversion to be expected. All those revolutionists are backsliders.\rThen why go there? What was there to be seen there?\rHe must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried off by the devil.\"\rOn another occasion he said, \"What would you have?\rThose gentlemen are princes.\rI am only a poor peasant bishop.\"\rThe fact is that he displeased them.\rAmong other strange things, it is said that he chanced to remark one evening, when he found himself at the house of one of his most notable colleagues:\r\"What beautiful clocks!\rWhat beautiful carpets!\rWhat beautiful liveries! They must be a great trouble.\rI would not have all those superfluities, crying incessantly in my ears:\r`There are people who are hungry! There are people who are cold!\rThere are poor people!\rThere are poor people!'\"\rLet us remark, by the way, that the hatred of luxury is not an intelligent hatred.\rThis hatred would involve the hatred of the arts.\rNevertheless, in churchmen, luxury is wrong, except in connection with representations and ceremonies.\rIt seems to reveal habits which have very little that is charitable about them. An opulent priest is a contradiction.\rThe priest must keep close to the poor.\rNow, can one come in contact incessantly night and day with all this distress, all these misfortunes, and this poverty, without having about one's own person a little of that misery, like the dust of labor?\rIs it possible to imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm?\rCan one imagine a workman who is working near a furnace, and who has neither a singed hair, nor blackened nails, nor a drop of sweat, nor a speck of ashes on his face?\rThe first proof of charity in the priest, in the bishop especially, is poverty.\rThis is, no doubt, what the Bishop of D---- thought.\rIt must not be supposed, however, that he shared what we call the \"ideas of the century\" on certain delicate points.\rHe took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment, and maintained silence on questions in which Church and State were implicated; but if he had been strongly pressed, it seems that he would have been found to be an ultramontane rather than a gallican.\rSince we are making a portrait, and since we do not wish to conceal anything, we are forced to add that he was glacial towards Napoleon in his decline. Beginning with 1813, he gave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations.\rHe refused to see him, as he passed through on his return from the island of Elba, and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the Emperor in his diocese during the Hundred Days.\rBesides his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, he had two brothers, one a general, the other a prefect.\rHe wrote to both with tolerable frequency.\rHe was harsh for a time towards the former, because, holding a command in Provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at Cannes, the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the Emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing to escape.\rHis canons and grand-vicars were good old men, rather vulgar like himself, walled up like him in this diocese, without exit to a cardinalship, and who resembled their bishop, with this difference, that they were finished and he was completed.\rThe impossibility of growing great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so well understood, that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix or of Auch, and went off in a great hurry.\rFor, in short, we repeat it, men wish to be pushed.\rA saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor; he might communicate to you, by contagion, an incurable poverty, an anchylosis of the joints, which are useful in advancement, and in short, more renunciation than you desire; and this infectious virtue is avoided.\rHe who triumphs is venerated.\rBe born with a silver spoon in your mouth! everything lies in that.\rBe lucky, and you will have all the rest; be happy, and people will think you great.\rOutside of five or six immense exceptions, which compose the splendor of a century, contemporary admiration is nothing but short-sightedness. Gilding is gold.\rIt does no harm to be the first arrival by pure chance, so long as you do arrive.\rThe common herd is an old Narcissus who adores himself, and who applauds the vulgar herd.\rThat enormous ability by virtue of which one is Moses, Aeschylus, Dante, Michael Angelo, or Napoleon, the multitude awards on the spot, and by acclamation, to whomsoever attains his object, in whatsoever it may consist. Let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy:\rlet a false Corneille compose Tiridate; let a eunuch come to possess a harem; let a military Prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch; let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe-soles for the army of the Sambre-and-Meuse, and construct for himself, out of this cardboard, sold as leather, four hundred thousand francs of income; let a pork-packer espouse usury, and cause it to bring forth seven or eight millions, of which he is the father and of which it is the mother; let a preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl; let the steward of a fine family be so rich on retiring from service that he is made minister of finances,--and men call that Genius, just as they call the face of Mousqueton Beauty, and the mien of Claude Majesty.\rWith the constellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which are made in the soft mire of the puddle by the feet of ducks.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER XIII \rWHAT HE BELIEVED\r We are not obliged to sound the Bishop of D---- on the score of orthodoxy.\rIn the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect.\rThe conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word.\rMoreover, certain natures being given, we admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own.\rWhat did he think of this dogma, or of that mystery?\rThese secrets of the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb, where souls enter naked.\rThe point on which we are certain is, that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case.\rNo decay is possible to the diamond. He believed to the extent of his powers.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646697, "end": 1639905897, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905921, "snapshot": "1639646697", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2b9b100c1e84410feB83A80E3809b419589734c0", "space": {"id": "apql.eth", "name": "apql"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
