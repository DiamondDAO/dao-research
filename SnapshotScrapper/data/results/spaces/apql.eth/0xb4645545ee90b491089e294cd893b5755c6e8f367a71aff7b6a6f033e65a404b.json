Is it for the royal child?\rI demand time for reflection. To me, the brother of Cartouche, an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the Place de Greve, until death ensued, for the sole crime of having been the brother of Cartouche, is no less painful than the grandson of Louis XV., an innocent child, martyred in the tower of the Temple, for the sole crime of having been grandson of Louis XV.\"\r\"Monsieur,\" said the Bishop, \"I like not this conjunction of names.\"\r\"Cartouche?\rLouis XV.? To which of the two do you object?\"\rA momentary silence ensued.\rThe Bishop almost regretted having come, and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken.\rThe conventionary resumed:--\r\"Ah, Monsieur Priest, you love not the crudities of the true. Christ loved them.\rHe seized a rod and cleared out the Temple. His scourge, full of lightnings, was a harsh speaker of truths. When he cried, `Sinite parvulos,' he made no distinction between the little children.\rIt would not have embarrassed him to bring together the Dauphin of Barabbas and the Dauphin of Herod.\rInnocence, Monsieur, is its own crown.\rInnocence has no need to be a highness. It is as august in rags as in fleurs de lys.\"\r\"That is true,\" said the Bishop in a low voice.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646610, "end": 1639905810, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905831, "snapshot": "1639646610", "state": "closed", "author": "0x633bC6ce4cbb9d4515eE6273E6856fDDeF8b6285", "space": {"id": "apql.eth", "name": "apql"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
