There is evidently a mistake here.\rThere are thirty-six of you, in five or six small rooms.\rThere are three of us here, and we have room for sixty.\rThere is some mistake, I tell you; you have my house, and I have yours.\rGive me back my house; you are at home here.\"\rOn the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in the Bishop's palace, and the Bishop was settled in the hospital.\rM. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by the Revolution.\rHis sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs, which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage.\rM. Myriel received from the State, in his quality of bishop, a salary of fifteen thousand francs.\rOn the very day when he took up his abode in the hospital, M. Myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all, in the following manner. We transcribe here a note made by his own hand:--\r NOTE ON THE REGULATION OF MY HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.\rFor the little seminary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,500 livres \rSociety of the mission . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100 \" \rFor the Lazarists of Montdidier . . . . . . . . . . 100 \" \rSeminary for foreign missions in Paris . . . . . . 200 \" \rCongregation of the Holy Spirit . . . . . . . . . . 150 \" \rReligious establishments of the Holy Land . . . . . 100 \" \rCharitable maternity societies . . . . . . . . . . 300 \" \rExtra, for that of Arles . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 \" \rWork for the amelioration of prisons . . . . . . . 400 \" \rWork for the relief and delivery of prisoners . . . 500 \" \rTo liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt 1,000 \" \rAddition to the salary of the poor teachers of thediocese . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,000 \" \rPublic granary of the Hautes-Alpes . . . . . . . . 100 \" \rCongregation of the ladies of D----, of Manosque, and of Sisteron, for the gratuitous instruction of poor girls . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,500 \" \rFor the poor . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6,000 \" \rMy personal expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,000 \" \rTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15,000 \"\r M. Myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied the see of D---- As has been seen, he called it regulating his household expenses.\rThis arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by Mademoiselle Baptistine.\rThis holy woman regarded Monseigneur of D---- as at one and the same time her brother and her bishop, her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the Church. She simply loved and venerated him.\rWhen he spoke, she bowed; when he acted, she yielded her adherence.\rTheir only servant, Madame Magloire, grumbled a little.\rIt will be observed that Monsieur the Bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres, which, added to the pension of Mademoiselle Baptistine, made fifteen hundred francs a year.\rOn these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted.\rAnd when a village curate came to D----, the Bishop still found means to entertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, and to the intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine.\rOne day, after he had been in D---- about three months, the Bishop said:--\r\"And still I am quite cramped with it all!\"\r\"I should think so!\" exclaimed Madame Magloire.\r\"Monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town, and for his journeys about the diocese.\rIt was customary for bishops in former days.\"\r\"Hold!\" cried the Bishop, \"you are quite right, Madame Magloire.\"\rAnd he made his demand.\rSome time afterwards the General Council took this demand under consideration, and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs, under this heading:\rAllowance to M. the Bishop for expenses of carriage, expenses of posting, and expenses of pastoral visits.\rThis provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senator of the Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundred which favored the 18 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of D----, wrote to M. Bigot de Preameneu, the minister of public worship, a very angry and confidential note on the subject, from which we extract these authentic lines:--\r \"Expenses of carriage?\rWhat can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants?\rExpenses of journeys?\rWhat is the use of these trips, in the first place?\rNext, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts?\rThere are no roads. No one travels otherwise than on horseback.\rEven the bridge between Durance and Chateau-Arnoux can barely support ox-teams. These priests are all thus, greedy and avaricious.\rThis man played the good priest when he first came.\rNow he does like the rest; he must have a carriage and a posting-chaise, he must have luxuries, like the bishops of the olden days.\rOh, all this priesthood! Things will not go well, M. le Comte, until the Emperor has freed us from these black-capped rascals.\rDown with the Pope!\r[Matters were getting embroiled with Rome.] For my part, I am for Caesar alone.\" Etc., etc.\r On the other hand, this affair afforded great delight to Madame Magloire. \"Good,\" said she to Mademoiselle Baptistine; \"Monseigneur began with other people, but he has had to wind up with himself, after all. He has regulated all his charities.\rNow here are three thousand francs for us!\rAt last!\"\rThat same evening the Bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a memorandum conceived in the following terms:--\rEXPENSES OF CARRIAGE AND CIRCUIT.\rFor furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital. 1,500 livres \rFor the maternity charitable society of Aix . . . . . . . 250 \" \rFor the maternity charitable society of Draguignan . . . 250 \" \rFor foundlings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500 \" \rFor orphans . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500 \" \rTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,000 \"\r Such was M. Myriel's budget.\rAs for the chance episcopal perquisites, the fees for marriage bans, dispensations, private baptisms, sermons, benedictions, of churches or chapels, marriages, etc., the Bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity, since he bestowed them on the needy.\rAfter a time, offerings of money flowed in.\rThose who had and those who lacked knocked at M. Myriel's door,--the latter in search of the alms which the former came to deposit.\rIn less than a year the Bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress.\rConsiderable sums of money passed through his hands, but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life, or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities.\rFar from it.\rAs there is always more wretchedness below than there is brotherhood above, all was given away, so to speak, before it was received.\rIt was like water on dry soil; no matter how much money he received, he never had any.\rThen he stripped himself.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646490, "end": 1639905690, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905713, "snapshot": "1639646490", "state": "closed", "author": "0xCb9Bd1D87C0AEe002691aB7dec4Ba1b893B6e133", "space": {"id": "apql.eth", "name": "apql"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
