We will follow their example, and will also call him thus when we have occasion to name him.\rMoreover, this appellation pleased him.\r\"I like that name,\" said he.\r\"Bienvenu makes up for the Monseigneur.\"\rWe do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable; we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER III \rA HARD BISHOPRIC FOR A GOOD BISHOP\r The Bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms.\rThe diocese of D---- is a fatiguing one. There are very few plains and a great many mountains; hardly any roads, as we have just seen; thirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, and two hundred and eighty-five auxiliary chapels.\rTo visit all these is quite a task.\rThe Bishop managed to do it.\rHe went on foot when it was in the neighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, and on a donkey in the mountains.\rThe two old women accompanied him. When the trip was too hard for them, he went alone.\rOne day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal city. He was mounted on an ass.\rHis purse, which was very dry at that moment, did not permit him any other equipage.\rThe mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town, and watched him dismount from his ass, with scandalized eyes.\rSome of the citizens were laughing around him.\r\"Monsieur the Mayor,\" said the Bishop, \"and Messieurs Citizens, I perceive that I shock you.\rYou think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by Jesus Christ.\rHere and there he halted, accosted the little boys and girls, and smiled upon the mothers.\rHe visited the poor so long as he had any money; when he no longer had any, he visited the rich.\rAs he made his cassocks last a long while, and did not wish to have it noticed, he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak.\rThis inconvenienced him somewhat in summer.\rOn his return, he dined.\rThe dinner resembled his breakfast.\rAt half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister, Madame Magloire standing behind them and serving them at table. Nothing could be more frugal than this repast.\rIf, however, the Bishop had one of his cures to supper, Madame Magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve Monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake, or with some fine game from the mountains.\rEvery cure furnished the pretext for a good meal:\rthe Bishop did not interfere. With that exception, his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water, and oil soup.\rThus it was said in the town, when the Bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cure, he indulges in the cheer of a trappist.\rAfter supper he conversed for half an hour with Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire; then he retired to his own room and set to writing, sometimes on loose sheets, and again on the margin of some folio. He was a man of letters and rather learned.\rHe left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts; among others, a dissertation on this verse in Genesis, In the beginning, the spirit of God floated upon the waters.\rWith this verse he compares three texts: the Arabic verse which says, The winds of God blew; Flavius Josephus who says, A wind from above was precipitated upon the earth; and finally, the Chaldaic paraphrase of Onkelos, which renders it, A wind coming from God blew upon the face of the waters. In another dissertation, he examines the theological works of Hugo, Bishop of Ptolemais, great-grand-uncle to the writer of this book, and establishes the fact, that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works published during the last century, under the pseudonym of Barleycourt.\rSometimes, in the midst of his reading, no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand, he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation, whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself.\rThese lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them.\r\"Let us announce our Te Deum from the pulpit, nevertheless, Monsieur le Cure.\rThings will arrange themselves.\"\rThey instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood. All the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly.\rWhile they were thus embarrassed, a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the Bishop, by two unknown horsemen, who departed on the instant.\rThe chest was opened; it contained a cope of cloth of gold, a mitre ornamented with diamonds, an archbishop's cross, a magnificent crosier,--all the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of Notre Dame d'Embrun. In the chest was a paper, on which these words were written, \"From Cravatte to Monseigneur Bienvenu.\"\r\"Did not I say that things would come right of themselves?\" said the Bishop.\rThen he added, with a smile, \"To him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop.\"\r\"Monseigneur,\" murmured the cure, throwing back his head with a smile. \"God--or the Devil.\"\rThe Bishop looked steadily at the cure, and repeated with authority, \"God!\"\rWhen he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity, all along the road.\rAt the priest's house in Chastelar he rejoined Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire, who were waiting for him, and he said to his sister:\r\"Well! was I in the right?\rThe poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands, and he returns from them with his hands full. I set out bearing only my faith in God; I have brought back the treasure of a cathedral.\"\rThat evening, before he went to bed, he said again:\r\"Let us never fear robbers nor murderers.\rThose are dangers from without, petty dangers.\rLet us fear ourselves.\rPrejudices are the real robbers; vices are the real murderers.\rThe great dangers lie within ourselves. What matters it what threatens our head or our purse!\rLet us think only of that which threatens our soul.\"\rThen, turning to his sister:\r\"Sister, never a precaution on the part of the priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, God permits.\rLet us confine ourselves to prayer, when we think that a danger is approaching us.\rLet us pray, not for ourselves, but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account.\"\rHowever, such incidents were rare in his life.\rWe relate those of which we know; but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at the same moment.\rOne month of his year resembled one hour of his day.\rAs to what became of \"the treasure\" of the cathedral of Embrun, we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction. It consisted of very handsome things, very tempting things, and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate.\rStolen they had already been elsewhere. Half of the adventure was completed; it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor.\rHowever, we make no assertions on this point.\rOnly, a rather obscure note was found among the Bishop's papers, which may bear some relation to this matter, and which is couched in these terms, \"The question is, to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital.\"\r\r\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646552, "end": 1639905752, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905771, "snapshot": "1639646552", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4024f233e51Ad6DC06715117A7a2F227fBE58659", "space": {"id": "apql.eth", "name": "apql"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
