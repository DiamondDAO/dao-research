A wood fire was burning there.\rOne can easily picture to one's self these two women, both of whom were over sixty years of age.\rMadame Magloire small, plump, vivacious; Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller than her brother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of 1806, which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which had lasted ever since.\rTo borrow vulgar phrases, which possess the merit of giving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly suffice to express, Madame Magloire had the air of a peasant, and Mademoiselle Baptistine that of a lady. Madame Magloire wore a white quilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck, the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, a very white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff, with large, short sleeves, an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks, knotted round the waist with a green ribbon, with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins at the upper corners, coarse shoes on her feet, and yellow stockings, like the women of Marseilles.\rMademoiselle Baptistine's gown was cut on the patterns of 1806, with a short waist, a narrow, sheath-like skirt, puffed sleeves, with flaps and buttons. She concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig. Madame Magloire had an intelligent, vivacious, and kindly air; the two corners of her mouth unequally raised, and her upper lip, which was larger than the lower, imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious look.\rI learned in the galleys. There is a school there for those who choose to learn.\rHold, this is what they put on this passport:\r`Jean Valjean, discharged convict, native of'--that is nothing to you--`has been nineteen years in the galleys:\rfive years for house-breaking and burglary; fourteen years for having attempted to escape on four occasions. He is a very dangerous man.'\rThere!\rEvery one has cast me out. Are you willing to receive me?\rIs this an inn?\rWill you give me something to eat and a bed?\rHave you a stable?\"\r\"Madame Magloire,\" said the Bishop, \"you will put white sheets on the bed in the alcove.\"\rWe have already explained the character of the two women's obedience.\rMadame Magloire retired to execute these orders.\rThe Bishop turned to the man.\r\"Sit down, sir, and warm yourself.\rWe are going to sup in a few moments, and your bed will be prepared while you are supping.\"\rAt this point the man suddenly comprehended.\rThe expression of his face, up to that time sombre and harsh, bore the imprint of stupefaction, of doubt, of joy, and became extraordinary. He began stammering like a crazy man:--\r\"Really?\rWhat!\rYou will keep me?\rYou do not drive me forth? A convict!\rYou call me sir!\rYou do not address me as thou? `Get out of here, you dog!' is what people always say to me.\rI felt sure that you would expel me, so I told you at once who I am.\rOh, what a good woman that was who directed me hither!\rI am going to sup! A bed with a mattress and sheets, like the rest of the world! a bed! It is nineteen years since I have slept in a bed!\rYou actually do not want me to go!\rYou are good people.\rBesides, I have money. I will pay well.\rPardon me, monsieur the inn-keeper, but what is your name?\rI will pay anything you ask.\rYou are a fine man. You are an inn-keeper, are you not?\"\r\"I am,\" replied the Bishop, \"a priest who lives here.\"\r\"A priest!\" said the man.\r\"Oh, what a fine priest!\rThen you are not going to demand any money of me?\rYou are the cure, are you not? the cure of this big church?\rWell!\rI am a fool, truly! I had not perceived your skull-cap.\"\rAs he spoke, he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner, replaced his passport in his pocket, and seated himself. Mademoiselle Baptistine gazed mildly at him.\rHe continued:\r\"You are humane, Monsieur le Cure; you have not scorned me. A good priest is a very good thing.\rThen you do not require me to pay?\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646776, "end": 1639905976, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905982, "snapshot": "1639646776", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB57C5F435e78E0668F6EBC1CFC2d0ff653ff720d", "space": {"id": "apql.eth", "name": "apql"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
