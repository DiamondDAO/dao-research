There is incoming utility for their token $volt and the supply shock is going to be very real! \n\n\"What is $Volt?  $Volt is a utility token with the \n@RealSupDucks\n eco. Every day 100k $volt is added (10 per supduck)\n\nAs king frog + ingredient utility rolls out shortly, frog owners can use $volt to purchase ingredients to upgrade to a limited supply of animated frogs (10,600/20k total frogs) and 1k mega fat toadz \n\nTotal supply according to coin gecko: 3,035,910 as of October 25th. With no burn supply would be 6,035,910 on November 24\n\nThis is the supply shock! As you can see the cost and supply of each ingredient:\n\nGummy worms 500*7500 = 3,750,000\nIce cream 1000*2500 = 2,500,000\nVolt cola 2500*500 = 1,250,000\nBlue chili flys 5000*100 = 500,000\n\n8 million $volt. Yet only 6mil will exist in 30 days.\"", "choices": ["Purchase SupDucks", "Purchase SupDucks + KingFrogs", "No"], "start": 1635271200, "end": 1635357600, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 2, 1], "scores_total": 3, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1636759696, "snapshot": "13490193", "state": "closed", "author": "0xA4E131A22DF699e6b3EE2933B614bD75457f6bd7", "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth", "name": "Head Dao"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYgw8Qt3KEKk37KTVnrRSVszzaTDPKPfDu87XXMkvZ4ZU", "voter": "0x0f271dfEE34c00D9C117EbD0360547101A52d6d6", "created": 1635350310, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdxwEXXoW58ep2C3KjxTUmY2AjAP8uMZ7B2zjTQYTuc6w", "voter": "0x2C16f1bF36062EA270B8E27eE48D74FEEFD16e82", "created": 1635271773, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}]}
