IF we were to put at least 100ETH into the T- STETH-C call vault, we would get between 10-30% APY (including the stETH growth) \n\nThe option to put 200ETH is to warrant the gas cost further, but will not have any change on the benefits outlined below.\n\nThere might be quantity loss, but the call premiums would likely make up for this in the short term. Call options only run for 1 week, so this reduced the change of them going Into The Money a fair bit. \n\nI think this is a risk worth taking for the marketing. \n\nNOTE: For those that check, the t-STETH-C vault is currently full, but this will change this week when they increase the allowances\n\nRibbon will \n\ud83c\udf80RT our announcement. \n\ud83c\udf80Add us to a blog post in production of \"Treasuries that Vault with RIbbon\"\n\ud83c\udf80Produce the above blog as a Twitter \ud83e\uddf5\n\ud83c\udf80Consider a \"Partners\" section on their homepage.", "choices": ["For - 100 ETH in", "Against - No ETH in", "For - Increase to 200 ETH "], "start": 1638262800, "end": 1638417600, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [11, 0, 3], "scores_total": 14, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638417629, "snapshot": "13713860", "state": "closed", "author": "0x66Ce6cEa1C23bF0694828D65Fa536ceF727E07d3", "space": {"id": "shoal.eth", "name": "SQUID DAO"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x991abdcc8a45c414a0d68e0256d93008a8d83349a4a9230ce2bc99caa1ef6c5a", "voter": "0x6665a5A00ef3388328cB0713c008099e3E7B7092", "created": 1638409378, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0x40bdc57486005c9794082ec5c2def0aa94011f5cae818d9dd884f76129148166", "voter": "0x870C66e74c6691894b3718Fd51216E8940197504", "created": 1638409350, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0xbd026bfd49496d1d9145fa8ea78c56ed4f9a7245cad99edbb4bb053e73bdf090", "voter": "0x0F45156F109e474295913D78036FA213b1745D5A", "created": 1638403724, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0xa1c8adb0230ee74f652c6869547db19017ae0113984f61d455e048f50d9e3f96", "voter": "0xe3C811c3508EdD755BF3AE63A0A937EE604B6f44", "created": 1638325989, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf8Y8LZVtZF6T5zQTZZcYSWjfkbhjCNE5iVs3RwzeSTC8", "voter": "0xF6f6d531ed0f7fa18cae2C73b21aa853c765c4d8", "created": 1638325833, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaimVB4Z5XXj6U2g6fgTKMsqrZ9gzmNfAh4rjYP3faVqt", "voter": "0x205b993Bb19930C80FB10ddF4f4c423e49c4cAAC", "created": 1638318860, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0x72aa83945a216b8df0958ccda13f8f1777227425056e4091dbf2d961cc959bd5", "voter": "0x7532A9E3e9475337c8A907428E35932A20959FDf", "created": 1638281993, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc55b8265802ec182b1eb1cedb80598f74f2ee1417811cd5226be728d17db2f4b", "voter": "0x68b2dEB1564F60f9c8224848293A39c49dF721E1", "created": 1638279672, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0x8d81e1d1fa96884ae0300537f3b909e264bc60d0f6b6df666bba1b9b60ad2d6e", "voter": "0xe6a6eE4196D361ec4F6D587C7EbE20C50667fB39", "created": 1638270982, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ6Ye5Jvmxyj4o219KofvZSdLTg8K8SsUHZyzsSLU95im", "voter": "0x4B1e684d5143eb7435E5D78385FA8cbdCcD8f7EC", "created": 1638263378, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}]}
