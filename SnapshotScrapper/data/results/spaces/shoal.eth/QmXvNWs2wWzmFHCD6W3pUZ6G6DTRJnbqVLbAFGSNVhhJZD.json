{"id": "QmXvNWs2wWzmFHCD6W3pUZ6G6DTRJnbqVLbAFGSNVhhJZD", "title": "Squid/OHM LP Proposal", "body": "Migrate 33% of SQUID/ETH liquidity to SQUID/OHM\n\nIn an effort to further improve SquidDAO\u2019s fundamentals, as well as strengthen our partnership with OlympusDAO, we are proposing that we migrate 33% of our liquidity to SQUID/OHM.\n\nThe basic idea is the following:\n- remove 33% of the SQUID/ETH Sushiwap liquidity\n- move the ETH to the treasury\n- borrow OHM matching the amount of removed ETH from OlympusDAO\n- pair it with SQUID from the removed liquidity to create a SQUID/OHM pool\n\nThe end result is 33% of the current liquidity will be SQUID/OHM and 67% \u2013 in SQUID/ETH. While our treasury value and runway get boosted.\n\nThe exact mechanics of the liquidity swap will be outlined separately following an approval of thai proposal from SquidDAO and a corresponding approval of the loan and its terms from OlympusDAO. \n\nIn order to continue thickening out liquidity as the protocol grows, we will be accepting both SQUID/OHM and SQUID/ETH bonds. The amount of SQUID/OHM to be minted against these bonds will be a conservative % to be decided by a separate Snapshot vote, should this proposal be approved. The policy team will be tasked with managing the capacity of SQUID/ETH and SQUID/OHM bonds.\n\nLoan Terms & Repayment\nOlympus will supply the OHM required to match our SQUID pool. This will be structured as a rev share with an expiration.  The total value of the loan will be based on a spot price of OHM when the pool is formed. \n\nWe will repay/share revenue with Olympus by taking a 3.3% of the new bonding fees from the OHM bond and SQUID/OHM bond. \n\nEach payment will  consist of a blend of assets (33% SQUID, 33% ETH, 33% OHM or gOHM).\n\nThe loan will expire and be due for payment in 5 years if we have not repaid the entire balance prior to that. \n\nWe will  sunset the rev share on bonds after 5 yrs or after we have paid 2x the balance. Whichever comes first. \n\nPros:\n- Strengthens our partnership with OlympusDAO\n- Gives our treasury a serious ETH injection -- we currently have over 3200 ETH sitting in the LP, 33% of which will be migrated to our treasury and can be deployed for additional yield farming strategies\n- Increases our RFV because the ETH is no longer discounted as it is while sitting in the LP\n- Improves all other metrics derived from RFV, such as runway and backing of circulating SQUID\n- Arbitrage opportunities b/n the two pools increase our LP fees\n", "choices": ["Move 33% of our LP to OHM/SQUID ", "Don't do deal with OLYMPUS "], "start": 1638975600, "end": 1639162800, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [17, 1], "scores_total": 18, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1639162820, "snapshot": "13765679", "state": "closed", "author": "0xF94241bAa46171b724eD535314963B45F84c9F16", "space": {"id": "shoal.eth", "name": "SQUID DAO"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xe3c72440f7ef84d6f311c96857d84c752c5228d53c6012fa9beb672f5e9ac876", "voter": "0x6665a5A00ef3388328cB0713c008099e3E7B7092", "created": 1639025330, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb7885707792481dc3cf03456a55412c25e6bae69c3a563e30463dc27602919fb", "voter": "0x870C66e74c6691894b3718Fd51216E8940197504", "created": 1639025315, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0xfa4443ab47f4422aa77d875414869581db1f0c587132df09c1ab6aa1f4709681", "voter": "0x0393a59Ff70D4563d9700EdfbaF7648b5e72Bc11", "created": 1639021223, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0x98977c3a58dff9eaa4dcd36e032e361a65278689f6524471dc8ac337766dd8b9", "voter": "0xEA9E9ae3BD4A7F771Eec5193C0498f90fE2D53E3", "created": 1639006116, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc62e26ab583c34881e25a4b6e80c1ed9006cd4ba3ea1724a9d8ba6075ddf62f2", "voter": "0xF6f6d531ed0f7fa18cae2C73b21aa853c765c4d8", "created": 1639001678, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe71b425d7b30cdae71ff18a77cbd270a1bd496d1ee10e273e5c11ebc3fb4f3d2", "voter": "0x2D23b731e5F04996A2Dfdbe434c7D922aFdb5E00", "created": 1638986613, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe91e4e37625c124ab82dd03e59d266e8a73a3fc0e27c54de662d923ea03f7a33", "voter": "0xbd2670D4253103eFD9272eAd153b0cE82182F3e5", "created": 1638981718, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0xdeb99db7d966054598ab517f21f4b35684fa454011348c09252c3df80329393f", "voter": "0x68b2dEB1564F60f9c8224848293A39c49dF721E1", "created": 1638981702, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0x5a2a7a75363b108a63eac042f0b56184deced44a7838a493444b0ce8e38462f3", "voter": "0x512E3Eb472D53Df71Db0252cb8dccD25cd05E9e9", "created": 1638981606, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0x875e3fb406c5b0a412f7306228fceb3bebaafdadae39506a39119372b5bdfe15", "voter": "0x205b993Bb19930C80FB10ddF4f4c423e49c4cAAC", "created": 1638979149, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}]}
