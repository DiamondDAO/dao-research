LUSD can go in via liquidty \n2. LUSD can go in via BProtocol and gain, RT or our T,  announce this to B.Pro community, and an ask of Liquity to do the same\n3. LUSD can go in via Pickle for fully hands off. Same B.Pro marketing.. and I will talk to Larry the Cucumber to get Pickle to tweet.\n\n---------------OVERVIEW\n\nBPro provides a  backstop for protocols that need liquidations.\nOne of the projects they are partnered with is Liquity (LUSD) \n\nSquid could:\nUse ETH on Liquity to mint LUSD (say, 35% of the value)\n(this will be a CDP and will require monitoring to avoid liquidation)\n\nThe borrowed LUSD can be put into Liquity's Stability Pool (SP) to provide LUSD for their internal liquidation process.\n\nLUSD in the SP will earn $LQTY at around 15% depending on market conditions.\n\n---------------HOWEVER\n\n1. LUSD can go in via Liquity \n(This will require harvesting of LQTY and ETH earned from our LUSD being used to liquidate positions.)\n\n2. LUSD can go in via B.Protocol and gain, a retweet of our announcement tweet, announce this to B.Pro community, and an ask of Liquity to do the same.\n(This will autocompound the ETH earned so that it is used to earn more LQTY. LQTY will need to be manually harvested)\n\n3. LUSD can go in via Pickle for fully hands off. Same B.Pro marketing.. and wen can talk to Larry the Cucumber to get Pickle to tweet.\n(This will be fully autocompounding the LUSD)\n\n---------------UNWIND\n\nWe can use any LQTY to purchase more ETH\nWe can use any excess LUSD to purchase more ETH\n\n---------------BONUS\n\nCRE8R DAO would:\nThis proposal was brought by Ceazor. His marketing DAO has a relationship with B.Pro and if choice 2 or 3 are chosen. His DAO will produce some marketing content regarding this collaboration.\n\n---------------HOW MUCH ETH\nAssuming ETH = $4114.82\nAssuming we borrow 35% of the value\n\nIF we put ----we have LUSD farming\n\n100ETH----$144,018.70\n200ETH----$288,037.40\n300ETH----$432,056.10\n\n", "choices": ["Liquity", "B.Pro", "Pickle", "Don't do any of this"], "start": 1638590400, "end": 1638849600, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [2, 0, 3, 0], "scores_total": 5, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638849655, "snapshot": "13738042", "state": "closed", "author": "0x66Ce6cEa1C23bF0694828D65Fa536ceF727E07d3", "space": {"id": "shoal.eth", "name": "SQUID DAO"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xd489fa53e19abbb9e2f6ee90c62a17126dbbe6fc2996be0aabdc0a13f1978d31", "voter": "0x7532A9E3e9475337c8A907428E35932A20959FDf", "created": 1638829246, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0x5eb7f1a571c7297bf2f6054cc8d4e1318f27662091dc802820dcee319e516d02", "voter": "0x0F45156F109e474295913D78036FA213b1745D5A", "created": 1638821530, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1c91021534be7b8e01809eaccd50e07f83aa5d4f2e4b48e7d9ae144fdac34bdb", "voter": "0xe0842049837F79732d688d0d080aCee30b93578B", "created": 1638781822, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0x298436bb22f5d3f7de32d110fc947ec32666fec33b48dddca9c1492238f1a0e2", "voter": "0x99422bA6714DdF2210f4ddE38f0cA882cAf757d3", "created": 1638752739, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}, {"id": "0x21a33d4895d8542ef19634d10857f446d102c070596143bf88535372e55d4948", "voter": "0x205b993Bb19930C80FB10ddF4f4c423e49c4cAAC", "created": 1638607555, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "shoal.eth"}}]}
