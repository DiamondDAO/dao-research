During that time, I\u2019ve acquired the skillset of \u201ctasteful\u201d outreach (so initiating conversations in a \u201cnon-salesy\u201d way, crucial for crypto I believe), setting & holding prospects accountable to timelines, getting the feedback back to the team and just overall business development acumen. In addition to that, I\u2019ve been familiar with the space since 2017 and know the \u201cins & outs\u201d of our culture. Working \u201cpart-time\u201d for the DAO is my dabble into the crypto space as a \u201cjob\u201d and I fully intend to go full-time as time goes on.\n\nUseful links/ Contact information\nEmail: andreas@rarible.org\n\nDiscord: Kinempor#3346\n\nThe first scope of my engagement will be primarily helping build the Biz-Dev team and starting to professionalize the outreach. This will change as needed as it is a work-in-progress.\n\n\nIn total, the approx. hours spent per week will amount to up 30h (min. 25h) & my ask is 6500$ per month in RARI token as per the outlined compensation guidelines here:\n\nPayments shall be made to this address:\n0x15cCF9e7c5C5BE7F4B929BF2651768fE5692E12c\n\nAccountability\nOnce certain reportings/dashboards are set-up (in progress), I will track everything accordingly to provide full visibility. I will attend all weekly biz-dev calls & other calls as needed. I will be available full time for any meetings or discussions (urgent or scheduled) as a business development spokesperson, in respects of my timezone (CEST).", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1635764400, "end": 1636110000, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [1, 0], "scores_total": 1, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1636760028, "snapshot": "20861015", "state": "closed", "author": "0x15cCF9e7c5C5BE7F4B929BF2651768fE5692E12c", "space": {"id": "r-wave.eth", "name": "R Wave"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xe2b5ea51f7388fb21c4f5807b0550a44820bab16294ea4e2148af490602cef35", "voter": "0x4DAAc1943c42B5988629414af1c32936601E81ea", "created": 1636058605, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "r-wave.eth"}}]}
