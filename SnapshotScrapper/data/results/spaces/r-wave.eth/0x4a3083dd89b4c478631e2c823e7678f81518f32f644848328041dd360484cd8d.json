My goal will be to build out processes where none exist and improve our way of working as a DAO. I will be contributing a minimum of 10 hour/ week and will provide more support if needed without asking for an increased payment. \n\nI\u2019ve been a Management Consultant working in Operations and Implementation work for the last 5-6 years, where I helped manage and complete global projects with Fortune 500 companies. I can use that experience and rigour to ensure we work efficiently and improve our outputs.\n\nKey links:\n\nLinkedIN: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarmadahmad/\n\nResume: https://1drv.ms/b/s!Aj4sQx8lCyWdgadlFrYxcwS1QOXUnw?e=KnuVuu\n\nPaid to: greydient.eth (0x173a55e664c25986F7a2495998751A255793D1AB)", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1636570500, "end": 1637082000, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [2, 0], "scores_total": 2, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1637264895, "snapshot": "21218316", "state": "closed", "author": "0x173a55e664c25986F7a2495998751A255793D1AB", "space": {"id": "r-wave.eth", "name": "R Wave"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xf73ae011990c58ede108f4997db8330e049240588d6d2b12804f9d6a1aa05865", "voter": "0x8F0A77e8BefF450d060139309e33a59c220966B8", "created": 1636983686, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "r-wave.eth"}}, {"id": "0x806ebcdf17c9f824a569849fed209e60e503832e18fada3fc50dd0f7fc4e3a70", "voter": "0x4DAAc1943c42B5988629414af1c32936601E81ea", "created": 1636922495, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "r-wave.eth"}}]}
