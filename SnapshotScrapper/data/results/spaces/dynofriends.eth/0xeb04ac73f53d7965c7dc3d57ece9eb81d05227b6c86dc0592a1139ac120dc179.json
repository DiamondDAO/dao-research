Payment on Polygon would be WETH (MATIC token is also needed to pay gas). For BSC, users would only need BNB. Ethereum network fees remain the same. How payment is handled on other chains can be discussed if/when they are added.\n\nThe minter can also keep the Dynos in order regardless of which chain they are minted on. So, only 4,400 could be created across chains with no duplicates. So, for instance, once Dyno #500 is minted on Ethereum, you can't mint the same Dyno number on BSC, etc.\n\nThe rarity tool can be updated to display Dynos from all chains and even specify which chain they are on.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1635350400, "end": 1638032400, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [9, 0], "scores_total": 9, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638032413, "snapshot": "13501537", "state": "closed", "author": "0x00deD2FB5147046c7bC8f2CE4032aEcD028014CB", "space": {"id": "dynofriends.eth", "name": "Dyno Friends"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x1ff59c1118514de0fc1a9778f50bb5aa4a703d0f70c9eb0258d4f6d60a698422", "voter": "0x6287DaAbAB9697CbA4375Ab2E1ba543ca25245Da", "created": 1635391179, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dynofriends.eth"}}, {"id": "0xf9a4b6edb8052faed86dbd3eb1a0d54b0b8c68a5917c5af58d3642c6f950c8d7", "voter": "0x00deD2FB5147046c7bC8f2CE4032aEcD028014CB", "created": 1635367668, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dynofriends.eth"}}]}
