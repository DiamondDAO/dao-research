This is better than erasing old messages, or rewarding people who don't deserve to be rewarded.\n\nPlease vote.", "choices": ["Upgrade to New Discord", "Maintain Current Discord"], "start": 1637629200, "end": 1637974800, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1637974822, "snapshot": "13667479", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9ad33d2D173f224Aa3A2e71D77041EE353c69b32", "space": {"id": "numinouspark.eth", "name": "Numinous Park"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
