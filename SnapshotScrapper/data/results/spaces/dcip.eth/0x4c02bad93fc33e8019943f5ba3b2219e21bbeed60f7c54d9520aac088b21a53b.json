There are many entities and technical concepts involved that, together, enable what we consider a true innovation: Swap between crypto and conventional currency in a self-custodial and decentralized way.\n\nBut what makes Nimiq special is not only the ability to produce technological innovation. It's the ease of use that turns complicated tech into real-world value for everyday humans. And we're just getting started.\n\nSuper simple swaps\nToday, we are introducing a unique product made by Nimiq: a standalone service that aspires to be the easiest, fastest, safest, and most accessible way to buy and sell crypto. And on top of that, it'll be one of the cheapest as well. That's a lot of superlatives but we're absolutely convinced we have the tech and ability to deliver on each one. But before we get into them, let's first talk about the product.\n\nA signup-free web app that puts together Fastspot, TEN31 and Nimiq OASIS to enable the unique concept of a fiat smart contract as a single service: one that provides self-custodial atomic swaps between crypto and conventional currency. No additional wallet needs to be created to use the service: any existing wallet is supported. The service currently supports EUR, BTC, and NIM, with more currencies being added in the future.\n\nBy connecting the basic touch points of users with fiat and crypto \u2013 the bank account and the crypto wallet \u2013 this service removes intermediaries, cuts out the middlemen and avoids the costs and centralization that come with them.\n\nIn short, it will be a super simple way to swap fiat and crypto. That's why we call it SuperSimpleSwap\n    ", "choices": ["Disagree", "Allocate $ 40,000 USD", "Allocate $ 50,000 USD", "Allocate $ 60,000 USD"], "start": 1637151042, "end": 1637708400, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [39990224845325.45, 26946405303.028423, 0, 249168082734.80383], "scores_total": 40266339333363.29, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1637708429, "snapshot": "12722840", "state": "closed", "author": "0x0681b82E9270e8520E962861a7E214C416E69110", "space": {"id": "dcip.eth", "name": "DCIP"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x67bf58d816b763e985f8b1b7081db01a183a00f6049a2913aef30b2a5437224f", "voter": "0xDBE4De27969ccC2ED1d32DCd0279127B0e8Bc29d", "created": 1637361477, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0a2a794b3ecd2f0a255c9de88a74faee78832a8e9256c118fae2128a123e85bf", "voter": "0xFAa16751e656A6ceC68A8273A1134526Fb01cEca", "created": 1637175205, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xa74c985b18d18cbd9963fb11c71974f3dec3ae37605aa678c1b9034f98921327", "voter": "0x735fe38Ae2c43c1d680e4CD5E76097ab6d071574", "created": 1637168799, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe3baa39eba92b14e2ccfefea4db92b9c0c6125b364ffd1cc2a256499cb9bd1e7", "voter": "0xaaf8eece62C9F0d1f5D6528044da4c6e4d058a41", "created": 1637168308, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x42378475a44ef690a7982bcec00c80e8e90a1322b8f2afc68e5faad6ea12ab6c", "voter": "0x1e37dc3163d838342162dd2784126419566f133F", "created": 1637166618, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb4d5fb71adf2540e0657c5c396e30cdd64da8de33e71dc55ab6185bdc830c122", "voter": "0x41383cF67716478188D069Ac3c7df0cC706FDF54", "created": 1637166081, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xcd704d89b986f11068736ac25a2156cb0cc506eda0333e96d50670751f357f15", "voter": "0xA1432AaB7a3c406c812C281085dbb6EBfA763caB", "created": 1637162918, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x7470f20b84660ebea56d48a3064cf56788aef067c740898431e5aa53aa1ebcd3", "voter": "0x11C3B13d769F35Ffff7f96313094eC364f6119ba", "created": 1637161370, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xee62855567205595e83c05068d5049f0b6041a290af31f47a466e3178f8e03d6", "voter": "0xd1408008875bF38D842c8c3C311c0E9449e43072", "created": 1637157691, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x2b03f5c0f49c87770f3d845ca42704b3d311904ec1eb4c012db02941740a3f3f", "voter": "0xEab6F8748AFE99bDf1ec79D46E9B3bDD1b7a6990", "created": 1637157472, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1825000643ad61759fe0a423c20e83aba6613071f3b6c459e0043705d88df3bd", "voter": "0x8Bb4C2280eAb44D906BF637b45C831C805bA6948", "created": 1637154079, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb84f6129ff5f987f5575c2a185b6d2ce036fd61b650dd4519555662df758fc0c", "voter": "0x7c1C284A9673Aa3a47353e3cf6a5F69Aed781A76", "created": 1637153470, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x7b9bfc03d34a77a26ad7ebb5f5db94abfff4a7920c649e15989f8a51dd849171", "voter": "0x4e6A0406E70388F03972E877766E824c3d8C7361", "created": 1637152502, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0ef6ab1ff622d44a84b1e4e07a0f7ddf9001578bd4bf0827824a965e52e027bd", "voter": "0x5Bf49A3601Bc4c0af2b0D4A227eE6ea217758854", "created": 1637151594, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x3a57e6afeb2a2b9de74201e1b3fddac45a5fe07c3df08e4b1d550a2d4392e854", "voter": "0x0681b82E9270e8520E962861a7E214C416E69110", "created": 1637151451, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0746dd967e39279387744f328aea91b77cf01786cf48b91f668217e89c0a3ba3", "voter": "0x289f8DFcaAe2138a47B42969866e062cD06Bfffa", "created": 1637151168, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}]}
