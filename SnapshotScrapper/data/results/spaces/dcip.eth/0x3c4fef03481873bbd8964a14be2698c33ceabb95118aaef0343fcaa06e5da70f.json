The two most important features that set Elrond apart are Adaptive State Sharding and the Secure Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.\n\nElrond is a complete redesign of blockchain architecture with the aim to achieve global scalability and near instant transaction speed. Elrond's architecture rests on the following key innovations:\n\nAdaptive State Sharding on all levels: transaction, data and network. The dynamically adaptive sharding mechanism will perform shard merging and shard splitting while taking into consideration both the number of available validator nodes and also the network usage.\nSecure Proof of Stake Consensus, completed in just two communication steps, using modified Boneh\u2013Lynn\u2013Shacham (\"BLS\") multi-signatures among the validators of the consensus group. Moreover, nodes inside the shard are randomly selected for the consensus group with no possibility of knowing the group's composition more than one round in advance.\nHigh resiliency to malicious attacks due to periodical node reshuffling across shards. Every epoch, up to 1/3 of the nodes in every shard are reshuffled to other shards in order to prevent collusion.\nSecure randomness source with BLS signing, which makes it non-biasable and unpredictable.\nThe Arwen WASM VM, an exceptionally fast virtual machine for executing smart contracts written in any programming language that can compile to WebAssembly.\nSmart contracts on a sharded state architecture, with balanced load on shards. This is a requirement for a high-throughput blockchain platform. Balancing smart contracts across shards allows Elrond to run multiple SCs in parallel, while the cross-shard calls are handled by an asynchronous cross-shard execution process.\nFast finality for cross-shard transactions in mere seconds. Having a very high TPS is required for a high throughput blockchain solution, but TPS is only half the picture: fast finality for cross-shard transactions is of crucial importance. Most existing state-of-the-art blockchain architectures refuse to mention this aspect, but from a user standpoint it is extremely important. Fast cross-shard finality is naturally handled by Elrond at the protocol level, using a dispatching algorithm and a routing protocol.\n\nPossibility to creat APP on Elrond Network in 15 minutes.\nPartnership with more than 20 companies. (Crypto.com, Binance, Stake Capital, N Grave, CERE Network, Coinmerce, Nash , Shift, etc)\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThis project is longterm oriented and investing into such project, developing connections with Elrond, the ability of having our DCIP project on their network, possibility of stacking our coin, and being opened to hundred of thousands new big investors who could see the utility of our project is an extraordinary idea.\nTill this day, Elrond has a price of 339$ and it started around 5$ back in 2018-2019. With a supply not far of the one of Bitcoins and the Architecture of their blockchain, my predictions are that Elrond could reach 3000-4000$ by 2022-2023. \n\nFor more functionality of their project visit their Website, since there are so many projects they are working on.
