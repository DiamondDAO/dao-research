Details may be found at the following links:  https://ftx.com/en/tokens/BULL; and https://ftx.com/intl/tokens/ETHBULL.  BULL is an ERC20 token which seeks a return that corresponds to 3 times the daily return of Bitcoin. ETHBULL is an ERC20 token which seeks a return that corresponds to 3 times the daily return of Ethereum.\n\n### Functional details\n\nLeveraged tokens are ERC20 assets that provide for leveraged exposure to cryptocurrency markets, without the complications and related risk of directly managing a leveraged position.   The assets use leverage (debt) to achieve gains (or losses) several times higher than investing in the related currency directly.  For example, a 3X Leveraged BTC token (BULL) would generate 3x the returns compared to a direct investment in BTC.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the most established coins in the crypto space.  They are also the safest investments in the space as it is nearly certain that their values will continue to rise significantly over the medium and long term, as the pace of their adoption continues to accelerate.  Further, most of the reputable cryptocurrency analysts project significant upside in the short term as data from previous market cycles would indicate that the growth in both coins will accelerate as we approach this later stage of the bull market.  Many of these analysts project bitcoin growth of over 300% in coming months based on multiple models.  Many predict that Ethereum will exceed even the Bitcoin growth as it has in the last several years.\n\nBased on the status of the current investment proposals, it appears that we will make significant investments in both Bitcoin and Ethereum.  I believe this to be a wise investment decision.  I also believe that we can enhance the returns in our investments in both currencies by also purchasing the FTX Leveraged Tokens Bull and ETHBULL.\n\nI propose that we make a $50,000 investment allocated half to BULL (3X Leveraged BTC token) and half to ETHBULL (3X Leveraged Ethereum token).  When viewed collectively with the substantial investments we are making in BTC and ETH directly, this would result in overall positions that benefit from the safety (compared to other cryptocurrency investments) provided by Bitcoin and Ethereum, while providing for a blended return substantially in excess of returns generated by investing in the coins directly. If there is not sufficient liquidity to make these investments when approved, I propose that the investments would be made from the next funds added to the investment wallet. \n\n    ", "choices": ["Disagree", "Allocate $ 30,000 USD", "Allocate $ 50,000 USD", "Allocate $ 70,000 USD"], "start": 1637423804, "end": 1637989200, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [2535380087112.962, 81098872.9213706, 110751769039.14577, 144671384259.83673], "scores_total": 2790884339284.865, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1637989225, "snapshot": "12809745", "state": "closed", "author": "0x35d60A396672dFf5171becFfc59D4bFCb0FCb7Ab", "space": {"id": "dcip.eth", "name": "DCIP"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x7994aef7494a8fbd6f4796654a823c83732d1c476efab31a2acdab5c3bcabd8e", "voter": "0x7c4B106858538ec4cf5832c51cD1AB495F00b4Ce", "created": 1637985942, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x11ef86aa9e7c95cca178696a0d20ca63d072c73c335fb8acb1a2be24e69f8e05", "voter": "0xbc7197b46Ec6D319882EBb0649c82dAcf12fEB2b", "created": 1637928444, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x8269a8746334e45a0aa66013b9cc8c7934e4a505c156e1b74736877a1c82f149", "voter": "0x8c01955De31dB82f9A88BE01736D6Eac1b3eD23B", "created": 1637526192, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xbdd1cb21ac621c44a49920c00f5e8a6c2e5b8c544acf45bec7dacd3b988e8718", "voter": "0xaBB33c7E6c5E724eE8C7E59C9EfD56d13BEEF63F", "created": 1637515542, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc6b568aad41c0ad3f04daf080b19cbf37ad3d5385a0f676530ef5c6e5f1d6f96", "voter": "0xDBE4De27969ccC2ED1d32DCd0279127B0e8Bc29d", "created": 1637453586, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x20b61a52b27dd4e50668cfb8d6c6fbb6f573c171edcecf6596d32c4f6eda77be", "voter": "0xBA167B3B03C5353Ddca3f4A1982E826dd5D0cc5F", "created": 1637443514, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0bcf0e9c5ea8c0f44351acea17b4ebdf8008bed7b4b20fca66f3f9a6228be2e3", "voter": "0x8FCeEF19e6C8ce19d8F96487a7C540f3710f5811", "created": 1637442312, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x5c5e72090ae71a11aa0baf378064351d9504a7f723a596c2d37d2f4a632716be", "voter": "0x34cdB4bC650Eb34192e62629E365119cF48f25cc", "created": 1637441289, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x088d31620a1998a01642c48f840d1ef133f0d808f5e50d259b4a40940106eeb8", "voter": "0xA7F4aC6e547ed976452242Cb72a3977F943EC3D7", "created": 1637439584, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb9e14b49ede1ccfb107a27387fdce1410dc4014fbf60a42ee4430cd2328291f0", "voter": "0xBfb927fd2ceC1633E4f687025d1B205b066ad749", "created": 1637439366, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x7a159b2ef765d754e1fb3f02312ffd4fa6faa8c05b530fa18d62f506eb4d3eaa", "voter": "0xE1D7Ffc66ABb5E58928b189A8Ef19e0359dCAB03", "created": 1637434800, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xd03ec6eca9a9b46d968336b73f0adc963e9ee30dae61ef5ce0c7633a0f41b660", "voter": "0x9dB89Ced6C715c0b1667A6a787E327AA96d1c19B", "created": 1637427270, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xd4d53bb7144cd8093f22a16c0d8091ebffcfd6ab61ed616b8f2016202382e19d", "voter": "0x8E890e7d25a81555D6F69b0388275595fe73040E", "created": 1637427053, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x985769388d8ed80374a289b2486e44ff54ddda5446f393fe21d97438f50d0c2b", "voter": "0xa86fE74e11788eefEd77E2eD71b7f3baC82D9f79", "created": 1637427046, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xd19a35b5d58b44987182f7961c9a979178602d6246974a89a6813dd971cd2a90", "voter": "0x721130Ae9B94f91363A8bF2486361b58659D7649", "created": 1637424253, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x6de76c81d1978bd219f4e7e7d9925b27d7ecbf545f675bdbfb07cc92a475eef0", "voter": "0x35d60A396672dFf5171becFfc59D4bFCb0FCb7Ab", "created": 1637423997, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}]}
