TRL is their utility token which is used by their clients to pay for Triall's SaaS solutions.\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Triall (TRL)\n- **Token Address BEP-20:** 0xE2EB47954e821DC94e19013677004cD59Be0b17f\n- **Token Address ERC-20:** 0x58f9102bF53Cf186682Bd9a281d3Cd3c616eEc41\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://bit.ly/triallwp\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Proof of dox:** https://www.triall.io/\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Yes\n- **Proof of Audit:** http://bit.ly/3qYM6jT\n\n### Functional details\n\nThe clinical trials industry has a ~$200 billion annual expenditure and is struggling with inefficiencies, high cost, and excessive time use. Triall provides a Software as a Service solution to address these issues and will use blockchain solutions to allow different actors within a clinical trial to communicate between themselves, with their trial participants, and importantly, with regulatory authorities, to cut months or even years off of bringing new medicines to market.\n\nThe Triall team is fully doxed and consists of medical industry veterans. They are an established company in a highly regulated industry, making this a project with excellent integrity within the crypto space.\n\n175 million tokens were minted at launch. 2\u2009826\u2009479 unsold tokens were burned after the presale, leaving an approx 172M token total supply. Presale tokens were locked in 5-month, 12-month and 30-month vesting contracts which will lead to a slow trickle of tokens into the market over the next few years. The token launched on Uniswap at $0.25 and at time of writing is hovering around $0.5.\n\nMore token details here: https://insights.triall.io/triall-pre-sale-details-token-allocation/\n\nThe token started as ERC-20 on Ethereum and has since expanded to also have a BEP-20 token on BSC. There is a bridge between the networks for arbitrage etc. and this arrangement does not affect the token supply. The project is blockchain agnostic and will support whatever blockchain makes sense, both for its SaaS offerings and for the TRL token. The token may therefore become available on further blockchains in the future although no such concrete plans are known at the moment.\n\nTriall has been providing generous staking solutions for early holders of the token and have promised further staking pools going forward.\n\nThere is a 2.5% burn mechanism built into the use of the token in actual clinical trial projects. This will have a deflationary effect on the token over time.\n\nThe project team has held AMAs on telegram in the past and intend to continue doing so in future. Their tg is https://t.me/triallcommunity\n\nThe token is available on uniswap; pancakeswap; and the Liquid CEX, e.g. https://app.liquid.com/exchange/TRLUSDT\n\nFurther CEXes are planned in the future.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThis project is a poster child for industry adoption of crypto. It is run by a highly respected team of industry professionals in one of the most heavily regulated industries in the world. It is aiming to make inroads into the $200b/year clinical trials industry and capturing even a fraction of that will lead to huge gains to the token. This is a safe and stable investment for our fund, an easy hold for at least a 2-3 year period. From its current $0.5 value, even with the full 173M supply after vestment it is clear that a mere $86M token market cap is going to grow fast with even just moderate success in a $200b/year market.\n\nAlso, we'll be helping cure cancer even if very indirectly.\n\nWe should buy this token with a view to a long hold, and have a proactive policy of putting it into the staking pools that will open up over time.\n\nWe should buy it from whichever is the cheapest at the time, whether uniswap or pancakeswap.\n", "choices": ["Disagree", "Allocate $ 20,000 USD", "Allocate $ 100,000 USD", "Allocate $ 250,000 USD"], "start": 1637457849, "end": 1638054000, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [5556288406602.223, 164600300820.2471, 0, 108159735181.58447], "scores_total": 5829048442604.055, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638054012, "snapshot": "12820875", "state": "closed", "author": "0xDBE4De27969ccC2ED1d32DCd0279127B0e8Bc29d", "space": {"id": "dcip.eth", "name": "DCIP"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x315b7dcd96ff06447b913dc603aed8607e9a0cd7b3900dc83eec9cef217a6364", "voter": "0xad7A3A8F48e010b12E251ED51fCb182F194f4c2f", "created": 1637636655, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xd3ad0d2a0e16b9312949c7b7ca521251fc2bf5972e815ad8ad59e1dc2e83afcd", "voter": "0x5B3e5584Aa3b4a190B1Aa68168A61fD578F7325F", "created": 1637620009, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x812bfbdaba3327bdc30806facb14f40eca5da9fd21d8cc791d8f5f5e9fd5079c", "voter": "0xf2aA4312824fDbafCbd8D30d14Bde2282C1E8BB7", "created": 1637585878, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x13476004a45a4d9e2b621df0b9cbd44171edbe842f7f0cf0ed130b03c7e58633", "voter": "0x35d60A396672dFf5171becFfc59D4bFCb0FCb7Ab", "created": 1637577488, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe80f2c280324eaf66dc2b61bcc5c774c8749b9830eb8894bcf27572977b883a3", "voter": "0x8c01955De31dB82f9A88BE01736D6Eac1b3eD23B", "created": 1637525804, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x34be352c6cb5f9142858b811f0ff2c2e8676113125b579ed61f95e8c458fb7b7", "voter": "0x9bA78edB4292c2f20a6af8612a71297491383ac8", "created": 1637517415, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x5b5f380febfeb481d10125adcc1f8f4ed4d86a36d4fc3b8b040932b964ef1f49", "voter": "0x775907995658B5b1cE28b1440f4d707D8441A9E3", "created": 1637512532, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1b32ca6b13e3d9b48b49f8dad2f71cd7a62712c5848659c0a22e96c64f94474c", "voter": "0x72E3F7ded13576e83D0B4a415C0575b00ED0F2ba", "created": 1637493054, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb1416d2e3819c1774cb9357386afd1a07dd9cd7afb7a271e245ec850600c291b", "voter": "0x11C3B13d769F35Ffff7f96313094eC364f6119ba", "created": 1637490330, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb92a0d8830bfb8a0dcf454d651d094c0ffd5af71fb27316f15501105ec0ab6b7", "voter": "0xC20577A73567C5070dAa4035f7c8049a04A75b7d", "created": 1637471142, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0dd8c9b623ee390a8fa7e57250095ec34c36647e0243c5326ab823be27035354", "voter": "0x0d0a69E827B84D8eaC1AE5DB054a408671401779", "created": 1637465110, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb5d000ecc369dd7f2cca96faa97f7019e50616e1f47f3523c6eb0b602c6e6534", "voter": "0x4e6A0406E70388F03972E877766E824c3d8C7361", "created": 1637463667, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x3c22f6f954d8c2c06c412d35d1096ab3026c9648ddf10cbfd905efc2e1170fb4", "voter": "0x14A18BA4c3c13D5D424F38B06C16E09D54d0126a", "created": 1637463494, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1a778c3b7ae3e8b694d9227cc71657a7bd7f1c62e5309f65714f64cffb73c87a", "voter": "0xA1432AaB7a3c406c812C281085dbb6EBfA763caB", "created": 1637462180, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xd2768176ef67e51cace268c803440a238598d4d7d90e2a0f2f745adcc1cdc7e9", "voter": "0xF741af2b12A75Aa6F14830Ca8FF2c6A16Dfa7748", "created": 1637458912, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xefa25b4eeeaac568397188aead925e66995d19821fd7a1da809202d2a5e6eccb", "voter": "0xDBE4De27969ccC2ED1d32DCd0279127B0e8Bc29d", "created": 1637457880, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}]}
