The Helium Hotspot provides hundreds of square miles of connectivity and can transmit data at a fraction of the cost of a cellular network. Helium uses an open-source LongFi architecture, which combines the LoRaWAN wireless protocol and the Helium blockchain. Hotspots also acts as miners on the Helium blockchain so owners can earn a new cryptocurrency (HNT), for building the network and transferring IoT device data. Helium network is currently the largest growing network with over 70000 miners coming online every month, a total of 320,000 miners onboarded with over a million on order from different manufacturers. \n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nAnyone doubting the helium network should visit https://explorer.helium.com/hotspots look at their area(or any area in the world) and how many miners have been deployed thus far, as well as how much HNT each miner is earning. As of 11/17/2021, the current price of HNT is $44.38 (after a market-wide correction) which recently doubled after a deal between Helium and Dish Network. There is a proposal by the community to re-denominate HNT 1000/1 which will bring new new investors as well as reward hotspot owners with more HNT. The network is currently undergoing upgrades and it just so happens to coincide with a crypto market-wide correction. This is the absolute perfect time to invest in helium, during this dip and before the redenomination which will surely bring a myriad of new investors and increase its price even further. The redenomination will not affect the token's current market cap. There is an extremely large community backing this project, with thousands upon thousands of hotspot owners which would like to see this project succeed therefore, this project has a very low chance of failure as it currently stands. If you would like to read about the proposed redenomination please visit https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0039-hnt-redenomination.md . \nHelium, like Bitcoin halves exactly every two years and with the first halving already occurred on August 1, 2021 this means the token will become more scarce and the community will remain very interested in providing coverage to earn HNT. There is no doubt that the price of helium will continue to rise in the coming months and years. I'm willing to discuss with the community the perfect time for entry into this position, as the price may dip if the redenomination passes but then it will surelyskyrocket after that.\n    ",
