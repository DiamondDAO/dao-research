", "body": "\n**Proposal for:** Dusk Token \n\nDusk Network is a Level 0 KYC Blockchain designed to comply with government regulations for financial institutions, including CBDC, and other high-trust, high-privacy KYC environments such as online gambling, health care, insurance, legal, and government. Currently the project is ready to be introduced publicly in testnet form while behind the scenes Dusk is developing business connections which will legitimize the token even further.  \n\nhttps://dusk.network/pages/usecases\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Dusk Token - DUSK\n- **Token Address:** ERC-20 0x940a2db1b7008b6c776d4faaca729d6d4a4aa551 BEP-20\n- **Token Type:** Token \n- **Token Chain** Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain\n- **Stage:** Pre-Testnet Launch, February 1, 2022\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://dusk.network/uploads/dusk-whitepaperv2.pdf\n- **Team doxxed:** Huge team of researchers, developers, crytpographers, business leaders, and VC backing.\n- **Proof of dox:** https://dusk.network/pages/team\n- **Smart contract public:** https://github.com/dusk-network\n- **Audit:** Yes\n- **Proof of Audit:** Unavailable direct audit link but work is constantly audited throughout the development.\n- **LP Lock:** VC-backed Project with multiple exchange listings, millions in funding, over 8 million raised in seed, multiple locked liquidity pools on DeFi. No direct mention of locked liquidity but check link.\n- **LP Lock proof:** https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dusk-network/markets/\n\n### Functional details\n\nDusk Token is establishing itself as a dedicated network designed to accommodate the interests of very large key players in the global economy. The team and project were formulated from successful developers and venture capitalists and has turned into over 40 individuals responsible for expanding the adoption of Dusk within corporate and government functions.\n \nSome of the use cases include SEC compliant transactions allowing large hedge funds to do exactly what DCIP is doing but for us decentralized investors. It would allow for darkpools and even actual stock exchanges to be digitized to the blockchain. No other project of its caliber is able to match the team, roadmap, feature set, and contractual developments like Dusk. Per my research it seems that there are some major catalysts coming up regarding key businesses adopting the technology.\n\nAs they near deployment of their testnet on, February 1, 2022, the price of Dusk is touching and potentially surpassing ATH of .40. With a current market cap just 10x of DCIP, at $350M, there is still plenty of room to grow towards a 3.5b market cap which would be reached within the testnet phase and prior to mainnet launch. In addition staking the coin will net us 12% per year, doubling our initial investment in 6 years. My market cap prediction is based on its comparative token Zcash which is utilized for similar Snark-esque privacy features and has a 3.5b market cap currently. Their technology is underdeveloped as compared to Dusk and they do not have government and institutional features.\n\nWith at least a definite 10x, and with institutional contracts currently favorably under way, investing $60k should become at least $600k by mainnet, and with mainnet institutional players should become similar to Polkadot, Algorand, and other top coins which would be an even further 10x for $6m plus 12% of every year we staked until liquidation. This is highly doable per upcoming contractual announcements and test launch. \n\nStrategy: Currently the coin is pumping and recovering after hitting .4 prior to red week. We are looking at further growth as we get closer to the testnet launch. The plan is to hold past testnet and continuously monitor developments regarding mainnet and the contracts they have lined up. Market conditions will be continuously monitored and we may need to expect to liquidate the position during a black swan event if we are able to unlock the stake, which is locked for 30 days at a time. However in such a case I would urge we DCA instead depending on market conditions and insider information.\n", "choices": ["Disagree", "Allocate $ 40,000 USD", "Allocate $ 60,000 USD", "Allocate $
