The actual presale date will be announced on the 10th. There will now be 2 tokens, one of which is SatoshiSwap, the other is a surprise. Both will be distributed in equal amounts to everyone who takes part.\n> \n> _We'd like to remind everyone this is a community based project. SatoshiStreetBets has been built up to a thriving community of 750k degens across our different networks (Discord, Twitter, Telegram groups) and a pledge we are making is these tokens will be fully integrated and backed by the official SatoshiStreetBets platforms. You will see us pushing SatoshiSwap week-in week-out across all our platforms (Twitter, Telegram groups, Discord)... not just for the next few weeks, but for years to come. And over time we'll be continuously adding innovative new DeFi products to the protocol - we're actually already working on the second product right now._ \n> \n> **Schedule of events**\n> \n> 1. The SatoshiSwap website goes live December 10th. This will contain all of the necessary information for degens to do their due diligence, including everything you will possibly need to know about the presale event and more.\n> \n> 2. The whitelist dashboard website goes live December 10th. Everyone who wishes to take part in the presale token distribution event will need to complete a registration on the whitelist dashboard. As a core requirement to be whitelisted you will need to follow our Telegram and Twitter.\n> \n> 3. The presale event date will be announced on December 10th, the day the whitelist dashboard goes live.\n> \n> \n> 2 audits will be published in December, as will the whitepaper and roadmap.\n> \n> **There will now be 2 tokens**\n> \n> As the title suggests, there will be 2 completely separate tokens both backed by SatoshiStreetBets and both automatically distributed in equal amounts to everyone who takes part:\n> \n> **SatoshiSwap** - BSC token and a serious DeFi protocol\n> \n> **SecondToken** - ETH token. Absolutely not meant to be taken seriously. This is a pure YOLO move and is just for fun. Yes it's a meme token.\n> \n> \n> The SecondToken will not actually be called \"SecondToken\". To prevent copy cats stealing our ideas (wouldn't be the first time) we will be revealing it's name closer to launch. The website, graphics, whitepaper are all completed.\n> \n> \n> **Why have we made this move?**\n> \n> - We know our market and we know our community. For every seasoned DeFi wizard, there is a shitcoin connoisseur. For every yield farming pro, there's a veteran crayon-chewing monkey who only knows the meaning of two words: buy and HODL. So with 2 tokens we cater to the more serious investors and at the same time, with a good ole fashioned meme token, we cater to people who just ape in to a token with a meme on it\n> \n> - The presale will be held on ETH and then SatoshiSwap will be automatically transferred over to BSC. This leaves behind an \"empty\" ETH token anyway, so why not use it for something fun?\n> \n> - SSB has a strong meme-coin component to it's audience base. Hell, Doge is a core part of our history. So it makes sense to tap into that.\n> \n> **Anything else?**\n> \n> - Community members who follow our Twitter will be aware that we announced ownership of a SatoshiStreetBets trademark registration. This is a completed registration, not a pending application. In the weeks ahead we will be using this to enforce our rights against bad actors that have stolen our name and have been confusing people into buying fake tokens with our community name on it. This was a time consuming but necessary process and is why we're a couple of weeks behind schedule.\n> - We've been working on marketing plans, new hires and have a couple of surprises lined up for December to keep things exciting\n> - We're re-launching our Telegram groups very soon with some new rules\n> - As of the 10th this project comes out of \"stealth mode\" and we'll be ramping everything up big time\n> \n> See you guys all on the 10th!\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nIf we buy into the presale, we get equal amounts of both coins being made by SatoshiStreetBets; SatoshiSwap, and their meme coin. \n\nI know not much information is known, but honestly, SatoshiStreetBets has a large crypto influence just by name alone. Many DCIP investors found this project through SSB. SatoshiSwap sounds like it has potential, and if we can pass the proposal before the website goes live next week, we will be in a position to invest on the ground floor. \n\nI can understand any hesitation to back a project that has little information currently revealed. The main reason I didn\u2019t wait until next week to write the proposal is due to the potential time constraints of the voting system. If the presale is, for example, December 17, then making the proposal on December 10 would make it difficult to get in on the ground floor. \n\nSatoshiSwap is a long term investment with massive potential and a ton of social media influence.\n    ", "choices": ["Disagree", "Allocate $ 10,000 USD", "Allocate $ 20,000 USD", "Allocate $ 30,000 USD"], "start": 1638479054, "end": 1639026000,
