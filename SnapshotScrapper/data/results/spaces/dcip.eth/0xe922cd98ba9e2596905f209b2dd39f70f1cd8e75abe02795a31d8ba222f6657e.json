Launched in March 2019, the Theta mainnet operates as a decentralized network in which users share bandwidth and computing resources on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis.The project is advised by Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube and Justin Kan, co-founder of Twitch.\nTheta features its own native cryptocurrency token, THETA, which performs various governance tasks within the network, and counts Google, Binance, Blockchain ventures, Gumi, Sony Europe and Samsung as Enterprise validators, along with a Guardian network of thousands of community-run guardian nodes.\nDevelopers say that the project aims to shake up the video streaming industry in its current form \u2014 centralization, poor infrastructure and high costs mean that end users often end up with a poor experience. Content creators likewise earn less revenue due to the barriers between them and end users.\n\n### What Makes Theta Unique?\n\nTheta\u2019s main business concept is to decentralize video streaming, data delivery and edge computing, making it more efficient, cost-effective and fair for industry participants.\nThe network runs on a native blockchain, with two native tokens, known as Theta (THETA), Theta Fuel (TFUEL), powering the internal economy.\nTheta\u2019s appeal is threefold: viewers get rewarded with better quality streaming service, content creators improve their earnings and middlemen \u2014 video platforms \u2014 save money on building infrastructure and increase advertising and subscription revenues.\nUsers have an incentive to both watch network content and share network resources, as rewards come in the form of TFUEL tokens.\nThe platform is open source, and token holders receive governance powers as with many proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain ecosystems.\nIn addition to video, data and computing, Theta caters to developers looking to launch decentralized applications (DApps) on its fully featured EVM-compatible Smart contract platform.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThe current adoption of THETA is low. Currently one of the biggest costs are the infrastructure of the internet. With Theta global players like Google can massively reduce their costs. It is just a matter of time until adoption kicks in. Theta has already several patents to protect them from copycats. In the past month the price went sideways. At a certain point it has to go up.\n    ", "choices": ["Disagree", "Allocate $ 40,000 USD", "Allocate $ 70,000 USD", "Allocate $ 100,000 USD"], "start": 1637252256, "end": 1637794800, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [2380844177939.671, 22090941223.046333, 0, 338664220876.8347], "scores_total": 2741599340039.552, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1637794830, "snapshot": "12755059", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3db4d4085522D38d5faAbfdcC3aeC3597737baE5", "space": {"id": "dcip.eth", "name": "DCIP"}, "votes": 17, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x1782ff34d76f33a539267964e6e1ebe700999b96ae5eaa2be46608d0c86ef333", "voter": "0x40A561d5efCb14f260953B0dF6941911BcA6587F", "created": 1637365804, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x4f9023af62fae327f633024eec3caf88b280ba8b17a26310dcca94bc21e942be", "voter": "0x233509672fb7deAd7a7E2347EDf47820D21078Ba", "created": 1637362388, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0c58652c70ed710fb70183a8b8578816c981eabb6d3f51639ae8d7965828d0b6", "voter": "0xDBE4De27969ccC2ED1d32DCd0279127B0e8Bc29d", "created": 1637360316, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x12acf317c2027000e758daba39aa5dd1bd4feff79ec08231ee198920a5cf4d30", "voter": "0x6F64FE92ab4BE2e5Fc32C566C6c4A9A9CBC0A3AF", "created": 1637308097, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xecb2f99fe4fe40e35f56634febdba2d6148c595cdb4a0400a849cf5464b1427d", "voter": "0xcb9171Cb3136C31896c328925Fe6De9AD508D273", "created": 1637304456, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x84364e9b02a3d582106aa7a10a217abc79f1b66b4d5fa612696094d8e210678b", "voter": "0x4eeF7F341cdd2Be3456b01ddA935D7cc86370989", "created": 1637290919, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc25b25aced9efdc0082e255155f84543006c94d3cde4f762f96818663ecee70e", "voter": "0x35d60A396672dFf5171becFfc59D4bFCb0FCb7Ab", "created": 1637278779, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x2a574b180adafaacdfc5364c79deb18fe369fe41001737026462bfd2cb9e10fb", "voter": "0x11C3B13d769F35Ffff7f96313094eC364f6119ba", "created": 1637271765, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x175e13826b56ca68378cf3d52e199de9ab3b142b989d9ecf13e2028ba22f8e56", "voter": "0xFfe7B77F496A97aC9ef08f011dA4832F45B3000d", "created": 1637267360, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x549303ac224ed8748960f3b1337d64cf043eb7d417ac1a034e30299bdab92bdb", "voter": "0x41383cF67716478188D069Ac3c7df0cC706FDF54", "created": 1637263163, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x2ca1b97dbbd262f2f9beb7c1d9e220fa2cceb9d0fcc4a531ac02c6def5906ad9", "voter": "0x7A8CeD0717AaC2f1A77118e60A07bc1A2482b08A", "created": 1637260123, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x17af49968d977c9ccb03ef99fbe736ee02bd93e8c38d8b03528167c8dcb8857f", "voter": "0xd1408008875bF38D842c8c3C311c0E9449e43072", "created": 1637258970, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x2715dced880adc5de0c98d6d9d80763904b4e8a61267383eb851ad9e2e523880", "voter": "0xA1041201De9A19Dfa4dd2cF83Ca7eFb6304eac0f", "created": 1637258839, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xecbade1e2a18df764bab1d35a9c8d9e87ec77079847d2377dff9e88b533d291e", "voter": "0xc5ce020ef97ACA2F36054C993d11FA67Acf8bB3e", "created": 1637258048, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc8028381a6108532a1eace0dba9b30539ae0c57776ab3d12f84aa475ed99f26d", "voter": "0xF21494adfbf8D4332F540E3a819280eE5D22BB8F", "created": 1637257711, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x58d87f09b7ea182e77a1f651ce5990272d67397c9fb859ce59747600fc58473c", "voter": "0x0681b82E9270e8520E962861a7E214C416E69110", "created": 1637257060, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}, {"id": "0x91ba35cf87cc8d740effebefb71b2731f8c0c9ef4618b8eefb01a6627aaf2876", "voter": "0x3db4d4085522D38d5faAbfdcC3aeC3597737baE5", "created": 1637252273, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "dcip.eth"}}]}
