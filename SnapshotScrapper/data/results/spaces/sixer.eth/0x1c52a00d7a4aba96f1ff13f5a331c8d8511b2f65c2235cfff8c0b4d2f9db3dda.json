I am not in the world to guard my own life, but to guard souls.\"\rThey had to allow him to do as he pleased.\rHe set out, accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide.\rHis obstinacy was bruited about the country-side, and caused great consternation.\rHe would take neither his sister nor Madame Magloire.\rHe traversed the mountain on mule-back, encountered no one, and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his \"good friends,\" the shepherds. He remained there for a fortnight, preaching, administering the sacrament, teaching, exhorting.\rWhen the time of his departure approached, he resolved to chant a Te Deum pontifically.\rHe mentioned it to the cure.\rBut what was to be done?\rThere were no episcopal ornaments. They could only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy, with a few ancient chasubles of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace.\r\"Bah!\" said the Bishop.\r\"Let us announce our Te Deum from the pulpit, nevertheless, Monsieur le Cure.\rThings will arrange themselves.\"\rThey instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood. All the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly.\rWhile they were thus embarrassed, a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the Bishop, by two unknown horsemen, who departed on the instant.\rThe chest was opened; it contained a cope of cloth of gold, a mitre ornamented with diamonds, an archbishop's cross, a magnificent crosier,--all the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of Notre Dame d'Embrun. In the chest was a paper, on which these words were written, \"From Cravatte to Monseigneur Bienvenu.\"\r\"Did not I say that things would come right of themselves?\" said the Bishop.\rThen he added, with a smile, \"To him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop.\"\r\"Monseigneur,\" murmured the cure, throwing back his head with a smile. \"God--or the Devil.\"\rThe Bishop looked steadily at the cure, and repeated with authority, \"God!\"\rWhen he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity, all along the road.\rAt the priest's house in Chastelar he rejoined Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire, who were waiting for him, and he said to his sister:\r\"Well! was I in the right?\rThe poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands, and he returns from them with his hands full. I set out bearing only my faith in God; I have brought back the treasure of a cathedral.\"\rThat evening, before he went to bed, he said again:\r\"Let us never fear robbers nor murderers.\rThose are dangers from without, petty dangers.\rLet us fear ourselves.\rPrejudices are the real robbers; vices are the real murderers.\rThe great dangers lie within ourselves. What matters it what threatens our head or our purse!\rLet us think only of that which threatens our soul.\"\rThen, turning to his sister:\r\"Sister, never a precaution on the part of the priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, God permits.\rLet us confine ourselves to prayer, when we think that a danger is approaching us.\rLet us pray, not for ourselves, but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account.\"\rHowever, such incidents were rare in his life.\rWe relate those of which we know; but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at the same moment.\rOne month of his year resembled one hour of his day.\rAs to what became of \"the treasure\" of the cathedral of Embrun, we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction. It consisted of very handsome things, very tempting things, and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate.\rStolen they had already been elsewhere. Half of the adventure was completed; it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor.\rHowever, we make no assertions on this point.\rOnly, a rather obscure note was found among the Bishop's papers, which may bear some relation to this matter, and which is couched in these terms, \"The question is, to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital.\"\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639479772, "end": 1639738972, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639738992, "snapshot": "1639479772", "state": "closed", "author": "0xeDFE3520b5f3467b9Eb05e202C5A9Fc316A8e55F", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
