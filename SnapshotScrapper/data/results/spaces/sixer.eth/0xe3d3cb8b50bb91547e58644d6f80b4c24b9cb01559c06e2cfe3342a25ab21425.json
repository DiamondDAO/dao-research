WELCOME \rThe episcopal palace of D---- adjoins the hospital.\rThe episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone at the beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology of the Faculty of Paris, Abbe of Simore, who had been Bishop of D---- in 1712.\rThis palace was a genuine seignorial residence. Everything about it had a grand air,--the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms, the chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks encircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens planted with magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superb gallery which was situated on the ground-floor and opened on the gardens, M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, My Lords Charles Brulart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d'Embrun; Antoine de Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendome, Grand Prior of France, Abbe of Saint Honore de Lerins; Francois de Berton de Crillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; Cesar de Sabran de Forcalquier, bishop, Seignor of Glandeve; and Jean Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, preacher in ordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of Senez. The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment; and this memorable date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble.\rThe hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with a small garden.\rThree days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. The visit ended, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house.\r\"Monsieur the director of the hospital,\" said he to him, \"how many sick people have you at the present moment?\"\r\"Twenty-six, Monseigneur.\"\r\"That was the number which I counted,\" said the Bishop.\r\"The beds,\" pursued the director, \"are very much crowded against each other.\"\r\"That is what I observed.\"\r\"The halls are nothing but rooms, and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them.\"\r\"So it seems to me.\"\r\"And then, when there is a ray of sun, the garden is very small for the convalescents.\"\r\"That was what I said to myself.\"\r\"In case of epidemics,--we have had the typhus fever this year; we had the sweating sickness two years ago, and a hundred patients at times,--we know not what to do.\"\r\"That is the thought which occurred to me.\"\r\"I like that name,\" said he.\r\"Bienvenu makes up for the Monseigneur.\"\rWe do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable; we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original.\r\rThis, however, was a remark which was confined to the drawing-rooms. The populace, which perceives no jest in holy deeds, was touched, and admired him.\rAs for the Bishop, it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine, and it was a long time before he recovered from it.\rIn fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected and prepared, it has something about it which produces hallucination. One may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing upon it, from saying yes or no, so long as one has not seen a guillotine with one's own eyes: but if one encounters one of them, the shock is violent; one is forced to decide, and to take part for or against. Some admire it, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like Beccaria. The guillotine is the concretion of the law; it is called vindicte; it is not neutral, and it does not permit you to remain neutral. He who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers. All social problems erect their interrogation point around this chopping-knife. The scaffold is a vision.\rThe scaffold is not a piece of carpentry; the scaffold is not a machine; the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood, iron and cords.\rIt seems as though it were a being, possessed of I know not what sombre initiative; one would say that this piece of carpenter's work saw, that this machine heard, that this mechanism understood, that this wood, this iron, and these cords were possessed of will. In the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise, and as though taking part in what is going on.\rThe scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner; it devours, it eats flesh, it drinks blood; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter, a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted.\rTherefore, the impression was terrible and profound; on the day following the execution, and on many succeeding days, the Bishop appeared to be crushed.\rThe almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice tormented him.\rHe, who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction, seemed to be reproaching himself. At times he talked to himself, and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice.\rThis is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved:\r\"I did not think that it was so monstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law.\rDeath belongs to God alone. By what right do men touch that unknown thing?\"\rIn course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished. Nevertheless, it was observed that the Bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution.\rM. Myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying.\rHe did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and his greatest labor.\rWidowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him; he came of his own accord.\rHe understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love, of the mother who had lost her child.\rAs he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech.\rEvery cure furnished the pretext for a good meal:\rthe Bishop did not interfere. With that exception, his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water, and oil soup.\rThus it was said in the town, when the Bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cure, he indulges in the cheer of a trappist.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639480546, "end": 1639739746, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639739772, "snapshot": "1639480546", "state": "closed", "author": "0xEA7207Eb1B8F2A0C7Ad9ECf8145f1915dc1E19f1", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
