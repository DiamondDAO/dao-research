I also have my patients, and then, too, I have some whom I call my unfortunates.\"\rAgain he wrote:\r\"Do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you.\rThe very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter.\"\rIt chanced that a worthy cure, I know not whether it was the cure of Couloubroux or the cure of Pompierry, took it into his head to ask him one day, probably at the instigation of Madame Magloire, whether Monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion, to a certain extent, in leaving his door unfastened day and night, at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter, and whether, in short, he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded.\rThe Bishop touched his shoulder, with gentle gravity, and said to him, \"Nisi Dominus custodierit domum, in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam,\" Unless the Lord guard the house, in vain do they watch who guard it.\rThen he spoke of something else.\rHe was fond of saying, \"There is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of dragoons,--only,\" he added, \"ours must be tranquil.\"\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER VII \rCRAVATTE \r It is here that a fact falls naturally into place, which we must not omit, because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a man the Bishop of D---- was.\rAfter the destruction of the band of Gaspard Bes, who had infested the gorges of Ollioules, one of his lieutenants, Cravatte, took refuge in the mountains.\rHe concealed himself for some time with his bandits, the remnant of Gaspard Bes's troop, in the county of Nice; then he made his way to Piedmont, and suddenly reappeared in France, in the vicinity of Barcelonette.\rHe was first seen at Jauziers, then at Tuiles.\rHe hid himself in the caverns of the Joug-de-l'Aigle, and thence he descended towards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of Ubaye and Ubayette.\rHe even pushed as far as Embrun, entered the cathedral one night, and despoiled the sacristy.\rHis highway robberies laid waste the country-side. The gendarmes were set on his track, but in vain. He always escaped; sometimes he resisted by main force.\rHe was a bold wretch.\rIn the midst of all this terror the Bishop arrived. He was making his circuit to Chastelar.\rThe mayor came to meet him, and urged him to retrace his steps.\rCravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as Arche, and beyond; there was danger even with an escort; it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose.\r\"Therefore,\" said the Bishop, \"I intend to go without escort.\"\r\"You do not really mean that, Monseigneur!\" exclaimed the mayor.\r\"I do mean it so thoroughly that I absolutely refuse any gendarmes, and shall set out in an hour.\"\r\"Set out?\"\r\"Set out.\"\r\"Alone?\"\r\"Alone.\"\r\"Monseigneur, you will not do that!\"\r\"There exists yonder in the mountains,\" said the Bishop, a tiny community no bigger than that, which I have not seen for three years. They are my good friends, those gentle and honest shepherds.\rThey own one goat out of every thirty that they tend.\rThey make very pretty woollen cords of various colors, and they play the mountain airs on little flutes with six holes.\rThey need to be told of the good God now and then.\rWhat would they say to a bishop who was afraid? What would they say if I did not go?\"\r\"But the brigands, Monseigneur?\"\r\"Hold,\" said the Bishop, \"I must think of that.\rYou are right. I may meet them.\rThey, too, need to be told of the good God.\"\r\"But, Monseigneur, there is a band of them!\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639479737, "end": 1639738937, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639738962, "snapshot": "1639479737", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa85AfCd03BFa63f0eB0E746D7Bcf81b2234DdD7e", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
