He always escaped; sometimes he resisted by main force.\rHe was a bold wretch.\rIn the midst of all this terror the Bishop arrived. He was making his circuit to Chastelar.\rThe mayor came to meet him, and urged him to retrace his steps.\rCravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as Arche, and beyond; there was danger even with an escort; it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose.\r\"Therefore,\" said the Bishop, \"I intend to go without escort.\"\r\"You do not really mean that, Monseigneur!\" exclaimed the mayor.\r\"I do mean it so thoroughly that I absolutely refuse any gendarmes, and shall set out in an hour.\"\r\"Set out?\"\r\"Set out.\"\r\"Alone?\"\r\"Alone.\"\r\"Monseigneur, you will not do that!\"\r\"There exists yonder in the mountains,\" said the Bishop, a tiny community no bigger than that, which I have not seen for three years. They are my good friends, those gentle and honest shepherds.\rThey own one goat out of every thirty that they tend.\rThey make very pretty woollen cords of various colors, and they play the mountain airs on little flutes with six holes.\rThey need to be told of the good God now and then.\rWhat would they say to a bishop who was afraid? What would they say if I did not go?\"\r\"But the brigands, Monseigneur?\"\r\"Hold,\" said the Bishop, \"I must think of that.\rYou are right. I may meet them.\rThey, too, need to be told of the good God.\"\r\"But, Monseigneur, there is a band of them!\rA flock of wolves!\"\r\"Monsieur le maire, it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that Jesus has constituted me the shepherd.\rWho knows the ways of Providence?\"\r\"They will rob you, Monseigneur.\"\r\"I have nothing.\"\r\"They will kill you.\"\r\"An old goodman of a priest, who passes along mumbling his prayers? Bah!\rTo what purpose?\"\r\"Oh, mon Dieu! what if you should meet them!\"\r\"I should beg alms of them for my poor.\"\r\"Do not go, Monseigneur.\rIn the name of Heaven!\rYou are risking your life!\"\r\"Monsieur le maire,\" said the Bishop, \"is that really all? I am not in the world to guard my own life, but to guard souls.\"\rThey had to allow him to do as he pleased.\rHe set out, accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide.\rHis obstinacy was bruited about the country-side, and caused great consternation.\rHe would take neither his sister nor Madame Magloire.\rHe traversed the mountain on mule-back, encountered no one, and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his \"good friends,\" the shepherds. He remained there for a fortnight, preaching, administering the sacrament, teaching, exhorting.\rWhen the time of his departure approached, he resolved to chant a Te Deum pontifically.\rHe mentioned it to the cure.\rBut what was to be done?\rThere were no episcopal ornaments. They could only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy, with a few ancient chasubles of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace.\r\"Bah!\" said the Bishop.\r\"Let us announce our Te Deum from the pulpit, nevertheless, Monsieur le Cure.\rThings will arrange themselves.\"\rThey instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood. All the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly.\rWhile they were thus embarrassed, a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the Bishop, by two unknown horsemen, who departed on the instant.\rThe chest was opened; it contained a cope of cloth of gold, a mitre ornamented with diamonds, an archbishop's cross, a magnificent crosier,--all the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of Notre Dame d'Embrun. In the chest was a paper, on which these words were written, \"From Cravatte to Monseigneur Bienvenu.\"\r\"Did not I say that things would come right of themselves?\" said the Bishop.\rThen he added, with a smile, \"To him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop.\"\r\"Monseigneur,\" murmured the cure, throwing back his head with a smile. \"God--or the Devil.\"\rThe Bishop looked steadily at the cure, and repeated with authority, \"God!\"\rWhen he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity, all along the road.\rAt the priest's house in Chastelar he rejoined Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire, who were waiting for him, and he said to his sister:\r\"Well! was I in the right?\rThe poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands, and he returns from them with his hands full. I set out bearing only my faith in God; I have brought back the treasure of a cathedral.\"\rThat evening, before he went to bed, he said again:\r\"Let us never fear robbers nor murderers.\rThose are dangers from without, petty dangers.\rLet us fear ourselves.\rPrejudices are the real robbers; vices are the real murderers.\rThe great dangers lie within ourselves. What matters it what threatens our head or our purse!\rLet us think only of that which threatens our soul.\"\rThen, turning to his sister:\r\"Sister, never a precaution on the part of the priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, God permits.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639480582, "end": 1639739782, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639739802, "snapshot": "1639480582", "state": "closed", "author": "0xac78747BAFa8C76FBfAC8A3a76f8Ef81F52920A3", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
