Myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied the see of D---- As has been seen, he called it regulating his household expenses.\rPray, believe, enter into life:\rthe Father is there.\" When he descended from the scaffold, there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass.\rThey did not know which was most worthy of admiration, his pallor or his serenity. On his return to the humble dwelling, which he designated, with a smile, as his palace, he said to his sister, \"I have just officiated pontifically.\"\rSince the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood, there were people in the town who said, when commenting on this conduct of the Bishop, \"It is affectation.\"\rThis, however, was a remark which was confined to the drawing-rooms. The populace, which perceives no jest in holy deeds, was touched, and admired him.\rAs for the Bishop, it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine, and it was a long time before he recovered from it.\rIn fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected and prepared, it has something about it which produces hallucination. One may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing upon it, from saying yes or no, so long as one has not seen a guillotine with one's own eyes: but if one encounters one of them, the shock is violent; one is forced to decide, and to take part for or against. Some admire it, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like Beccaria. The guillotine is the concretion of the law; it is called vindicte; it is not neutral, and it does not permit you to remain neutral. He who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers. All social problems erect their interrogation point around this chopping-knife. The scaffold is a vision.\rThe scaffold is not a piece of carpentry; the scaffold is not a machine; the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood, iron and cords.\rIt seems as though it were a being, possessed of I know not what sombre initiative; one would say that this piece of carpenter's work saw, that this machine heard, that this mechanism understood, that this wood, this iron, and these cords were possessed of will. In the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise, and as though taking part in what is going on.\rThe scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner; it devours, it eats flesh, it drinks blood; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter, a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted.\rTherefore, the impression was terrible and profound; on the day following the execution, and on many succeeding days, the Bishop appeared to be crushed.\rIn this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood, and four straw-seated chairs. In addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an antique sideboard, painted pink, in water colors.\rOut of a similar sideboard, properly draped with white napery and imitation lace, the Bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory.\rHis wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D---- had more than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for Monseigneur's oratory; on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor.\r\"The most beautiful of altars,\" he said, \"is the soul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking God.\"\rIn his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an arm-chair, also in straw, in his bedroom.\rWhen, by chance, he received seven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, \ror the general, or the staff of the regiment in garrison, or several pupils from the little seminary, the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and the arm-chair from the bedroom:\rin this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors.\rA room was dismantled for each new guest.\rIt sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party; the Bishop then relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front of the chimney if it was winter, or by strolling in the garden if it was summer.\rThere was still another chair in the detached alcove, but the straw was half gone from it, and it had but three legs, so that it was of service only when propped against the wall.\rMademoiselle Baptistine had also in her own room a very large easy-chair of wood, which had formerly been gilded, and which was covered with flowered pekin; but they had been obliged to hoist this bergere up to the first story through the window, as the staircase was too narrow; it could not, therefore, be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture.\rMademoiselle Baptistine's ambition had been to be able to purchase a set of drawing-room furniture in yellow Utrecht velvet, stamped with a rose pattern, and with mahogany in swan's neck style, with a sofa.\rBut this would have cost five hundred francs at least, and in view of the fact that she had only been able to lay by forty-two francs and ten sous for this purpose in the course of five years, she had ended by renouncing the idea.\rHowever, who is there who has attained his ideal?\rNothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the Bishop's bedchamber.\rA glazed door opened on the garden; opposite this was the bed,--a hospital bed of iron, with a canopy of green serge; in the shadow of the bed, behind a curtain, were the utensils of the toilet, which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world: there were two doors, one near the chimney, opening into the oratory; the other near the bookcase, opening into the dining-room. The bookcase was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books; the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble, and habitually without fire. In the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron, ornamented above with two garlanded vases, and flutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf, which was a sort of episcopal luxury; above the chimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper, with the silver worn off, fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen; near the glass door a large table with an inkstand, loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes; before the table an arm-chair of straw; in front of the bed a prie-Dieu, borrowed from the oratory.\r\"But, Monseigneur, there is a band of them!\rA flock of wolves!\"\r\"Monsieur le maire, it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that Jesus has constituted me the shepherd.\rLet us fear ourselves.\rPrejudices are the real robbers; vices are the real murderers.\rThe great dangers lie within ourselves. What matters it what threatens our head or our purse!\rLet us think only of that which threatens our soul.\"\rThen, turning to his sister:\r\"Sister, never a precaution on the part of the priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, God permits.\rLet us confine ourselves to prayer, when we think that a danger is approaching us.\rLet us pray, not for ourselves, but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account.\"\rHowever, such incidents were rare in his life.\rWe relate those of which we know; but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at the same moment.\rOne month of his year resembled one hour of his day.\rAs to what became of \"the treasure\" of the cathedral of Embrun, we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction. It consisted of very handsome things, very tempting things, and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate.\rStolen they had already been elsewhere. Half of the adventure was completed; it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor.\rHowever, we make no assertions on this point.\rOnly, a rather obscure note was found among the Bishop's papers, which may bear some relation to this matter, and which is couched in these terms, \"The question is, to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital.\"\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER VIII \rPHILOSOPHY AFTER DRINKING \r The senator above mentioned was a clever man, who had made his own way, heedless of those things which present obstacles, and which are called conscience, sworn faith, justice, duty:\rhe had marched straight to his goal, without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest.\rHe was an old attorney, softened by success; not a bad man by any means, who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons, his sons-in-law, his relations, and even to his friends, having wisely seized upon, in life, good sides, good opportunities, good windfalls. Everything else seemed to him very stupid.\rHe was intelligent, and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of Epicurus; while he was, in reality, only a product of Pigault-Lebrun. He laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things, and at the \"Crotchets of that good old fellow the Bishop.\" He even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel himself, who listened to him.\rOn some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect what, Count*** [this senator] and M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect. At dessert, the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, though still perfectly dignified, exclaimed:--\r\"Egad, Bishop, let's have a discussion.\rIt is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking.\rWe are two augurs. I am going to make a confession to you.\rI have a philosophy of my own.\"\r\"And you are right,\" replied the Bishop.\r\"As one makes one's philosophy, so one lies on it.\rYou are on the bed of purple, senator.\"\rThe senator was encouraged, and went on:--\r\"Let us be good fellows.\"\r\"Good devils even,\" said the Bishop.\r\"I declare to you,\" continued the senator, \"that the Marquis d'Argens, Pyrrhon, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are no rascals. I have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges.\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646137, "end": 1639905337, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905352, "snapshot": "1639646137", "state": "closed", "author": "0x35606205B713Da42B1FDb2652c2C6AaA222fa3D6", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
