Everything else seemed to him very stupid.\rHe was intelligent, and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of Epicurus; while he was, in reality, only a product of Pigault-Lebrun. He laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things, and at the \"Crotchets of that good old fellow the Bishop.\" He even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel himself, who listened to him.\rOn some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect what, Count*** [this senator] and M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect. At dessert, the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, though still perfectly dignified, exclaimed:--\r\"Egad, Bishop, let's have a discussion.\rIt is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking.\rWe are two augurs. I am going to make a confession to you.\rI have a philosophy of my own.\"\r\"And you are right,\" replied the Bishop.\r\"As one makes one's philosophy, so one lies on it.\rYou are on the bed of purple, senator.\"\rThe senator was encouraged, and went on:--\r\"Let us be good fellows.\"\r\"Good devils even,\" said the Bishop.\rWhither will enjoyment lead me? To nothingness; but I shall have enjoyed myself.\rMy choice is made. One must eat or be eaten.\rI shall eat.\rIt is better to be the tooth than the grass.\rSuch is my wisdom.\rAfter which, go whither I push thee, the grave-digger is there; the Pantheon for some of us: all falls into the great hole.\rEnd.\rFinis.\rTotal liquidation. This is the vanishing-point. Death is death, believe me. I laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell me on that subject.\rFables of nurses; bugaboo for children; Jehovah for men.\rNo; our to-morrow is the night.\rBeyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness.\rYou have been Sardanapalus, you have been Vincent de Paul--it makes no difference.\rThat is the truth.\rThen live your life, above all things.\rMake use of your _I_ while you have it.\rIn truth, Bishop, I tell you that I have a philosophy of my own, and I have my philosophers.\rI don't let myself be taken in with that nonsense.\rOf course, there must be something for those who are down,--for the barefooted beggars, knife-grinders, and miserable wretches.\rLegends, chimeras, the soul, immortality, paradise, the stars, are provided for them to swallow. They gobble it down.\rThey spread it on their dry bread. He who has nothing else has the good.\rGod.\rThat is the least he can have.\rI oppose no objection to that; but I reserve Monsieur Naigeon for myself.\rThe good God is good for the populace.\"\rThe Bishop clapped his hands.\r\"That's talking!\" he exclaimed.\r\"What an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism!\rNot every one who wants it can have it.\rAh! when one does have it, one is no longer a dupe, one does not stupidly allow one's self to be exiled like Cato, nor stoned like Stephen, nor burned alive like Jeanne d'Arc. Those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible, and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness,--places, sinecures, dignities, power, whether well or ill acquired, lucrative recantations, useful treacheries, savory capitulations of conscience,--and that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished.\rHow agreeable that is! I do not say that with reference to you, senator.\rNevertheless, it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you.\rYou great lords have, so you say, a philosophy of your own, and for yourselves, which is exquisite, refined, accessible to the rich alone, good for all sauces, and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably.\rThis philosophy has been extracted from the depths, and unearthed by special seekers.\rBut you are good-natured princes, and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good God should constitute the philosophy of the people, very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor.\"\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER IX \rTHE BROTHER AS DEPICTED BY THE SISTER\r In order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the Bishop of D----, and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions, their thoughts, their feminine instincts even, which are easily alarmed, to the habits and purposes of the Bishop, without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them, we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter from Mademoiselle Baptistine to Madame the Vicomtess de Boischevron, the friend of her childhood.\rThis letter is in our possession. \rD----, Dec. 16, 18--. MY GOOD MADAM:\rNot a day passes without our speaking of you. It is our established custom; but there is another reason besides. Just imagine, while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls, Madam Magloire has made some discoveries; now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over, would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours.\rMadam Magloire has pulled off all the paper. There were things beneath.\rMy drawing-room, which contains no furniture, and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing, is fifteen feet in height, eighteen square, with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded, and with beams, as in yours. This was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital. And the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers.\rBut my room is the one you ought to see.\rMadam Magloire has discovered, under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top, some paintings, which without being good are very tolerable.\rThe subject is Telemachus being knighted by Minerva in some gardens, the name of which escapes me.\rIn short, where the Roman ladies repaired on one single night.\rWhat shall I say to you?\rI have Romans, and Roman ladies [here occurs an illegible word], and the whole train. Madam Magloire has cleaned it all off; this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired, and the whole revarnished, and my chamber will be a regular museum.\rShe has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables of ancient fashion. They asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them, but it is much better to give the money to the poor; and they are very ugly besides, and I should much prefer a round table of mahogany.\rI am always very happy.\rMy brother is so good.\rHe gives all he has to the poor and sick.\rWe are very much cramped.\rThe country is trying in the winter, and we really must do something for those who are in need.\rWe are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that these are great treats.\rMy brother has ways of his own.\rWhen he talks, he says that a bishop ought to be so.\rJust imagine! the door of our house is never fastened. Whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother's room. He fears nothing, even at night.\rThat is his sort of bravery, he says.\rHe does not wish me or Madame Magloire feel any fear for him. He exposes himself to all sorts of dangers, and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it.\rOne must know how to understand him.\rHe goes out in the rain, he walks in the water, he travels in winter. He fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters, nor night.\r year he went quite alone into a country of robbers.\rHe would not take us.\rHe was absent for a fortnight.\rOn his return nothing had happened to him; he was thought to be dead, but was perfectly well, and said, \"This is the way I have been robbed!\"\rAnd then he opened a trunk full of jewels, all the jewels of the cathedral of Embrun, which the thieves had given him.\rWhen he returned on that occasion, I could not refrain from scolding him a little, taking care, however, not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise, so that no one might hear me.\rAt first I used to say to myself, \"There are no dangers which will stop him; he is terrible.\"\rNow I have ended by getting used to it. I make a sign to Madam Magloire that she is not to oppose him. He risks himself as he sees fit.\rI carry off Madam Magloire, I enter my chamber, I pray for him and fall asleep.\rI am at ease, because I know that if anything were to happen to him, it would be the end of me.\rI should go to the good God with my brother and my bishop.\rIt has cost Madam Magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences.\rBut now the habit has been acquired.\rWe pray together, we tremble together, and we fall asleep.\rIf the devil were to enter this house, he would be allowed to do so.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639480605, "end": 1639739805, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639739832, "snapshot": "1639480605", "state": "closed", "author": "0x81840f066850f3E289DD6E1FbCDb6eCd26BC1190", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
