You think it inexorable, sir; but what of the whole monarchy, sir? Carrier is a bandit; but what name do you give to Montrevel? Fouquier-Tainville is a rascal; but what is your opinion as to Lamoignon-Baville? Maillard is terrible; but Saulx-Tavannes, if you please?\rDuchene senior is ferocious; but what epithet will you allow me for the elder Letellier?\rJourdan-Coupe-Tete is a monster; but not so great a one as M. the Marquis de Louvois. Sir, sir, I am sorry for Marie Antoinette, archduchess and queen; but I am also sorry for that poor Huguenot woman, who, in 1685, under Louis the Great, sir, while with a nursing infant, was bound, naked to the waist, to a stake, and the child kept at a distance; her breast swelled with milk and her heart with anguish; the little one, hungry and pale, beheld that breast and cried and agonized; the executioner said to the woman, a mother and a nurse, `Abjure!' giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the death of her conscience.\rWhat say you to that torture of Tantalus as applied to a mother?\rBear this well in mind sir: the French Revolution had its reasons for existence; its wrath will be absolved by the future; its result is the world made better. From its most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the human race.\rI abridge, I stop, I have too much the advantage; moreover, I am dying.\"\rAnd ceasing to gaze at the Bishop, the conventionary concluded his thoughts in these tranquil words:--\r\"Yes, the brutalities of progress are called revolutions. When they are over, this fact is recognized,--that the human race has been treated harshly, but that it has progressed.\"\rThe conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all the inmost intrenchments of the Bishop.\rOne remained, however, and from this intrenchment, the last resource of Monseigneur Bienvenu's resistance, came forth this reply, wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning:--\r\"Progress should believe in God.\rGood cannot have an impious servitor. He who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race.\"\rThe former representative of the people made no reply.\rHe was seized with a fit of trembling.\rHe looked towards heaven, and in his glance a tear gathered slowly.\rWhen the eyelid was full, the tear trickled down his livid cheek, and he said, almost in a stammer, quite low, and to himself, while his eyes were plunged in the depths:--\r\"O thou!\rO ideal!\rThou alone existest!\"\rThe Bishop experienced an indescribable shock.\rAfter a pause, the old man raised a finger heavenward and said:--\r\"The infinite is.\rHe is there.\rIf the infinite had no person, person would be without limit; it would not be infinite; in other words, it would not exist.\rThere is, then, an _I_. That _I_ of the infinite is God.\"\rThe dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice, and with the shiver of ecstasy, as though he beheld some one. When he had spoken, his eyes closed.\rThe effort had exhausted him. It was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him.\rThat which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death.\rThe first proof of charity in the priest, in the bishop especially, is poverty.\rThis is, no doubt, what the Bishop of D---- thought.\rIt must not be supposed, however, that he shared what we call the \"ideas of the century\" on certain delicate points.\rHe took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment, and maintained silence on questions in which Church and State were implicated; but if he had been strongly pressed, it seems that he would have been found to be an ultramontane rather than a gallican.\rSince we are making a portrait, and since we do not wish to conceal anything, we are forced to add that he was glacial towards Napoleon in his decline. Beginning with 1813, he gave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations.\rHe refused to see him, as he passed through on his return from the island of Elba, and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the Emperor in his diocese during the Hundred Days.\rBesides his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, he had two brothers, one a general, the other a prefect.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646341, "end": 1639905541, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905561, "snapshot": "1639646341", "state": "closed", "author": "0xD35E8D11c3de0884afac749f6b8a442567Ec618D", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
