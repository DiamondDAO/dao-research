I do not blame the law, but I bless God.\rIn the department of the Isere, in the Var, in the two departments of the Alpes, the Hautes, and the Basses, the peasants have not even wheelbarrows; they transport their manure on the backs of men; they have no candles, and they burn resinous sticks, and bits of rope dipped in pitch. That is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of Dauphine.\rThey make bread for six months at one time; they bake it with dried cow-dung. In the winter they break this bread up with an axe, and they soak it for twenty-four hours, in order to render it eatable.\rMy brethren, have pity! behold the suffering on all sides of you!\"\rBorn a Provencal, he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south.\rHe said, \"En be! moussu, ses sage?\" as in lower Languedoc; \"Onte anaras passa?\" as in the Basses-Alpes; \"Puerte un bouen moutu embe un bouen fromage grase,\" as in upper Dauphine.\rThis pleased the people extremely, and contributed not a little to win him access to all spirits.\rHe was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains.\rHe understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms.\rAs he spoke all tongues, he entered into all hearts.\rMoreover, he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes.\rHe condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account.\rHe said, \"Examine the road over which the fault has passed.\"\rBeing, as he described himself with a smile, an ex-sinner, he had none of the asperities of austerity, and he professed, with a good deal of distinctness, and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous, a doctrine which may be summed up as follows:--\r\"Man has upon him his flesh, which is at once his burden and his temptation.\rHe drags it with him and yields to it. He must watch it, cheek it, repress it, and obey it only at the last extremity.\rThere may be some fault even in this obedience; but the fault thus committed is venial; it is a fall, but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer.\r\"To be a saint is the exception; to be an upright man is the rule. Err, fall, sin if you will, but be upright.\r\"The least possible sin is the law of man.\rNo sin at all is the dream of the angel.\rAll which is terrestrial is subject to sin. Sin is a gravitation.\"\rWhen he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly, and growing angry very quickly, \"Oh! oh!\" he said, with a smile; \"to all appearance, this is a great crime which all the world commits.\rThese are hypocrisies which have taken fright, and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter.\"\rHe was indulgent towards women and poor people, on whom the burden of human society rest.\rHe said, \"The faults of women, of children, of the feeble, the indigent, and the ignorant, are the fault of the husbands, the fathers, the masters, the strong, the rich, and the wise.\"\rHe said, moreover, \"Teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible; society is culpable, in that it does not afford instruction gratis; it is responsible for the night which it produces. This soul is full of shadow; sin is therein committed.\rThe guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin, but the person who has created the shadow.\"\rIt will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things:\rI suspect that he obtained it from the Gospel.\rOne day he heard a criminal case, which was in preparation and on the point of trial, discussed in a drawing-room. A wretched man, being at the end of his resources, had coined counterfeit money, out of love for a woman, and for the child which he had had by her. Counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch. The woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man.\rShe was held, but there were no proofs except against her.\rShe alone could accuse her lover, and destroy him by her confession.\rShe denied; they insisted.\rShe persisted in her denial.\rThereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown. He invented an infidelity on the part of the lover, and succeeded, by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented, in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival, and that the man was deceiving her.\rThereupon, exasperated by jealousy, she denounced her lover, confessed all, proved all.\rThe man was ruined.\rHe was shortly to be tried at Aix with his accomplice.\rThey were relating the matter, and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate. By bringing jealousy into play, he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath, he had educed the justice of revenge.\rThe Bishop listened to all this in silence.\rWhen they had finished, he inquired,--\r\"Where are this man and woman to be tried?\"\r\"At the Court of Assizes.\"\rHe went on, \"And where will the advocate of the crown be tried?\"\rA tragic event occurred at D---- A man was condemned to death for murder.\rHe was a wretched fellow, not exactly educated, not exactly ignorant, who had been a mountebank at fairs, and a writer for the public.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646071, "end": 1639905271, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905291, "snapshot": "1639646071", "state": "closed", "author": "0xc91cb24Ff805896a43e322F2eEb8500381262c53", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
