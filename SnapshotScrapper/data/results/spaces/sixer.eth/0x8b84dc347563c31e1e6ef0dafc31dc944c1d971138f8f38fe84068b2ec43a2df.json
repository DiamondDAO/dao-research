At times he talked to himself, and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice.\rThis is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved:\r\"I did not think that it was so monstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law.\rDeath belongs to God alone. By what right do men touch that unknown thing?\"\rIn course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished. Nevertheless, it was observed that the Bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution.\rM. Myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying.\rHe did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and his greatest labor.\rWidowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him; he came of his own accord.\rHe understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love, of the mother who had lost her child.\rAs he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech.\rOh, admirable consoler!\rHe sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness, but to magnify and dignify it by hope.\rHe said:--\r\"Have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead. Think not of that which perishes.\rGaze steadily.\rYou will perceive the living light of your well-beloved dead in the depths of heaven.\" He knew that faith is wholesome.\rHe sought to counsel and calm the despairing man, by pointing out to him the resigned man, and to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER V \r MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU MADE HIS CASSOCKS LAST TOO LONG \r The private life of M. Myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his public life.\rThe voluntary poverty in which the Bishop of D---- lived, would have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have viewed it close at hand.\rLike all old men, and like the majority of thinkers, he slept little. This brief slumber was profound.\rIn the morning he meditated for an hour, then he said his mass, either at the cathedral or in his own house. His mass said, he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows.\rThen he set to work.\rA Bishop is a very busy man:\rhe must every day receive the secretary of the bishopric, who is generally a canon, and nearly every day his vicars-general. He has congregations to reprove, privileges to grant, a whole ecclesiastical library to examine,-- prayer-books, diocesan catechisms, books of hours, etc.,--charges to write, sermons to authorize, cures and mayors to reconcile, a clerical correspondence, an administrative correspondence; on one side the State, on the other the Holy See; and a thousand matters of business.\rWhat time was left to him, after these thousand details of business, and his offices and his breviary, he bestowed first on the necessitous, the sick, and the afflicted; the time which was left to him from the afflicted, the sick, and the necessitous, he devoted to work. Sometimes he dug in his garden; again, he read or wrote.\rHe had but one word for both these kinds of toil; he called them gardening. \"The mind is a garden,\" said he.\rTowards mid-day, when the weather was fine, he went forth and took a stroll in the country or in town, often entering lowly dwellings. He was seen walking alone, buried in his own thoughts, his eyes cast down, supporting himself on his long cane, clad in his wadded purple garment of silk, which was very warm, wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes, and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points.\rIt was a perfect festival wherever he appeared.\rOne would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it. The children and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as for the sun.\rHe bestowed his blessing, and they blessed him. They pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything.\rHere and there he halted, accosted the little boys and girls, and smiled upon the mothers.\rHe visited the poor so long as he had any money; when he no longer had any, he visited the rich.\rAs he made his cassocks last a long while, and did not wish to have it noticed, he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak.\rThis inconvenienced him somewhat in summer.\rOn his return, he dined.\rThe dinner resembled his breakfast.\rAt half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister, Madame Magloire standing behind them and serving them at table. Nothing could be more frugal than this repast.\rIf, however, the Bishop had one of his cures to supper, Madame Magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve Monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake, or with some fine game from the mountains.\rEvery cure furnished the pretext for a good meal:\rthe Bishop did not interfere. With that exception, his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water, and oil soup.\rThus it was said in the town, when the Bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cure, he indulges in the cheer of a trappist.\rAfter supper he conversed for half an hour with Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire; then he retired to his own room and set to writing, sometimes on loose sheets, and again on the margin of some folio. He was a man of letters and rather learned.\rHe left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts; among others, a dissertation on this verse in Genesis, In the beginning, the spirit of God floated upon the waters.\rWith this verse he compares three texts: the Arabic verse which says, The winds of God blew; Flavius Josephus who says, A wind from above was precipitated upon the earth; and finally, the Chaldaic paraphrase of Onkelos, which renders it, A wind coming from God blew upon the face of the waters. In another dissertation, he examines the theological works of Hugo, Bishop of Ptolemais, great-grand-uncle to the writer of this book, and establishes the fact, that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works published during the last century, under the pseudonym of Barleycourt.\rSometimes, in the midst of his reading, no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand, he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation, whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself.\rThese lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them.\rWe now have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled Correspondence of Lord Germain with Generals Clinton, Cornwallis, and the Admirals on the American station.\rVersailles, Poincot, book-seller; and Paris, Pissot, bookseller, Quai des Augustins.\rHere is the note:--\r\"Oh, you who are!\r\"Ecclesiastes calls you the All-powerful; the Maccabees call you the Creator; the Epistle to the Ephesians calls you liberty; Baruch calls you Immensity; the Psalms call you Wisdom and Truth; John calls you Light; the Books of Kings call you Lord; Exodus calls you Providence; Leviticus, Sanctity; Esdras, Justice; the creation calls you God; man calls you Father; but Solomon calls you Compassion, and that is the most beautiful of all your names.\"\rToward nine o'clock in the evening the two women retired and betook themselves to their chambers on the first floor, leaving him alone until morning on the ground floor.\rIt is necessary that we should, in this place, give an exact idea of the dwelling of the Bishop of D----\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER VI \rWHO GUARDED HIS HOUSE FOR HIM \r The house in which he lived consisted, as we have said, of a ground floor, and one story above; three rooms on the ground floor, three chambers on the first, and an attic above.\rBehind the house was a garden, a quarter of an acre in extent.\rThe two women occupied the first floor; the Bishop was lodged below.\rThe first room, opening on the street, served him as dining-room, the second was his bedroom, and the third his oratory.\rThere was no exit possible from this oratory, except by passing through the bedroom, nor from the bedroom, without passing through the dining-room. At the end of the suite, in the oratory, there was a detached alcove with a bed, for use in cases of hospitality.\rThe Bishop offered this bed to country curates whom business or the requirements of their parishes brought to D----\rThe pharmacy of the hospital, a small building which had been added to the house, and abutted on the garden, had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar.\rIn addition to this, there was in the garden a stable, which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital, and in which the Bishop kept two cows.\rNo matter what the quantity of milk they gave, he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital.\r\"I am paying my tithes,\" he said.\rHis bedroom was tolerably large, and rather difficult to warm in bad weather.\rAs wood is extremely dear at D----, he hit upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed. Here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold: he called it his winter salon.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646097, "end": 1639905297, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905321, "snapshot": "1639646097", "state": "closed", "author": "0xE48e85256aE15e5f973991836B0114849DcB2665", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
