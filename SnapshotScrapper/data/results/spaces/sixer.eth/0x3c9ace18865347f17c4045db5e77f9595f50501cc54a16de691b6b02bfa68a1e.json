There is no power which has not its dependents.\rThere is no fortune which has not its court.\rThe seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present.\rEvery metropolis has its staff of officials. Every bishop who possesses the least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary, which goes the round, and maintains good order in the episcopal palace, and mounts guard over monseigneur's smile.\rTo please a bishop is equivalent to getting one's foot in the stirrup for a sub-diaconate. It is necessary to walk one's path discreetly; the apostleship does not disdain the canonship.\rJust as there are bigwigs elsewhere, there are big mitres in the Church. These are the bishops who stand well at Court, who are rich, well endowed, skilful, accepted by the world, who know how to pray, no doubt, but who know also how to beg, who feel little scruple at making a whole diocese dance attendance in their person, who are connecting links between the sacristy and diplomacy, who are abbes rather than priests, prelates rather than bishops. Happy those who approach them!\rBeing persons of influence, they create a shower about them, upon the assiduous and the favored, and upon all the young men who understand the art of pleasing, of large parishes, prebends, archidiaconates, chaplaincies, and cathedral posts, while awaiting episcopal honors.\rAs they advance themselves, they cause their satellites to progress also; it is a whole solar system on the march.\rTheir radiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite.\rTheir prosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes, into nice little promotions.\rThe larger the diocese of the patron, the fatter the curacy for the favorite.\rAnd then, there is Rome.\rA bishop who understands how to become an archbishop, an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal, carries you with him as conclavist; you enter a court of papal jurisdiction, you receive the pallium, and behold! you are an auditor, then a papal chamberlain, then monsignor, and from a Grace to an Eminence is only a step, and between the Eminence and the Holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot.\rEvery skull-cap may dream of the tiara. The priest is nowadays the only man who can become a king in a regular manner; and what a king! the supreme king.\rThen what a nursery of aspirations is a seminary!\rHow many blushing choristers, how many youthful abbes bear on their heads Perrette's pot of milk! Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation? in good faith, perchance, and deceiving itself, devotee that it is.\rMonseigneur Bienvenu, poor, humble, retiring, was not accounted among the big mitres.\rThis was plain from the complete absence of young priests about him.\rWe have seen that he \"did not take\" in Paris.\rNot a single future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man.\rNot a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow.\rHis canons and grand-vicars were good old men, rather vulgar like himself, walled up like him in this diocese, without exit to a cardinalship, and who resembled their bishop, with this difference, that they were finished and he was completed.\rThe impossibility of growing great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so well understood, that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix or of Auch, and went off in a great hurry.\rFor, in short, we repeat it, men wish to be pushed.\rA saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor; he might communicate to you, by contagion, an incurable poverty, an anchylosis of the joints, which are useful in advancement, and in short, more renunciation than you desire; and this infectious virtue is avoided.\rHence the isolation of Monseigneur Bienvenu.\rWe live in the midst of a gloomy society. Success; that is the lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption.\rBe it said in passing, that success is a very hideous thing.\rIts false resemblance to merit deceives men.\rFor the masses, success has almost the same profile as supremacy.\rSuccess, that Menaechmus of talent, has one dupe,--history.\rJuvenal and Tacitus alone grumble at it. In our day, a philosophy which is almost official has entered into its service, wears the livery of success, and performs the service of its antechamber.\rSucceed:\rSometimes, if the two old women were not asleep, they heard him pacing slowly along the walks at a very advanced hour of the night.\rHe was there alone, communing with himself, peaceful, adoring, comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether, moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations and the invisible splendor of God, opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the Unknown. At such moments, while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume, illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night, as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation, he could not have told himself, probably, what was passing in his spirit; he felt something take its flight from him, and something descend into him.\rMysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe!\rHe thought of the grandeur and presence of God; of the future eternity, that strange mystery; of the eternity past, a mystery still more strange; of all the infinities, which pierced their way into all his senses, beneath his eyes; and, without seeking to comprehend the incomprehensible, he gazed upon it.\rHe did not study God; he was dazzled by him.\rHe considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms, which communicate aspects to matter, reveal forces by verifying them, create individualities in unity, proportions in extent, the innumerable in the infinite, and, through light, produce beauty. These conjunctions are formed and dissolved incessantly; hence life and death.\rHe seated himself on a wooden bench, with his back against a decrepit vine; he gazed at the stars, past the puny and stunted silhouettes of his fruit-trees. This quarter of an acre, so poorly planted, so encumbered with mean buildings and sheds, was dear to him, and satisfied his wants.\rWhat more was needed by this old man, who divided the leisure of his life, where there was so little leisure, between gardening in the daytime and contemplation at night?\rWas not this narrow enclosure, with the heavens for a ceiling, sufficient to enable him to adore God in his most divine works, in turn?\rDoes not this comprehend all, in fact? and what is there left to desire beyond it? A little garden in which to walk, and immensity in which to dream. At one's feet that which can be cultivated and plucked; over head that which one can study and meditate upon:\rsome flowers on earth, and all the stars in the sky.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER XIV \rWHAT HE THOUGHT\r One last word.\rSince this sort of details might, particularly at the present moment, and to use an expression now in fashion, give to the Bishop of D---- a certain \"pantheistical\" physiognomy, and induce the belief, either to his credit or discredit, that he entertained one of those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century, which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits, and there take on a form and grow until they usurp the place of religion, we insist upon it, that not one of those persons who knew Monseigneur Welcome would have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort. That which enlightened this man was his heart.\rAt that moment he turned his head, took in the traveller's appearance with a single glance, and added, \"By paying for it.\"\rThe man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse, and answered, \"I have money.\"\rOnce more he inquired, \"Will dinner be ready soon?\"\r\"Immediately,\" responded the host.\rThe child returned.\rHe brought back the paper.\rThe host unfolded it eagerly, like a person who is expecting a reply.\rHe seemed to read it attentively, then tossed his head, and remained thoughtful for a moment.\rThen he took a step in the direction of the traveller, who appeared to be immersed in reflections which were not very serene.\r\"I cannot receive you, sir,\" said he.\rThe man half rose.\r\"What!\rAre you afraid that I will not pay you?\rDo you want me to pay you in advance?\rI have money, I tell you.\"\r\"It is not that.\"\r\"What then?\"\r\"You have money--\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646418, "end": 1639905618, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905651, "snapshot": "1639646418", "state": "closed", "author": "0xC09e2C9c81Da54900DBB76e71645bd4Aa0afc5bD", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
