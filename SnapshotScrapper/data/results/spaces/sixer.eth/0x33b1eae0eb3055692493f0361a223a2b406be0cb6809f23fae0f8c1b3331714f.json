Voltaire made sport of Needham, and he was wrong, for Needham's eels prove that God is useless.\rA drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux.\rSuppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger; you have the world.\rMan is the eel. Then what is the good of the Eternal Father?\rThe Jehovah hypothesis tires me, Bishop.\rIt is good for nothing but to produce shallow people, whose reasoning is hollow.\rDown with that great All, which torments me! Hurrah for Zero which leaves me in peace!\rBetween you and me, and in order to empty my sack, and make confession to my pastor, as it behooves me to do, I will admit to you that I have good sense. I am not enthusiastic over your Jesus, who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity.\r'Tis the counsel of an avaricious man to beggars.\rRenunciation; why?\rSacrifice; to what end? I do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of another wolf.\rLet us stick to nature, then.\rWe are at the top; let us have a superior philosophy.\rWhat is the advantage of being at the top, if one sees no further than the end of other people's noses?\rLet us live merrily.\rLife is all.\rThat man has another future elsewhere, on high, below, anywhere, I don't believe; not one single word of it.\rAh! sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me; I must take heed to everything I do; I must cudgel my brains over good and evil, over the just and the unjust, over the fas and the nefas.\rWhy?\rBecause I shall have to render an account of my actions.\rWhen?\rAfter death.\rWhat a fine dream! After my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me. Have a handful of dust seized by a shadow-hand, if you can. Let us tell the truth, we who are initiated, and who have raised the veil of Isis:\rthere is no such thing as either good or evil; there is vegetation.\rLet us seek the real.\rLet us get to the bottom of it.\rLet us go into it thoroughly.\rWhat the deuce! let us go to the bottom of it!\rWe must scent out the truth; dig in the earth for it, and seize it.\rThen it gives you exquisite joys. Then you grow strong, and you laugh.\rI am square on the bottom, I am.\rImmortality, Bishop, is a chance, a waiting for dead men's shoes.\rAh! what a charming promise! trust to it, if you like! What a fine lot Adam has!\rWe are souls, and we shall be angels, with blue wings on our shoulder-blades. Do come to my assistance: is it not Tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star?\rVery well.\rWe shall be the grasshoppers of the stars. And then, besides, we shall see God.\rTa, ta, ta!\rLegends, chimeras, the soul, immortality, paradise, the stars, are provided for them to swallow. They gobble it down.\rThey spread it on their dry bread. He who has nothing else has the good.\rGod.\rThat is the least he can have.\rI oppose no objection to that; but I reserve Monsieur Naigeon for myself.\rThe good God is good for the populace.\"\rThe Bishop clapped his hands.\r\"That's talking!\" he exclaimed.\r\"What an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism!\rNot every one who wants it can have it.\rAh! when one does have it, one is no longer a dupe, one does not stupidly allow one's self to be exiled like Cato, nor stoned like Stephen, nor burned alive like Jeanne d'Arc. Those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible, and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness,--places, sinecures, dignities, power, whether well or ill acquired, lucrative recantations, useful treacheries, savory capitulations of conscience,--and that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished.\rHow agreeable that is! I do not say that with reference to you, senator.\rNevertheless, it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you.\rYou great lords have, so you say, a philosophy of your own, and for yourselves, which is exquisite, refined, accessible to the rich alone, good for all sauces, and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably.\rThis philosophy has been extracted from the depths, and unearthed by special seekers.\rBut you are good-natured princes, and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good God should constitute the philosophy of the people, very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor.\"\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER IX \rTHE BROTHER AS DEPICTED BY THE SISTER\r In order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the Bishop of D----, and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions, their thoughts, their feminine instincts even, which are easily alarmed, to the habits and purposes of the Bishop, without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them, we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter from Mademoiselle Baptistine to Madame the Vicomtess de Boischevron, the friend of her childhood.\rThis letter is in our possession. \rD----, Dec. 16, 18--. MY GOOD MADAM:\rNot a day passes without our speaking of you. It is our established custom; but there is another reason besides. Just imagine, while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls, Madam Magloire has made some discoveries; now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over, would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours.\rMadam Magloire has pulled off all the paper. There were things beneath.\rMy drawing-room, which contains no furniture, and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing, is fifteen feet in height, eighteen square, with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded, and with beams, as in yours. This was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital. And the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers.\rBut my room is the one you ought to see.\rMadam Magloire has discovered, under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top, some paintings, which without being good are very tolerable.\rThe subject is Telemachus being knighted by Minerva in some gardens, the name of which escapes me.\rIn short, where the Roman ladies repaired on one single night.\rWhat shall I say to you?\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646176, "end": 1639905376, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905381, "snapshot": "1639646176", "state": "closed", "author": "0x876E46B11c8F89f7Cf1Ebf45E21066fC4805a009", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
