Inter pocula.\rTo sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow.\rBe the dupe of the infinite! I'm not such a fool.\rI am a nought.\rI call myself Monsieur le Comte Nought, senator.\rDid I exist before my birth?\rNo. Shall I exist after death?\rNo. What am I?\rA little dust collected in an organism. What am I to do on this earth?\rThe choice rests with me: suffer or enjoy.\rWhither will suffering lead me?\rTo nothingness; but I shall have suffered.\rWhither will enjoyment lead me? To nothingness; but I shall have enjoyed myself.\rMy choice is made. One must eat or be eaten.\rI shall eat.\rIt is better to be the tooth than the grass.\rSuch is my wisdom.\rAfter which, go whither I push thee, the grave-digger is there; the Pantheon for some of us: all falls into the great hole.\rEnd.\rFinis.\rTotal liquidation. This is the vanishing-point. Death is death, believe me. I laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell me on that subject.\rFables of nurses; bugaboo for children; Jehovah for men.\rNo; our to-morrow is the night.\rBeyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness.\rYou have been Sardanapalus, you have been Vincent de Paul--it makes no difference.\rThat is the truth.\rThen live your life, above all things.\rMake use of your _I_ while you have it.\rIn truth, Bishop, I tell you that I have a philosophy of my own, and I have my philosophers.\rI don't let myself be taken in with that nonsense.\rOf course, there must be something for those who are down,--for the barefooted beggars, knife-grinders, and miserable wretches.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646163, "end": 1639905363, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905381, "snapshot": "1639646163", "state": "closed", "author": "0x81F8B7cBB3E30AAE9Fafa1BfBb45b5788727f541", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
