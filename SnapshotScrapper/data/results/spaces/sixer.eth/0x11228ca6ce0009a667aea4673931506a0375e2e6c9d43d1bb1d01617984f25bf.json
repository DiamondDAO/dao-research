It is well that there should be witnesses at that moment.\rOne has one's caprices; I should have liked to last until the dawn, but I know that I shall hardly live three hours.\rIt will be night then. What does it matter, after all?\rDying is a simple affair. One has no need of the light for that.\rSo be it.\rI shall die by starlight.\"\rThe old man turned to the shepherd lad:--\r\"Go to thy bed; thou wert awake all last night; thou art tired.\"\rThe child entered the hut.\rThe old man followed him with his eyes, and added, as though speaking to himself:--\r\"I shall die while he sleeps.\rThe two slumbers may be good neighbors.\"\rThe Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He did not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the whole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest:\rhe, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at \"His Grace,\" was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and he was almost tempted to retort \"citizen.\" He was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but which was not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of the Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the powerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably, the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.\rMeanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality, in which one could have distinguished, possibly, that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust.\rThe Bishop, on his side, although he generally restrained his curiosity, which, in his opinion, bordered on a fault, could not refrain from examining the member of the Convention with an attention which, as it did not have its course in sympathy, would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A member of the Convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law, even of the law of charity.\rG----, calm, his body almost upright, his voice vibrating, was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist. The Revolution had many of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof. Though so near to his end, he preserved all the gestures of health. In his clear glance, in his firm tone, in the robust movement of his shoulders, there was something calculated to disconcert death. Azrael, the Mohammedan angel of the sepulchre, would have turned back, and thought that he had mistaken the door.\rG---- seemed to be dying because he willed it so.\rThere was freedom in his agony.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646246, "end": 1639905446, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905471, "snapshot": "1639646246", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6ca16Cb32Ee6E67fC6020f88f5F454F6d0078699", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
