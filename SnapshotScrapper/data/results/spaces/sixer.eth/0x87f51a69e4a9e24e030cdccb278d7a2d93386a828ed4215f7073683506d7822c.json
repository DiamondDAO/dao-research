He had been a terrible man. How did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a provost's court, on the return of the legitimate princes? They need not have cut off his head, if you please; clemency must be exercised, agreed; but a good banishment for life.\rAn example, in short, etc.\rBesides, he was an atheist, like all the rest of those people.\rGossip of the geese about the vulture.\rWas G---- a vulture after all?\rYes; if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his.\rAs he had not voted for the death of the king, he had not been included in the decrees of exile, and had been able to remain in France.\rHe dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city, far from any hamlet, far from any road, in some hidden turn of a very wild valley, no one knew exactly where.\rHe had there, it was said, a sort of field, a hole, a lair.\rThere were no neighbors, not even passers-by. Since he had dwelt in that valley, the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass. The locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of a hangman.\rNevertheless, the Bishop meditated on the subject, and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the Convention, and he said, \"There is a soul yonder which is lonely.\"\rAnd he added, deep in his own mind, \"I owe him a visit.\"\rBut, let us avow it, this idea, which seemed natural at the first blush, appeared to him after a moment's reflection, as strange, impossible, and almost repulsive.\rFor, at bottom, he shared the general impression, and the old member of the Convention inspired him, without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself, with that sentiment which borders on hate, and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement.\rStill, should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil? No. But what a sheep!\rThe good Bishop was perplexed.\rSometimes he set out in that direction; then he returned.\rFinally, the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd, who served the member of the Convention in his hovel, had come in quest of a doctor; that the old wretch was dying, that paralysis was gaining on him, and that he would not live over night.--\"Thank God!\" some added.\rThe Bishop took his staff, put on his cloak, on account of his too threadbare cassock, as we have mentioned, and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon, and set out.\rThe sun was setting, and had almost touched the horizon when the Bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot.\rWith a certain beating of the heart, he recognized the fact that he was near the lair. He strode over a ditch, leaped a hedge, made his way through a fence of dead boughs, entered a neglected paddock, took a few steps with a good deal of boldness, and suddenly, at the extremity of the waste land, and behind lofty brambles, he caught sight of the cavern.\rIt was a very low hut, poor, small, and clean, with a vine nailed against the outside.\rNear the door, in an old wheel-chair, the arm-chair of the peasants, there was a white-haired man, smiling at the sun.\rNear the seated man stood a young boy, the shepherd lad. He was offering the old man a jar of milk.\rWhile the Bishop was watching him, the old man spoke:\r\"Thank you,\" he said, \"I need nothing.\"\rAnd his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child.\rThe Bishop stepped forward.\rAt the sound which he made in walking, the old man turned his head, and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life.\r\"This is the first time since I have been here,\" said he, \"that any one has entered here.\rWho are you, sir?\"\rThe Bishop answered:--\r\"My name is Bienvenu Myriel.\"\r\"Bienvenu Myriel?\rI have heard that name.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639480617, "end": 1639739817, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639739834, "snapshot": "1639480617", "state": "closed", "author": "0x57a456dCC4a5883a027dB76B6F9A1a9ed1A18566", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
