No. But what a sheep!\rThe good Bishop was perplexed.\rSometimes he set out in that direction; then he returned.\rFinally, the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd, who served the member of the Convention in his hovel, had come in quest of a doctor; that the old wretch was dying, that paralysis was gaining on him, and that he would not live over night.--\"Thank God!\" some added.\rThe Bishop took his staff, put on his cloak, on account of his too threadbare cassock, as we have mentioned, and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon, and set out.\rThe sun was setting, and had almost touched the horizon when the Bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot.\rWith a certain beating of the heart, he recognized the fact that he was near the lair. He strode over a ditch, leaped a hedge, made his way through a fence of dead boughs, entered a neglected paddock, took a few steps with a good deal of boldness, and suddenly, at the extremity of the waste land, and behind lofty brambles, he caught sight of the cavern.\rIt was a very low hut, poor, small, and clean, with a vine nailed against the outside.\rNear the door, in an old wheel-chair, the arm-chair of the peasants, there was a white-haired man, smiling at the sun.\rNear the seated man stood a young boy, the shepherd lad. He was offering the old man a jar of milk.\rWhile the Bishop was watching him, the old man spoke:\r\"Thank you,\" he said, \"I need nothing.\"\rAnd his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child.\rThe Bishop stepped forward.\rAt the sound which he made in walking, the old man turned his head, and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life.\r\"This is the first time since I have been here,\" said he, \"that any one has entered here.\rWho are you, sir?\"\rThe Bishop answered:--\r\"My name is Bienvenu Myriel.\"\r\"Bienvenu Myriel?\rI have heard that name.\rAre you the man whom the people call Monseigneur Welcome?\"\r\"I am.\"\rThe old man resumed with a half-smile\r\"In that case, you are my bishop?\"\r\"Something of that sort.\"\r\"Enter, sir.\"\rThe member of the Convention extended his hand to the Bishop, but the Bishop did not take it.\rThe Bishop confined himself to the remark:--\r\"I am pleased to see that I have been misinformed.\rYou certainly do not seem to me to be ill.\"\r\"Monsieur,\" replied the old man, \"I am going to recover.\"\rHe paused, and then said:--\r\"I shall die three hours hence.\"\rThen he continued:--\r\"I am something of a doctor; I know in what fashion the last hour draws on.\rYesterday, only my feet were cold; to-day, the chill has ascended to my knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; when it reaches the heart, I shall stop.\rThe sun is beautiful, is it not?\rI had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things.\rYou can talk to me; it does not fatigue me.\rYou have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death. It is well that there should be witnesses at that moment.\rOne has one's caprices; I should have liked to last until the dawn, but I know that I shall hardly live three hours.\rIt will be night then. What does it matter, after all?\rDying is a simple affair. One has no need of the light for that.\rSo be it.\rI shall die by starlight.\"\rThe old man turned to the shepherd lad:--\r\"Go to thy bed; thou wert awake all last night; thou art tired.\"\rThe child entered the hut.\rThe old man followed him with his eyes, and added, as though speaking to himself:--\r\"I shall die while he sleeps.\rThe two slumbers may be good neighbors.\"\rThe Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He did not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the whole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest:\rhe, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at \"His Grace,\" was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and he was almost tempted to retort \"citizen.\" He was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but which was not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of the Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the powerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably, the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.\rMeanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality, in which one could have distinguished, possibly, that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust.\rThe Bishop, on his side, although he generally restrained his curiosity, which, in his opinion, bordered on a fault, could not refrain from examining the member of the Convention with an attention which, as it did not have its course in sympathy, would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A member of the Convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law, even of the law of charity.\rG----, calm, his body almost upright, his voice vibrating, was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist. The Revolution had many of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof. Though so near to his end, he preserved all the gestures of health. In his clear glance, in his firm tone, in the robust movement of his shoulders, there was something calculated to disconcert death. Azrael, the Mohammedan angel of the sepulchre, would have turned back, and thought that he had mistaken the door.\rG---- seemed to be dying because he willed it so.\rThere was freedom in his agony.\rHis legs alone were motionless.\rIt was there that the shadows held him fast. His feet were cold and dead, but his head survived with all the power of life, and seemed full of light.\rG----, at this solemn moment, resembled the king in that tale of the Orient who was flesh above and marble below.\rThere was a stone there.\rThe Bishop sat down.\rThe exordium was abrupt.\r\"I congratulate you,\" said he, in the tone which one uses for a reprimand.\r\"You did not vote for the death of the king, after all.\"\rThe old member of the Convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words \"after all.\"\rHe replied. The smile had quite disappeared from his face.\r\"Do not congratulate me too much, sir.\rI did vote for the death of the tyrant.\"\rIt was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity.\r\"What do you mean to say?\" resumed the Bishop.\r\"I mean to say that man has a tyrant,--ignorance.\rI voted for the death of that tyrant.\rThat tyrant engendered royalty, which is authority falsely understood, while science is authority rightly understood. Man should be governed only by science.\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639479819, "end": 1639739019, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639739052, "snapshot": "1639479819", "state": "closed", "author": "0x29FB4261530E9a1E5AE076c59807D48fdaFE4358", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
