There is evidently a mistake here.\rThere are thirty-six of you, in five or six small rooms.\rThere are three of us here, and we have room for sixty.\rThere is some mistake, I tell you; you have my house, and I have yours.\rGive me back my house; you are at home here.\"\rOn the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in the Bishop's palace, and the Bishop was settled in the hospital.\rM. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by the Revolution.\rHis sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs, which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage.\rM. Myriel received from the State, in his quality of bishop, a salary of fifteen thousand francs.\rOn the very day when he took up his abode in the hospital, M. Myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all, in the following manner. We transcribe here a note made by his own hand:--\r NOTE ON THE REGULATION OF MY HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.\rFor the little seminary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,500 livres \rSociety of the mission . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100 \" \rFor the Lazarists of Montdidier . . . . . . . . . . 100 \" \rI have Romans, and Roman ladies [here occurs an illegible word], and the whole train. Madam Magloire has cleaned it all off; this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired, and the whole revarnished, and my chamber will be a regular museum.\rShe has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables of ancient fashion. They asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them, but it is much better to give the money to the poor; and they are very ugly besides, and I should much prefer a round table of mahogany.\rI am always very happy.\rMy brother is so good.\rHe gives all he has to the poor and sick.\rWe are very much cramped.\rThe country is trying in the winter, and we really must do something for those who are in need.\rWe are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that these are great treats.\rMy brother has ways of his own.\rWhen he talks, he says that a bishop ought to be so.\rJust imagine! the door of our house is never fastened. Whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother's room. He fears nothing, even at night.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646231, "end": 1639905431, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905441, "snapshot": "1639646231", "state": "closed", "author": "0x55a5D2DDd936A287d53c5c7Cd095656e31CB8Fc0", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
