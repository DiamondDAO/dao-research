Everything else seemed to him very stupid.\rHe was intelligent, and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of Epicurus; while he was, in reality, only a product of Pigault-Lebrun. He laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things, and at the \"Crotchets of that good old fellow the Bishop.\" He even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel himself, who listened to him.\rOn some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect what, Count*** [this senator] and M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect. At dessert, the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, though still perfectly dignified, exclaimed:--\r\"Egad, Bishop, let's have a discussion.\rThis letter is in our possession. \rD----, Dec. 16, 18--. MY GOOD MADAM:\rNot a day passes without our speaking of you. It is our established custom; but there is another reason besides. Just imagine, while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls, Madam Magloire has made some discoveries; now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over, would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours.\rMadam Magloire has pulled off all the paper. There were things beneath.\rMy drawing-room, which contains no furniture, and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing, is fifteen feet in height, eighteen square, with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded, and with beams, as in yours. This was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital. And the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers.\rBut my room is the one you ought to see.\rMadam Magloire has discovered, under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top, some paintings, which without being good are very tolerable.\rThe subject is Telemachus being knighted by Minerva in some gardens, the name of which escapes me.\rIn short, where the Roman ladies repaired on one single night.\rWhat shall I say to you?\rI have Romans, and Roman ladies [here occurs an illegible word], and the whole train. Madam Magloire has cleaned it all off; this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired, and the whole revarnished, and my chamber will be a regular museum.\rShe has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables of ancient fashion. They asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them, but it is much better to give the money to the poor; and they are very ugly besides, and I should much prefer a round table of mahogany.\rI am always very happy.\rMy brother is so good.\rHe gives all he has to the poor and sick.\rWe are very much cramped.\rThe country is trying in the winter, and we really must do something for those who are in need.\rWe are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that these are great treats.\rBesides, he was an atheist, like all the rest of those people.\rGossip of the geese about the vulture.\rWas G---- a vulture after all?\rYes; if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his.\rAs he had not voted for the death of the king, he had not been included in the decrees of exile, and had been able to remain in France.\rHe dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city, far from any hamlet, far from any road, in some hidden turn of a very wild valley, no one knew exactly where.\rHe had there, it was said, a sort of field, a hole, a lair.\rThere were no neighbors, not even passers-by. Since he had dwelt in that valley, the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass. The locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of a hangman.\r\"And conscience,\" added the Bishop.\r\"It is the same thing.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639479842, "end": 1639739042, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639739052, "snapshot": "1639479842", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9a6186a623A68B1ec2F4A3D33e3E6eD583191333", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
