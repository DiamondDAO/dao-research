He exposes himself to all sorts of dangers, and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it.\rOne must know how to understand him.\rHe goes out in the rain, he walks in the water, he travels in winter. He fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters, nor night.\r year he went quite alone into a country of robbers.\rHe would not take us.\rHe was absent for a fortnight.\rOn his return nothing had happened to him; he was thought to be dead, but was perfectly well, and said, \"This is the way I have been robbed!\"\rAnd then he opened a trunk full of jewels, all the jewels of the cathedral of Embrun, which the thieves had given him.\rWhen he returned on that occasion, I could not refrain from scolding him a little, taking care, however, not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise, so that no one might hear me.\rAt first I used to say to myself, \"There are no dangers which will stop him; he is terrible.\"\rNow I have ended by getting used to it. I make a sign to Madam Magloire that she is not to oppose him. He risks himself as he sees fit.\rI carry off Madam Magloire, I enter my chamber, I pray for him and fall asleep.\rI am at ease, because I know that if anything were to happen to him, it would be the end of me.\rI should go to the good God with my brother and my bishop.\rIt has cost Madam Magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences.\rHis legs alone were motionless.\rIt was there that the shadows held him fast. His feet were cold and dead, but his head survived with all the power of life, and seemed full of light.\rG----, at this solemn moment, resembled the king in that tale of the Orient who was flesh above and marble below.\rThere was a stone there.\rThe Bishop sat down.\rThe exordium was abrupt.\r\"I congratulate you,\" said he, in the tone which one uses for a reprimand.\r\"You did not vote for the death of the king, after all.\"\rThe old member of the Convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words \"after all.\"\rHe replied. The smile had quite disappeared from his face.\r\"Do not congratulate me too much, sir.\rI did vote for the death of the tyrant.\"\rHe seized a rod and cleared out the Temple. His scourge, full of lightnings, was a harsh speaker of truths. When he cried, `Sinite parvulos,' he made no distinction between the little children.\rIt would not have embarrassed him to bring together the Dauphin of Barabbas and the Dauphin of Herod.\rInnocence, Monsieur, is its own crown.\rInnocence has no need to be a highness. It is as august in rags as in fleurs de lys.\"\r\"That is true,\" said the Bishop in a low voice.\r\"I persist,\" continued the conventionary G---- \"You have mentioned Louis XVII.\rto me.\rLet us come to an understanding.\rShall we weep for all the innocent, all martyrs, all children, the lowly as well as the exalted?\rclever men have so many ways of imposing on that honest goodman, the people. By the way, I did not hear the sound of your carriage; you have left it yonder, behind the coppice at the fork of the roads, no doubt. I do not know you, I tell you.\rYou have told me that you are the Bishop; but that affords me no information as to your moral personality. In short, I repeat my question.\rWho are you?\rYou are a bishop; that is to say, a prince of the church, one of those gilded men with heraldic bearings and revenues, who have vast prebends,-- the bishopric of D---- fifteen thousand francs settled income, ten thousand in perquisites; total, twenty-five thousand francs,-- who have kitchens, who have liveries, who make good cheer, who eat moor-hens on Friday, who strut about, a lackey before, a lackey behind, in a gala coach, and who have palaces, and who roll in their carriages in the name of Jesus Christ who went barefoot! You are a prelate,--revenues, palace, horses, servants, good table, all the sensualities of life; you have this like the rest, and like the rest, you enjoy it; it is well; but this says either too much or too little; this does not enlighten me upon the intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable intention of bringing wisdom to me.\rTo whom do I speak? Who are you?\"\rThe Bishop hung his head and replied, \"Vermis sum--I am a worm.\"\r\"A worm of the earth in a carriage?\" growled the conventionary.\rIt was the conventionary's turn to be arrogant, and the Bishop's to be humble.\rThe Bishop resumed mildly:--\r\"So be it, sir.\rBut explain to me how my carriage, which is a few paces off behind the trees yonder, how my good table and the moor-hens which I eat on Friday, how my twenty-five thousand francs income, how my palace and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty, and that '93 was not inexorable.\rThe conventionary passed his hand across his brow, as though to sweep away a cloud.\r\"Before replying to you,\" he said, \"I beseech you to pardon me. I have just committed a wrong, sir.\rYou are at my house, you are my guest, I owe you courtesy.\rYou discuss my ideas, and it becomes me to confine myself to combating your arguments.\rYour riches and your pleasures are advantages which I hold over you in the debate; but good taste dictates that I shall not make use of them.\rI promise you to make no use of them in the future.\"\r\"I thank you,\" said the Bishop.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646300, "end": 1639905500, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905531, "snapshot": "1639646300", "state": "closed", "author": "0xFA8c0d020a7A509606E01eE60D2Ca7cd4C916963", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
