There are very few plains and a great many mountains; hardly any roads, as we have just seen; thirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, and two hundred and eighty-five auxiliary chapels.\rTo visit all these is quite a task.\rThe Bishop managed to do it.\rHe went on foot when it was in the neighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, and on a donkey in the mountains.\rThe two old women accompanied him. When the trip was too hard for them, he went alone.\rCHAPTER IV \rWORKS CORRESPONDING TO WORDS \r His conversation was gay and affable.\rHe put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him. When he laughed, it was the laugh of a schoolboy.\rMadame Magloire liked to call him Your Grace [Votre Grandeur]. One day he rose from his arm-chair, and went to his library in search of a book. This book was on one of the upper shelves.\rAs the bishop was rather short of stature, he could not reach it.\r\"Madame Magloire,\" said he, \"fetch me a chair.\rMy greatness [grandeur] does not reach as far as that shelf.\"\rOne of his distant relatives, Madame la Comtesse de Lo, rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating, in his presence, what she designated as \"the expectations\" of her three sons. She had numerous relatives, who were very old and near to death, and of whom her sons were the natural heirs.\rThe youngest of the three was to receive from a grand-aunt a good hundred thousand livres of income; the second was the heir by entail to the title of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather.\rThe Bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts.\rOn one occasion, however, he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual, while Madame de Lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these \"expectations.\"\rShe interrupted herself impatiently: \"Mon Dieu, cousin!\rWhat are you thinking about?\"\rThe guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin, but the person who has created the shadow.\"\rIt will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things:\rI suspect that he obtained it from the Gospel.\rOne day he heard a criminal case, which was in preparation and on the point of trial, discussed in a drawing-room. A wretched man, being at the end of his resources, had coined counterfeit money, out of love for a woman, and for the child which he had had by her. Counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch. The woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man.\rShe was held, but there were no proofs except against her.\rShe alone could accuse her lover, and destroy him by her confession.\rShe denied; they insisted.\rShe persisted in her denial.\rThereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown. He invented an infidelity on the part of the lover, and succeeded, by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented, in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival, and that the man was deceiving her.\rThereupon, exasperated by jealousy, she denounced her lover, confessed all, proved all.\rThe man was ruined.\rHe was shortly to be tried at Aix with his accomplice.\rThey were relating the matter, and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate. By bringing jealousy into play, he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath, he had educed the justice of revenge.\rThe Bishop listened to all this in silence.\rWhen they had finished, he inquired,--\r\"Where are this man and woman to be tried?\"\r\"At the Court of Assizes.\"\rHe went on, \"And where will the advocate of the crown be tried?\"\rA tragic event occurred at D---- A man was condemned to death for murder.\rHe was a wretched fellow, not exactly educated, not exactly ignorant, who had been a mountebank at fairs, and a writer for the public.\rThe town took a great interest in the trial. On the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man, the chaplain of the prison fell ill.\rA priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments.\rThey sent for the cure. It seems that he refused to come, saying, \"That is no affair of mine.\rI have nothing to do with that unpleasant task, and with that mountebank:\rI, too, am ill; and besides, it is not my place.\" This reply was reported to the Bishop, who said, \"Monsieur le Cure is right:\rit is not his place; it is mine.\"\rHe went instantly to the prison, descended to the cell of the \"mountebank,\" called him by name, took him by the hand, and spoke to him. He passed the entire day with him, forgetful of food and sleep, praying to God for the soul of the condemned man, and praying the condemned man for his own.\rHe told him the best truths, which are also the most simple.\rHe was father, brother, friend; he was bishop only to bless.\rHe taught him everything, encouraged and consoled him. The man was on the point of dying in despair.\rDeath was an abyss to him. As he stood trembling on its mournful brink, he recoiled with horror. He was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent. His condemnation, which had been a profound shock, had, in a manner, broken through, here and there, that wall which separates us from the mystery of things, and which we call life.\rHe gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches, and beheld only darkness.\rThe Bishop made him see light.\rOn the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, the Bishop was still there.\rHe followed him, and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639480511, "end": 1639739711, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639739742, "snapshot": "1639480511", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa9D814656C9eb2f8b3BF73b002b7d1b40090b9d9", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
