There is evidently a mistake here.\rThere are thirty-six of you, in five or six small rooms.\rThere are three of us here, and we have room for sixty.\rThis holy woman regarded Monseigneur of D---- as at one and the same time her brother and her bishop, her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the Church. She simply loved and venerated him.\rWhen he spoke, she bowed; when he acted, she yielded her adherence.\rTheir only servant, Madame Magloire, grumbled a little.\rIt will be observed that Monsieur the Bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres, which, added to the pension of Mademoiselle Baptistine, made fifteen hundred francs a year.\rOn these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted.\rAnd when a village curate came to D----, the Bishop still found means to entertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, and to the intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine.\rOne day, after he had been in D---- about three months, the Bishop said:--\r\"And still I am quite cramped with it all!\"\r\"I should think so!\" exclaimed Madame Magloire.\r\"Monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town, and for his journeys about the diocese.\rIt was customary for bishops in former days.\"\r\"Hold!\" cried the Bishop, \"you are quite right, Madame Magloire.\"\rAnd he made his demand.\rSome time afterwards the General Council took this demand under consideration, and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs, under this heading:\rAllowance to M. the Bishop for expenses of carriage, expenses of posting, and expenses of pastoral visits.\rThis provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senator of the Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundred which favored the 18 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of D----, wrote to M. Bigot de Preameneu, the minister of public worship, a very angry and confidential note on the subject, from which we extract these authentic lines:--\r \"Expenses of carriage?\rWhat can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants?\rExpenses of journeys?\rWhat is the use of these trips, in the first place?\rNext, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts?\rThere are no roads. No one travels otherwise than on horseback.\rEven the bridge between Durance and Chateau-Arnoux can barely support ox-teams. These priests are all thus, greedy and avaricious.\rThis man played the good priest when he first came.\rNow he does like the rest; he must have a carriage and a posting-chaise, he must have luxuries, like the bishops of the olden days.\rOh, all this priesthood! Things will not go well, M. le Comte, until the Emperor has freed us from these black-capped rascals.\rDown with the Pope!\r[Matters were getting embroiled with Rome.] For my part, I am for Caesar alone.\" Etc., etc.\r On the other hand, this affair afforded great delight to Madame Magloire. \"Good,\" said she to Mademoiselle Baptistine; \"Monseigneur began with other people, but he has had to wind up with himself, after all. He has regulated all his charities.\rNow here are three thousand francs for us!\rAt last!\"\rThat same evening the Bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a memorandum conceived in the following terms:--\rEXPENSES OF CARRIAGE AND CIRCUIT.\rFor furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital. 1,500 livres \rFor the maternity charitable society of Aix . . . . . . . 250 \" \rFor the maternity charitable society of Draguignan . . . 250 \" \rFor foundlings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500 \" \rFor orphans . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500 \" \rTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,000 \"\r Such was M. Myriel's budget.\rAs for the chance episcopal perquisites, the fees for marriage bans, dispensations, private baptisms, sermons, benedictions, of churches or chapels, marriages, etc., the Bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity, since he bestowed them on the needy.\rAfter a time, offerings of money flowed in.\rThose who had and those who lacked knocked at M. Myriel's door,--the latter in search of the alms which the former came to deposit.\rIn less than a year the Bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress.\rConsiderable sums of money passed through his hands, but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life, or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities.\rFar from it.\rAs there is always more wretchedness below than there is brotherhood above, all was given away, so to speak, before it was received.\rIt was like water on dry soil; no matter how much money he received, he never had any.\rThen he stripped himself.\rThe usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the head of their charges and their pastoral letters, the poor people of the country-side had selected, with a sort of affectionate instinct, among the names and prenomens of their bishop, that which had a meaning for them; and they never called him anything except Monseigneur Bienvenu [Welcome]. We will follow their example, and will also call him thus when we have occasion to name him.\rMoreover, this appellation pleased him.\r\"I like that name,\" said he.\r\"Bienvenu makes up for the Monseigneur.\"\rWe do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable; we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER III \rA HARD BISHOPRIC FOR A GOOD BISHOP\r The Bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms.\rThe diocese of D---- is a fatiguing one. There are very few plains and a great many mountains; hardly any roads, as we have just seen; thirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, and two hundred and eighty-five auxiliary chapels.\rTo visit all these is quite a task.\rThe Bishop managed to do it.\rHe went on foot when it was in the neighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, and on a donkey in the mountains.\rThe two old women accompanied him. When the trip was too hard for them, he went alone.\rOne day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal city. He was mounted on an ass.\rHis purse, which was very dry at that moment, did not permit him any other equipage.\rThe mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town, and watched him dismount from his ass, with scandalized eyes.\rSome of the citizens were laughing around him.\r\"Monsieur the Mayor,\" said the Bishop, \"and Messieurs Citizens, I perceive that I shock you.\rYou think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by Jesus Christ.\rI have done so from necessity, I assure you, and not from vanity.\"\rIn the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent, and talked rather than preached.\rHe never went far in search of his arguments and his examples.\rHe quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of a neighboring district.\rIn the cantons where they were harsh to the poor, he said:\r\"Look at the people of Briancon! They have conferred on the poor, on widows and orphans, the right to have their meadows mown three days in advance of every one else. They rebuild their houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined. Therefore it is a country which is blessed by God.\rFor a whole century, there has not been a single murderer among them.\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639479689, "end": 1639738889, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639738902, "snapshot": "1639479689", "state": "closed", "author": "0x12cFc4a1Cf40ceB7531A240A53c8F3E608B0187C", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
