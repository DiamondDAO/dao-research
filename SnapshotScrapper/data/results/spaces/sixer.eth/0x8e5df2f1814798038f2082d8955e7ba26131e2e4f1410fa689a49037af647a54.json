Naigeon are no rascals. I have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges.\"\r\"Like yourself, Count,\" interposed the Bishop.\rThe senator resumed:--\r\"I hate Diderot; he is an ideologist, a declaimer, and a revolutionist, a believer in God at bottom, and more bigoted than Voltaire. Voltaire made sport of Needham, and he was wrong, for Needham's eels prove that God is useless.\rA drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux.\rSuppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger; you have the world.\rMan is the eel. Then what is the good of the Eternal Father?\rThe Jehovah hypothesis tires me, Bishop.\rIt is good for nothing but to produce shallow people, whose reasoning is hollow.\rDown with that great All, which torments me! Hurrah for Zero which leaves me in peace!\rBetween you and me, and in order to empty my sack, and make confession to my pastor, as it behooves me to do, I will admit to you that I have good sense. I am not enthusiastic over your Jesus, who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity.\r'Tis the counsel of an avaricious man to beggars.\rRenunciation; why?\rSacrifice; to what end? I do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of another wolf.\rLet us stick to nature, then.\rWe are at the top; let us have a superior philosophy.\rWhat is the advantage of being at the top, if one sees no further than the end of other people's noses?\rLet us live merrily.\rLife is all.\rThat man has another future elsewhere, on high, below, anywhere, I don't believe; not one single word of it.\rAh! sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me; I must take heed to everything I do; I must cudgel my brains over good and evil, over the just and the unjust, over the fas and the nefas.\rWhy?\rBecause I shall have to render an account of my actions.\rWhen?\rAfter death.\rWhat a fine dream! After my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me. Have a handful of dust seized by a shadow-hand, if you can. Let us tell the truth, we who are initiated, and who have raised the veil of Isis:\rthere is no such thing as either good or evil; there is vegetation.\rLet us seek the real.\rLet us get to the bottom of it.\rLet us go into it thoroughly.\rWhat the deuce! let us go to the bottom of it!\rWe must scent out the truth; dig in the earth for it, and seize it.\rThen it gives you exquisite joys. Then you grow strong, and you laugh.\rI am square on the bottom, I am.\rImmortality, Bishop, is a chance, a waiting for dead men's shoes.\rAh! what a charming promise! trust to it, if you like! What a fine lot Adam has!\rWe are souls, and we shall be angels, with blue wings on our shoulder-blades. Do come to my assistance: is it not Tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star?\rVery well.\rWe shall be the grasshoppers of the stars. And then, besides, we shall see God.\rTa, ta, ta!\rWhat twaddle all these paradises are!\rGod is a nonsensical monster.\rI would not say that in the Moniteur, egad! but I may whisper it among friends. Inter pocula.\rTo sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow.\rBe the dupe of the infinite! I'm not such a fool.\rI am a nought.\rI call myself Monsieur le Comte Nought, senator.\rDid I exist before my birth?\rNo. Shall I exist after death?\rNo. What am I?\rA little dust collected in an organism. What am I to do on this earth?\rThe choice rests with me: suffer or enjoy.\rWhither will suffering lead me?\rTo nothingness; but I shall have suffered.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639480594, "end": 1639739794, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639739802, "snapshot": "1639480594", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4747964648914Dd4776de8d299b5FAE921c3661f", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
