Here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold: he called it his winter salon.\rIn this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood, and four straw-seated chairs. In addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an antique sideboard, painted pink, in water colors.\rOut of a similar sideboard, properly draped with white napery and imitation lace, the Bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory.\rHis wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D---- had more than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for Monseigneur's oratory; on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor.\r\"The most beautiful of altars,\" he said, \"is the soul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking God.\"\rIn his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an arm-chair, also in straw, in his bedroom.\rWhen, by chance, he received seven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, \ror the general, or the staff of the regiment in garrison, or several pupils from the little seminary, the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and the arm-chair from the bedroom:\rin this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors.\rA room was dismantled for each new guest.\rThis plot, consisting of three or four beds, occupied the Bishop almost as much as did his books.\rHe liked to pass an hour or two there, trimming, hoeing, and making holes here and there in the earth, into which he dropped seeds.\rHe was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him.\rMoreover, he made no pretensions to botany; he ignored groups and consistency; he made not the slightest effort to decide between Tournefort and the natural method; he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons, nor with Jussieu against Linnaeus.\rHe did not study plants; he loved flowers. He respected learned men greatly; he respected the ignorant still more; and, without ever failing in these two respects, he watered his flower-beds every summer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green.\rThe house had not a single door which could be locked.\rThe door of the dining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the cathedral square, had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison.\rThe Bishop had had all this ironwork removed, and this door was never fastened, either by night or by day, with anything except the latch.\rAll that the first passerby had to do at any hour, was to give it a push.\rAt first, the two women had been very much tried by this door, which was never fastened, but Monsieur de D---- had said to them, \"Have bolts put on your rooms, if that will please you.\"\rThey had ended by sharing his confidence, or by at least acting as though they shared it.\rMadame Magloire alone had frights from time to time.\rAs for the Bishop, his thought can be found explained, or at least indicated, in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a Bible, \"This is the shade of difference:\rthe door of the physician should never be shut, the door of the priest should always be open.\"\rOn another book, entitled Philosophy of the Medical Science, he had written this other note:\r\"Am not I a physician like them? I also have my patients, and then, too, I have some whom I call my unfortunates.\"\rAgain he wrote:\r\"Do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you.\rThe very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter.\"\rIt chanced that a worthy cure, I know not whether it was the cure of Couloubroux or the cure of Pompierry, took it into his head to ask him one day, probably at the instigation of Madame Magloire, whether Monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion, to a certain extent, in leaving his door unfastened day and night, at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter, and whether, in short, he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded.\rThe Bishop touched his shoulder, with gentle gravity, and said to him, \"Nisi Dominus custodierit domum, in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam,\" Unless the Lord guard the house, in vain do they watch who guard it.\rThen he spoke of something else.\rHe was fond of saying, \"There is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of dragoons,--only,\" he added, \"ours must be tranquil.\"\r\r\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639480570, "end": 1639739770, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639739802, "snapshot": "1639480570", "state": "closed", "author": "0x071a32fb3C41997af91e83f141aAd6265Ca621b0", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
