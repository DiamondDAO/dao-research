He must watch it, cheek it, repress it, and obey it only at the last extremity.\rThere may be some fault even in this obedience; but the fault thus committed is venial; it is a fall, but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer.\r\"To be a saint is the exception; to be an upright man is the rule. Err, fall, sin if you will, but be upright.\r\"The least possible sin is the law of man.\rNo sin at all is the dream of the angel.\rAll which is terrestrial is subject to sin. Sin is a gravitation.\"\rWhen he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly, and growing angry very quickly, \"Oh! oh!\" he said, with a smile; \"to all appearance, this is a great crime which all the world commits.\rThese are hypocrisies which have taken fright, and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter.\"\rHe was indulgent towards women and poor people, on whom the burden of human society rest.\rHe said, \"The faults of women, of children, of the feeble, the indigent, and the ignorant, are the fault of the husbands, the fathers, the masters, the strong, the rich, and the wise.\"\rHe said, moreover, \"Teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible; society is culpable, in that it does not afford instruction gratis; it is responsible for the night which it produces. This soul is full of shadow; sin is therein committed.\rThe guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin, but the person who has created the shadow.\"\rIt will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things:\rI suspect that he obtained it from the Gospel.\rOne day he heard a criminal case, which was in preparation and on the point of trial, discussed in a drawing-room. A wretched man, being at the end of his resources, had coined counterfeit money, out of love for a woman, and for the child which he had had by her. Counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch. The woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man.\rShe was held, but there were no proofs except against her.\rShe alone could accuse her lover, and destroy him by her confession.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639479701, "end": 1639738901, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639738932, "snapshot": "1639479701", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4E963679A6C4Dd9C751b4111CAB605FE0157e3Ab", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
