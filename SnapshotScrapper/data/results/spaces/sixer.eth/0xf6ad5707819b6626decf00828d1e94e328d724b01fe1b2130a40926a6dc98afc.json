Alas!\rThe work was incomplete, I admit:\rwe demolished the ancient regime in deeds; we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas. To destroy abuses is not sufficient; customs must be modified. The mill is there no longer; the wind is still there.\"\r\"You have demolished.\rIt may be of use to demolish, but I distrust a demolition complicated with wrath.\"\r\"Right has its wrath, Bishop; and the wrath of right is an element of progress.\rIn any case, and in spite of whatever may be said, the French Revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of Christ.\rIncomplete, it may be, but sublime. It set free all the unknown social quantities; it softened spirits, it calmed, appeased, enlightened; it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth.\rIt was a good thing.\rThe French Revolution is the consecration of humanity.\"\rThe Bishop could not refrain from murmuring:--\r\"Yes? '93!\"\rThe member of the Convention straightened himself up in his chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity, and exclaimed, so far as a dying man is capable of exclamation:--\r\"Ah, there you go; '93!\rI was expecting that word.\rA cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years; at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst.\rYou are putting the thunderbolt on its trial.\"\rThe Bishop felt, without, perhaps, confessing it, that something within him had suffered extinction.\rNevertheless, he put a good face on the matter.\rHe replied:--\r\"The judge speaks in the name of justice; the priest speaks in the name of pity, which is nothing but a more lofty justice. A thunderbolt should commit no error.\"\rAnd he added, regarding the member of the Convention steadily the while, \"Louis XVII.?\"\rThe conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the Bishop's arm.\r\"Louis XVII.! let us see.\rFor whom do you mourn? is it for the innocent child? very good; in that case I mourn with you. Is it for the royal child?\rI demand time for reflection. To me, the brother of Cartouche, an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the Place de Greve, until death ensued, for the sole crime of having been the brother of Cartouche, is no less painful than the grandson of Louis XV., an innocent child, martyred in the tower of the Temple, for the sole crime of having been grandson of Louis XV.\"\r\"Monsieur,\" said the Bishop, \"I like not this conjunction of names.\"\r\"Cartouche?\rLouis XV.? To which of the two do you object?\"\rA momentary silence ensued.\rThe Bishop almost regretted having come, and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639479831, "end": 1639739031, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639739052, "snapshot": "1639479831", "state": "closed", "author": "0x022FDb15dCE78737e46C120b8011B5a3A3d4f851", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
