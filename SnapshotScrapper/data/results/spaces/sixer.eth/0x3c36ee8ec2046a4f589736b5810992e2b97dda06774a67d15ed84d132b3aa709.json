Win in the lottery, and behold! you are a clever man.\rHe who triumphs is venerated.\rBe born with a silver spoon in your mouth! everything lies in that.\rBe lucky, and you will have all the rest; be happy, and people will think you great.\rOutside of five or six immense exceptions, which compose the splendor of a century, contemporary admiration is nothing but short-sightedness. Gilding is gold.\rIt does no harm to be the first arrival by pure chance, so long as you do arrive.\rThe common herd is an old Narcissus who adores himself, and who applauds the vulgar herd.\rThat enormous ability by virtue of which one is Moses, Aeschylus, Dante, Michael Angelo, or Napoleon, the multitude awards on the spot, and by acclamation, to whomsoever attains his object, in whatsoever it may consist. Let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy:\rlet a false Corneille compose Tiridate; let a eunuch come to possess a harem; let a military Prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch; let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe-soles for the army of the Sambre-and-Meuse, and construct for himself, out of this cardboard, sold as leather, four hundred thousand francs of income; let a pork-packer espouse usury, and cause it to bring forth seven or eight millions, of which he is the father and of which it is the mother; let a preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl; let the steward of a fine family be so rich on retiring from service that he is made minister of finances,--and men call that Genius, just as they call the face of Mousqueton Beauty, and the mien of Claude Majesty.\rWith the constellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which are made in the soft mire of the puddle by the feet of ducks.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER XIII \rWHAT HE BELIEVED\r We are not obliged to sound the Bishop of D---- on the score of orthodoxy.\rIn the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect.\rThe conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word.\rMoreover, certain natures being given, we admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own.\rWhat did he think of this dogma, or of that mystery?\rThese secrets of the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb, where souls enter naked.\rThe point on which we are certain is, that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case.\rNo decay is possible to the diamond. He believed to the extent of his powers.\r\"Credo in Patrem,\" he often exclaimed.\rMoreover, he drew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience, and which whispers to a man, \"Thou art with God!\"\rThe point which we consider it our duty to note is, that outside of and beyond his faith, as it were, the Bishop possessed an excess of love.\rIn was in that quarter, quia multum amavit,--because he loved much--that he was regarded as vulnerable by \"serious men,\" \"grave persons\" and \"reasonable people\"; favorite locutions of our sad world where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry. What was this excess of love?\rIt was a serene benevolence which overflowed men, as we have already pointed out, and which, on occasion, extended even to things.\rHe lived without disdain. He was indulgent towards God's creation.\rEvery man, even the best, has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves for animals. The Bishop of D---- had none of that harshness, which is peculiar to many priests, nevertheless.\rHe did not go as far as the Brahmin, but he seemed to have weighed this saying of Ecclesiastes:\r\"Who knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth?\"\rHideousness of aspect, deformity of instinct, troubled him not, and did not arouse his indignation.\rHe was touched, almost softened by them. It seemed as though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of life which is apparent, the cause, the explanation, or the excuse for them.\rHe seemed at times to be asking God to commute these penalties.\rHe examined without wrath, and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering a palimpsest, that portion of chaos which still exists in nature.\rThis revery sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings.\rOne morning he was in his garden, and thought himself alone, but his sister was walking behind him, unseen by him:\rsuddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground; it was a large, black, hairy, frightful spider.\rHis sister heard him say:--\r\"Poor beast!\rIt is not its fault!\"\rWhy not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness? Puerile they may be; but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to Saint Francis d'Assisi and of Marcus Aurelius.\rOne day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant. Thus lived this just man.\rSometimes he fell asleep in his garden, and then there was nothing more venerable possible.\rMonseigneur Bienvenu had formerly been, if the stories anent his youth, and even in regard to his manhood, were to be believed, a passionate, and, possibly, a violent man.\rHis universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life, and had trickled there slowly, thought by thought; for, in a character, as in a rock, there may exist apertures made by drops of water. These hollows are uneffaceable; these formations are indestructible.\rIn 1815, as we think we have already said, he reached his seventy-fifth birthday, but he did not appear to be more than sixty.\rHe was not tall; he was rather plump; and, in order to combat this tendency, he was fond of taking long strolls on foot; his step was firm, and his form was but slightly bent, a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion.\rGregory XVI., at the age of eighty, held himself erect and smiling, which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop.\rMonseigneur Welcome had what the people term a \"fine head,\" but so amiable was he that they forgot that it was fine.\rWhen he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms, and of which we have already spoken, people felt at their ease with him, and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person.\rHis fresh and ruddy complexion, his very white teeth, all of which he had preserved, and which were displayed by his smile, gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man, \"He's a good fellow\"; and of an old man, \"He is a fine man.\"\rThat, it will be recalled, was the effect which he produced upon Napoleon.\rOn the first encounter, and to one who saw him for the first time, he was nothing, in fact, but a fine man.\rBut if one remained near him for a few hours, and beheld him in the least degree pensive, the fine man became gradually transfigured, and took on some imposing quality, I know not what; his broad and serious brow, rendered august by his white locks, became august also by virtue of meditation; majesty radiated from his goodness, though his goodness ceased not to be radiant; one experienced something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings, without ceasing to smile.\rRespect, an unutterable respect, penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your heart, and one felt that one had before him one of those strong, thoroughly tried, and indulgent souls where thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle.\rAs we have seen, prayer, the celebration of the offices of religion, alms-giving, the consolation of the afflicted, the cultivation of a bit of land, fraternity, frugality, hospitality, renunciation, confidence, study, work, filled every day of his life.\rFilled is exactly the word; certainly the Bishop's day was quite full to the brim, of good words and good deeds.\rNevertheless, it was not complete if cold or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed, and after the two women had retired. It seemed to be a sort of rite with him, to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646380, "end": 1639905580, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905591, "snapshot": "1639646380", "state": "closed", "author": "0x97Ab76D90898c25C3Ead65751C6ea8CF2db300E1", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
