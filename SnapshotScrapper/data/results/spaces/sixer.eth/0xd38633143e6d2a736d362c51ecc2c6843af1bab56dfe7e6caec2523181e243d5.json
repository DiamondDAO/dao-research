Charles-Francois-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D---- He was an old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied the see of D---- since 1806.\rAlthough this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese.\rTrue or false, that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all in their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar.\rIt was said that his father, destining him to be the heir of his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen or twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it was said that Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk.\rHe was well formed, though rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.\rThe Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation; the parliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were dispersed.\rM. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning of the Revolution.\rThere his wife died of a malady of the chest, from which she had long suffered.\rHe had no children. What took place next in the fate of M. Myriel?\rThe ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fall of his own family, the tragic spectacles of '93, which were, perhaps, even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance, with the magnifying powers of terror,--did these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him?\rWas he, in the midst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life, suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastrophes would not shake, by striking at his existence and his fortune?\rNo one could have told:\rall that was known was, that when he returned from Italy he was a priest.\rIn 1804, M. Myriel was the Cure of B---- [Brignolles]. He was already advanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.\rAbout the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with his curacy--just what, is not precisely known--took him to Paris.\rAmong other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners was M. le Cardinal Fesch.\rOne day, when the Emperor had come to visit his uncle, the worthy Cure, who was waiting in the anteroom, found himself present when His Majesty passed.\rNapoleon, on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man, turned round and said abruptly:--\r\"Who is this good man who is staring at me?\"\r\"Sire,\" said M. Myriel, \"you are looking at a good man, and I at a great man.\rEach of us can profit by it.\"\rThat very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Cure, and some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed Bishop of D----\rWhat truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of M. Myriel's life?\rNo one knew. Very few families had been acquainted with the Myriel family before the Revolution.\rM. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town, where there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think. He was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and because he was a bishop.\rBut after all, the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only,--noise, sayings, words; less than words-- palabres, as the energetic language of the South expresses it.\rHowever that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in D----, all the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion.\rNo one would have dared to mention them; no one would have dared to recall them.\rM. Myriel had arrived at D---- accompanied by an elderly spinster, Mademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his junior.\rTheir only domestic was a female servant of the same age as Mademoiselle Baptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having been the servant of M. le Cure, now assumed the double title of maid to Mademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.\rMademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; she realized the ideal expressed by the word \"respectable\"; for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. She had never been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen. She was a soul rather than a virgin.\rHer person seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever drooping;-- a mere pretext for a soul's remaining on the earth.\rMadame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and bustling; always out of breath,--in the first place, because of her activity, and in the next, because of her asthma.\rOn his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop immediately after a major-general. The mayor and the president paid the first call on him, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the general and the prefect.\rThe installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER II \rM. MYRIEL BECOMES M. WELCOME \rThe episcopal palace of D---- adjoins the hospital.\rThe episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone at the beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology of the Faculty of Paris, Abbe of Simore, who had been Bishop of D---- in 1712.\rThis palace was a genuine seignorial residence. Everything about it had a grand air,--the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms, the chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks encircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens planted with magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superb gallery which was situated on the ground-floor and opened on the gardens, M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, My Lords Charles Brulart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d'Embrun; Antoine de Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendome, Grand Prior of France, Abbe of Saint Honore de Lerins; Francois de Berton de Crillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; Cesar de Sabran de Forcalquier, bishop, Seignor of Glandeve; and Jean Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, preacher in ordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of Senez. The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment; and this memorable date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble.\rThe hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with a small garden.\rThree days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. The visit ended, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house.\r\"Monsieur the director of the hospital,\" said he to him, \"how many sick people have you at the present moment?\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646046, "end": 1639905246, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905261, "snapshot": "1639646046", "state": "closed", "author": "0xE182C3e01AaaD9687Bf6299dD1518aC119FbAb1d", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
