I am going to make a confession to you.\rI have a philosophy of my own.\"\r\"And you are right,\" replied the Bishop.\r\"As one makes one's philosophy, so one lies on it.\rTa, ta, ta!\rWhat twaddle all these paradises are!\rGod is a nonsensical monster.\rI would not say that in the Moniteur, egad! but I may whisper it among friends. Inter pocula.\rTo sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow.\rBe the dupe of the infinite! I'm not such a fool.\rI am a nought.\rI call myself Monsieur le Comte Nought, senator.\rDid I exist before my birth?\rNo. Shall I exist after death?\rNo. What am I?\rA little dust collected in an organism. What am I to do on this earth?\rThe choice rests with me: suffer or enjoy.\rWhither will suffering lead me?\rTo nothingness; but I shall have suffered.\rWhither will enjoyment lead me? To nothingness; but I shall have enjoyed myself.\rMy choice is made. One must eat or be eaten.\rI shall eat.\rIt is better to be the tooth than the grass.\rSuch is my wisdom.\rAfter which, go whither I push thee, the grave-digger is there; the Pantheon for some of us: all falls into the great hole.\rEnd.\rFinis.\rTotal liquidation. This is the vanishing-point. Death is death, believe me. I laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell me on that subject.\rFables of nurses; bugaboo for children; Jehovah for men.\rNo; our to-morrow is the night.\rBeyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness.\rYou have been Sardanapalus, you have been Vincent de Paul--it makes no difference.\rThat is the truth.\rThen live your life, above all things.\rMake use of your _I_ while you have it.\rIn truth, Bishop, I tell you that I have a philosophy of my own, and I have my philosophers.\rI don't let myself be taken in with that nonsense.\rOf course, there must be something for those who are down,--for the barefooted beggars, knife-grinders, and miserable wretches.\rLegends, chimeras, the soul, immortality, paradise, the stars, are provided for them to swallow. They gobble it down.\rThey spread it on their dry bread. He who has nothing else has the good.\rGod.\rThat is the least he can have.\rI oppose no objection to that; but I reserve Monsieur Naigeon for myself.\rThe good God is good for the populace.\"\rThe Bishop clapped his hands.\r\"That's talking!\" he exclaimed.\r\"What an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism!\rNot every one who wants it can have it.\rAh! when one does have it, one is no longer a dupe, one does not stupidly allow one's self to be exiled like Cato, nor stoned like Stephen, nor burned alive like Jeanne d'Arc. Those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible, and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness,--places, sinecures, dignities, power, whether well or ill acquired, lucrative recantations, useful treacheries, savory capitulations of conscience,--and that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished.\rHow agreeable that is! I do not say that with reference to you, senator.\rNevertheless, it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you.\rYou great lords have, so you say, a philosophy of your own, and for yourselves, which is exquisite, refined, accessible to the rich alone, good for all sauces, and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably.\rThis philosophy has been extracted from the depths, and unearthed by special seekers.\rBut you are good-natured princes, and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good God should constitute the philosophy of the people, very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor.\"\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER IX \rTHE BROTHER AS DEPICTED BY THE SISTER\r In order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the Bishop of D----, and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions, their thoughts, their feminine instincts even, which are easily alarmed, to the habits and purposes of the Bishop, without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them, we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter from Mademoiselle Baptistine to Madame the Vicomtess de Boischevron, the friend of her childhood.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639479795, "end": 1639738995, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639739022, "snapshot": "1639479795", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa98fB7c54B9bDed3E17aC9087391082869Db7d30", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
