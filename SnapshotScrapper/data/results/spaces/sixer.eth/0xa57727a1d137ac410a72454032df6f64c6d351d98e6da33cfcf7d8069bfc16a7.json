I have seen them there.\rThey are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cord of their hat.\rThose who teach reading only have one pen; those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens; those who teach reading, reckoning, and Latin have three pens.\rBut what a disgrace to be ignorant!\rDo like the people of Queyras!\"\rThus he discoursed gravely and paternally; in default of examples, he invented parables, going directly to the point, with few phrases and many images, which characteristic formed the real eloquence of Jesus Christ.\rAnd being convinced himself, he was persuasive.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER IV \rWORKS CORRESPONDING TO WORDS \r His conversation was gay and affable.\rHe put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him. When he laughed, it was the laugh of a schoolboy.\rMadame Magloire liked to call him Your Grace [Votre Grandeur]. One day he rose from his arm-chair, and went to his library in search of a book. This book was on one of the upper shelves.\rAs the bishop was rather short of stature, he could not reach it.\r\"Madame Magloire,\" said he, \"fetch me a chair.\rMy greatness [grandeur] does not reach as far as that shelf.\"\rOne of his distant relatives, Madame la Comtesse de Lo, rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating, in his presence, what she designated as \"the expectations\" of her three sons. She had numerous relatives, who were very old and near to death, and of whom her sons were the natural heirs.\rThe youngest of the three was to receive from a grand-aunt a good hundred thousand livres of income; the second was the heir by entail to the title of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather.\rThe Bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts.\rOn one occasion, however, he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual, while Madame de Lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these \"expectations.\"\rShe interrupted herself impatiently: \"Mon Dieu, cousin!\rWhat are you thinking about?\"\r\"I am thinking,\" replied the Bishop, \"of a singular remark, which is to be found, I believe, in St. Augustine,--`Place your hopes in the man from whom you do not inherit.'\"\rAt another time, on receiving a notification of the decease of a gentleman of the country-side, wherein not only the dignities of the dead man, but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives, spread over an entire page:\r\"What a stout back Death has!\" he exclaimed.\r\"What a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him, and how much wit must men have, in order thus to press the tomb into the service of vanity!\"\rHe was gifted, on occasion, with a gentle raillery, which almost always concealed a serious meaning.\rIn the course of one Lent, a youthful vicar came to D----, and preached in the cathedral. He was tolerably eloquent.\rThe subject of his sermon was charity. He urged the rich to give to the poor, in order to avoid hell, which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable, and to win paradise, which he represented as charming and desirable. Among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant, who was somewhat of a usurer, named M. Geborand, who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth, serges, and woollen galloons. Never in his whole life had M. Geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of that sermon, it was observed that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old beggar-women at the door of the cathedral. There were six of them to share it.\rOne day the Bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity, and said to his sister, with a smile, \"There is M. Geborand purchasing paradise for a sou.\"\rWhen it was a question of charity, he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal, and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection.\rOnce he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room of the town; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier, a wealthy and avaricious old man, who contrived to be, at one and the same time, an ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairian. This variety of man has actually existed.\rWhen the Bishop came to him, he touched his arm, \"You must give me something, M. le Marquis.\" The Marquis turned round and answered dryly, \"I have poor people of my own, Monseigneur.\"\r\"Give them to me,\" replied the Bishop.\rOne day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral:--\r \"My very dear brethren, my good friends, there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants' dwellings in France which have but three openings; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings, the door and one window; and three hundred and forty-six thousand cabins besides which have but one opening, the door.\rAnd this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows.\rThe town took a great interest in the trial. On the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man, the chaplain of the prison fell ill.\rA priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments.\rThey sent for the cure. It seems that he refused to come, saying, \"That is no affair of mine.\rI have nothing to do with that unpleasant task, and with that mountebank:\rI, too, am ill; and besides, it is not my place.\" This reply was reported to the Bishop, who said, \"Monsieur le Cure is right:\rit is not his place; it is mine.\"\rHe went instantly to the prison, descended to the cell of the \"mountebank,\" called him by name, took him by the hand, and spoke to him. He passed the entire day with him, forgetful of food and sleep, praying to God for the soul of the condemned man, and praying the condemned man for his own.\rHe told him the best truths, which are also the most simple.\rHe was father, brother, friend; he was bishop only to bless.\rHe taught him everything, encouraged and consoled him. The man was on the point of dying in despair.\rDeath was an abyss to him. As he stood trembling on its mournful brink, he recoiled with horror. He was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent. His condemnation, which had been a profound shock, had, in a manner, broken through, here and there, that wall which separates us from the mystery of things, and which we call life.\rHe gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches, and beheld only darkness.\rThe Bishop made him see light.\rOn the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, the Bishop was still there.\rHe followed him, and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords.\rHe mounted the tumbril with him, he mounted the scaffold with him. The sufferer, who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day, was radiant.\rHe felt that his soul was reconciled, and he hoped in God.\rThe Bishop embraced him, and at the moment when the knife was about to fall, he said to him:\r\"God raises from the dead him whom man slays; he whom his brothers have rejected finds his Father once more.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646084, "end": 1639905284, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905293, "snapshot": "1639646084", "state": "closed", "author": "0x31C0cdBea41f9Eb0cb9998Dc0B52fAaA5BefCfdC", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
