On the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man, the chaplain of the prison fell ill.\rA priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments.\rThey sent for the cure. It seems that he refused to come, saying, \"That is no affair of mine.\rI have nothing to do with that unpleasant task, and with that mountebank:\rI, too, am ill; and besides, it is not my place.\" This reply was reported to the Bishop, who said, \"Monsieur le Cure is right:\rit is not his place; it is mine.\"\rHe went instantly to the prison, descended to the cell of the \"mountebank,\" called him by name, took him by the hand, and spoke to him. He passed the entire day with him, forgetful of food and sleep, praying to God for the soul of the condemned man, and praying the condemned man for his own.\rIn three of these, Madame Magloire cultivated vegetables; in the fourth, the Bishop had planted some flowers; here and there stood a few fruit-trees. Madame Magloire had once remarked, with a sort of gentle malice: \"Monseigneur, you who turn everything to account, have, nevertheless, one useless plot.\rIt would be better to grow salads there than bouquets.\" \"Madame Magloire,\" retorted the Bishop, \"you are mistaken. The beautiful is as useful as the useful.\"\rHe added after a pause, \"More so, perhaps.\"\rThis plot, consisting of three or four beds, occupied the Bishop almost as much as did his books.\rHe liked to pass an hour or two there, trimming, hoeing, and making holes here and there in the earth, into which he dropped seeds.\rHe was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him.\rMoreover, he made no pretensions to botany; he ignored groups and consistency; he made not the slightest effort to decide between Tournefort and the natural method; he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons, nor with Jussieu against Linnaeus.\rHe did not study plants; he loved flowers. He respected learned men greatly; he respected the ignorant still more; and, without ever failing in these two respects, he watered his flower-beds every summer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green.\rThe house had not a single door which could be locked.\rThe door of the dining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the cathedral square, had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison.\rThe Bishop had had all this ironwork removed, and this door was never fastened, either by night or by day, with anything except the latch.\rAll that the first passerby had to do at any hour, was to give it a push.\rAt first, the two women had been very much tried by this door, which was never fastened, but Monsieur de D---- had said to them, \"Have bolts put on your rooms, if that will please you.\"\rA flock of wolves!\"\r\"Monsieur le maire, it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that Jesus has constituted me the shepherd.\rWho knows the ways of Providence?\"\r\"They will rob you, Monseigneur.\"\r\"I have nothing.\"\r\"They will kill you.\"\r\"An old goodman of a priest, who passes along mumbling his prayers? Bah!\rTo what purpose?\"\r\"Oh, mon Dieu! what if you should meet them!\"\r\"I should beg alms of them for my poor.\"\r\"Do not go, Monseigneur.\rIn the name of Heaven!\rYou are risking your life!\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639479760, "end": 1639738960, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639738992, "snapshot": "1639479760", "state": "closed", "author": "0x36978f702E340fB59EE043381eeF093bEF88d8d6", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
