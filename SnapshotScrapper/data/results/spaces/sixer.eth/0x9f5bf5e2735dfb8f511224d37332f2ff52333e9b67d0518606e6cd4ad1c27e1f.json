It consisted of very handsome things, very tempting things, and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate.\rStolen they had already been elsewhere. Half of the adventure was completed; it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor.\rHowever, we make no assertions on this point.\rOnly, a rather obscure note was found among the Bishop's papers, which may bear some relation to this matter, and which is couched in these terms, \"The question is, to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital.\"\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER VIII \rPHILOSOPHY AFTER DRINKING \rAfter all, what is there for us to fear in this house?\rThere is always some one with us who is stronger than we.\rThe devil may pass through it, but the good God dwells here.\rThis suffices me.\rMy brother has no longer any need of saying a word to me.\rI understand him without his speaking, and we abandon ourselves to the care of Providence.\rThat is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul.\rI have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the Faux family.\rYou are aware that he knows everything, and that he has memories, because he is still a very good royalist.\rThey really are a very ancient Norman family of the generalship of Caen.\rFive hundred years ago there was a Raoul de Faux, a Jean de Faux, and a Thomas de Faux, who were gentlemen, and one of whom was a seigneur de Rochefort. The last was Guy-Etienne-Alexandre, and was commander of a regiment, and something in the light horse of Bretagne.\rHis daughter, Marie-Louise, married Adrien-Charles de Gramont, son of the Duke Louis de Gramont, peer of France, colonel of the French guards, and lieutenant-general of the army.\rIt is written Faux, Fauq, and Faoucq.\rGood Madame, recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative, Monsieur the Cardinal.\rAs for your dear Sylvanie, she has done well in not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me.\rShe is well, works as you would wish, and loves me.\rThat is all that I desire.\rThe souvenir which she sent through you reached me safely, and it makes me very happy.\rMy health is not so very bad, and yet I grow thinner every day.\rFarewell; my paper is at an end, and this forces me to leave you.\rA thousand good wishes. \r BAPTISTINE.\r P.S. Your grand nephew is charming.\rDo you know that he will soon be five years old?\rYesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback who had on knee-caps, and he said, \"What has he got on his knees?\" He is a charming child!\rHis little brother is dragging an old broom about the room, like a carriage, and saying, \"Hu!\"\r As will be perceived from this letter, these two women understood how to mould themselves to the Bishop's ways with that special feminine genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself. The Bishop of D----, in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him, sometimes did things that were grand, bold, and magnificent, without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact. They trembled, but they let him alone.\rSometimes Madame Magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance, but never at the time, nor afterwards. They never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign, in any action once entered upon.\rAt certain moments, without his having occasion to mention it, when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability, so perfect was his simplicity, they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop; then they were nothing more than two shadows in the house.\rThey served him passively; and if obedience consisted in disappearing, they disappeared. They understood, with an admirable delicacy of instinct, that certain cares may be put under constraint.\rThus, even when believing him to be in peril, they understood, I will not say his thought, but his nature, to such a degree that they no longer watched over him. They confided him to God.\rMoreover, Baptistine said, as we have just read, that her brother's end would prove her own.\rMadame Magloire did not say this, but she knew it.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER X \rTHE BISHOP IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNKNOWN LIGHT\r At an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the preceding pages, he did a thing which, if the whole town was to be believed, was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains infested with bandits.\rIn the country near D---- a man lived quite alone.\rThis man, we will state at once, was a former member of the Convention. His name was G----\rMember of the Convention, G---- was mentioned with a sort of horror in the little world of D---- A member of the Convention--can you imagine such a thing?\rAre you the man whom the people call Monseigneur Welcome?\"\r\"I am.\"\rThe old man resumed with a half-smile\r\"In that case, you are my bishop?\"\r\"Something of that sort.\"\r\"Enter, sir.\"\rThe member of the Convention extended his hand to the Bishop, but the Bishop did not take it.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639480629, "end": 1639739829, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639739862, "snapshot": "1639480629", "state": "closed", "author": "0x491b57f608bA44A6e19BAb0C772660dFbDFf9791", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
