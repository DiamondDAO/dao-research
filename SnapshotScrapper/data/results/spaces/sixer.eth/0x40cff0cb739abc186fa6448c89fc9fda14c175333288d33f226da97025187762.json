It is well that there should be witnesses at that moment.\rOne has one's caprices; I should have liked to last until the dawn, but I know that I shall hardly live three hours.\rIt will be night then. What does it matter, after all?\rDying is a simple affair. One has no need of the light for that.\rSo be it.\rI shall die by starlight.\"\rThe old man turned to the shepherd lad:--\r\"Go to thy bed; thou wert awake all last night; thou art tired.\"\rThe child entered the hut.\rThe old man followed him with his eyes, and added, as though speaking to himself:--\r\"I shall die while he sleeps.\rThe two slumbers may be good neighbors.\"\rThe Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He did not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the whole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest:\rhe, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at \"His Grace,\" was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and he was almost tempted to retort \"citizen.\" He was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but which was not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of the Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the powerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably, the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.\rMeanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality, in which one could have distinguished, possibly, that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust.\rIt may be of use to demolish, but I distrust a demolition complicated with wrath.\"\r\"Right has its wrath, Bishop; and the wrath of right is an element of progress.\rIn any case, and in spite of whatever may be said, the French Revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of Christ.\rIncomplete, it may be, but sublime. It set free all the unknown social quantities; it softened spirits, it calmed, appeased, enlightened; it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth.\rIt was a good thing.\rThe French Revolution is the consecration of humanity.\"\rThe Bishop could not refrain from murmuring:--\r\"Yes? '93!\"\rThe member of the Convention straightened himself up in his chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity, and exclaimed, so far as a dying man is capable of exclamation:--\r\"Ah, there you go; '93!\rI was expecting that word.\rA cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years; at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst.\rYou are putting the thunderbolt on its trial.\"\rThe Bishop felt, without, perhaps, confessing it, that something within him had suffered extinction.\rNevertheless, he put a good face on the matter.\rHe replied:--\r\"The judge speaks in the name of justice; the priest speaks in the name of pity, which is nothing but a more lofty justice. A thunderbolt should commit no error.\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639480654, "end": 1639739854, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639739862, "snapshot": "1639480654", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7F77fc5A875B23ee9e3a1105955E2fAf364272c4", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
