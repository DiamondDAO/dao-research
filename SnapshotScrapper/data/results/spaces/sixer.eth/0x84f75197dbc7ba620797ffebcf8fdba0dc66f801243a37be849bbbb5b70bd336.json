The lamp illuminated him on one side, the firelight on the other. They examined him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack.\rThe host said to him, \"There is the fire.\rThe supper is cooking in the pot.\rCome and warm yourself, comrade.\"\rHe approached and seated himself near the hearth.\rHe stretched out his feet, which were exhausted with fatigue, to the fire; a fine odor was emitted by the pot.\rAll that could be distinguished of his face, beneath his cap, which was well pulled down, assumed a vague appearance of comfort, mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual suffering bestows.\rIt was, moreover, a firm, energetic, and melancholy profile. This physiognomy was strangely composed; it began by seeming humble, and ended by seeming severe.\rThe eye shone beneath its lashes like a fire beneath brushwood.\rOne of the men seated at the table, however, was a fishmonger who, before entering the public house of the Rue de Chaffaut, had been to stable his horse at Labarre's. It chanced that he had that very morning encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between Bras d'Asse and--I have forgotten the name. I think it was Escoublon.\rNow, when he met him, the man, who then seemed already extremely weary, had requested him to take him on his crupper; to which the fishmonger had made no reply except by redoubling his gait.\rThis fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded Jacquin Labarre, and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the Cross of Colbas.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646431, "end": 1639905631, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905651, "snapshot": "1639646431", "state": "closed", "author": "0xCb9Bd1D87C0AEe002691aB7dec4Ba1b893B6e133", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
