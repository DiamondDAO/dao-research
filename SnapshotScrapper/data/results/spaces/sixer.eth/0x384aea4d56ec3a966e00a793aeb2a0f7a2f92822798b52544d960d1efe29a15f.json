The man was on the point of dying in despair.\rDeath was an abyss to him. As he stood trembling on its mournful brink, he recoiled with horror. He was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent. His condemnation, which had been a profound shock, had, in a manner, broken through, here and there, that wall which separates us from the mystery of things, and which we call life.\rHe gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches, and beheld only darkness.\rThe Bishop made him see light.\rOn the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, the Bishop was still there.\rHe followed him, and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords.\rHe mounted the tumbril with him, he mounted the scaffold with him. The sufferer, who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day, was radiant.\rHe felt that his soul was reconciled, and he hoped in God.\rThe Bishop embraced him, and at the moment when the knife was about to fall, he said to him:\r\"God raises from the dead him whom man slays; he whom his brothers have rejected finds his Father once more.\rPray, believe, enter into life:\rMademoiselle Baptistine's ambition had been to be able to purchase a set of drawing-room furniture in yellow Utrecht velvet, stamped with a rose pattern, and with mahogany in swan's neck style, with a sofa.\rBut this would have cost five hundred francs at least, and in view of the fact that she had only been able to lay by forty-two francs and ten sous for this purpose in the course of five years, she had ended by renouncing the idea.\rHowever, who is there who has attained his ideal?\rNothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the Bishop's bedchamber.\rA glazed door opened on the garden; opposite this was the bed,--a hospital bed of iron, with a canopy of green serge; in the shadow of the bed, behind a curtain, were the utensils of the toilet, which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world: there were two doors, one near the chimney, opening into the oratory; the other near the bookcase, opening into the dining-room. The bookcase was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books; the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble, and habitually without fire. In the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron, ornamented above with two garlanded vases, and flutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf, which was a sort of episcopal luxury; above the chimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper, with the silver worn off, fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen; near the glass door a large table with an inkstand, loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes; before the table an arm-chair of straw; in front of the bed a prie-Dieu, borrowed from the oratory.\rTwo portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of the bed.\rSmall gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented, one the Abbe of Chaliot, bishop of Saint Claude; the other, the Abbe Tourteau, vicar-general of Agde, abbe of Grand-Champ, order of Citeaux, diocese of Chartres.\rWhen the Bishop succeeded to this apartment, after the hospital patients, he had found these portraits there, and had left them.\rThey were priests, and probably donors--two reasons for respecting them.\rAll that he knew about these two persons was, that they had been appointed by the king, the one to his bishopric, the other to his benefice, on the same day, the 27th of April, 1785.\rMadame Magloire having taken the pictures down to dust, the Bishop had discovered these particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper, yellowed by time, and attached to the back of the portrait of the Abbe of Grand-Champ with four wafers.\rAt his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff, which finally became so old, that, in order to avoid the expense of a new one, Madame Magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it.\rThis seam took the form of a cross. The Bishop often called attention to it:\r\"How delightful that is!\" he said.\rAll the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals.\rHowever, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over, paintings, ornamenting the apartment of Mademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall see further on. Before becoming a hospital, this house had been the ancient parliament house of the Bourgeois.\rHence this decoration. The chambers were paved in red bricks, which were washed every week, with straw mats in front of all the beds.\rAltogether, this dwelling, which was attended to by the two women, was exquisitely clean from top to bottom.\rThis was the sole luxury which the Bishop permitted. He said, \"That takes nothing from the poor.\"\rIt must be confessed, however, that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle, which Madame Magloire contemplated every day with delight, as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth. And since we are now painting the Bishop of D---- as he was in reality, we must add that he had said more than once, \"I find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes.\"\rTo this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver, which he had inherited from a great-aunt. These candlesticks held two wax candles, and usually figured on the Bishop's chimney-piece. When he had any one to dinner, Madame Magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table.\rIn the Bishop's own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was a small cupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night. But it is necessary to add, that the key was never removed.\rThe garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned, was composed of four alleys in cross-form, radiating from a tank.\rAnother walk made the circuit of the garden, and skirted the white wall which enclosed it.\rThese alleys left behind them four square plots rimmed with box.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639479749, "end": 1639738949, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639738962, "snapshot": "1639479749", "state": "closed", "author": "0xdB88ff4139c368F6B16F1880dc830866dc36f705", "space": {"id": "sixer.eth", "name": "SIXER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
