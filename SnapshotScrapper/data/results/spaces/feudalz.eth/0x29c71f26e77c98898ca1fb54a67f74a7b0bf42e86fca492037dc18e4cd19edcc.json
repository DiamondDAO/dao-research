We have been listening to our community stating a misunderstanding on the % of some traits and how they should reflect in their **GOLDZ production bonus.**\n\nThe GOLDZ production system, as it stands, works based on the Rarity Sniper rarity %, which gives us exact numbers.\n\nThis proposal which will be voted on by the community, seeks to change from Rarity Sniper to OpenSea's rarities %, which would be rounded down to the nearest whole number. This means that a few traits would have an increase on **GOLDZ production bonus.**\n\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThe Feudalz team formally petitions all Holders to vote YES or NO on this Switch.\n\nIf majority vote for Yes, we are going to match OpenSea %\nIf majority vote for NO, we are going to keep as it is, using Rarity Sniper %.", "choices": ["YES", "NO"], "start": 1638460800, "end": 1638633600, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638633630, "snapshot": "13729791", "state": "closed", "author": "0xC00f4b8022e4DC7f086D703328247cb6aDF26858", "space": {"id": "feudalz.eth", "name": "Feudalz"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
