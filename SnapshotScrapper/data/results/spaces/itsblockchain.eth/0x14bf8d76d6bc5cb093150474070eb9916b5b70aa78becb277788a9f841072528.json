It will generate lots of yield in future with resources. There will be it\u2019s own game within using Axies to fight off Chimera. Axies travelling across (more on this later) land can also drop bit of their \u2018loot\u2019 for land owners. Future plans are land-owners also able to host own mini-games (using Lunacia SDK) of their choice on-site for more earnings or increase land use. More can be read in whitepaper https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/gameplay/land Speculations are Axies may be burned to enhance land too.\n\nLunacia world has 5 types of Land. 1st round of land sales long over and many now priced well above original price and steadily rising. Proximity to Nodes (Pink in map) which are resources is important. Proximity to better land eg Artic also desirable. Being close to or at roadside also means less travel time (and likely reduced time to gather resources). Possible water (blue) also plays a role and some players think proximity to water also helpful.\n\n                  Floor             Roadside    Nearer to Node\nSavannah 3.445            3.478          3.69\n\nForest        4.5                4.999        4.65\n\nArtic           6.41              7.5              7.964\n\nMystic        17.57             20             17.57\n\nGenesis      530             1337\n\nAs you can see from prices, we can discount Genesis land as way too expensive. I think Mystic is too, even for a DAO. For remaining, I believe Artic is best value. Let me explain why:\n\nApprox. 25 Million AXS tokens to be distributed as P2E within 1st 12 months Land Gameplay. 17,200 Plots in Quadrant 1. Allocation between land and non-land owners. If majority (70%) goes to land owners, the 17.5M means over 1000 AXS per land plot on average. Current prices makes it (modified today prices which is well below due current down for entire market), over $10k.\n\nAbove Discord post explains likely source of AXS to land owners in future. Bear in mind it is not official and simply mathematical speculation of a user. ( see Word Doc for actual message, summarised above)\n\nA savvy Axie Manager I know calculated this and worked out the following breakdown:\n\n                  Rarity land types\nSavannah    2.6\n\nForest          8.32\n\nArtic            23.4\n\nMystic        52\n\nGenesis      1040\n\nNumbers are approximate AXS by land types, from Savannah to Genesis based on rarity. So Forest is over 3X sav, and Artic is 3x forest. If we divide by the floor price of each we get this:\n\nSavannah 0.578\n\nForest      1.546\n\nArtic        3.273\n\nMystic     2.62\n\nGenesis  1.664\n\nBased on above, Arctic is best returns in AXS based on prices relative to rarity. It should return over 250% APY based on current floor price (which may be higher if AXS worth even more by time Land gameplay released). I would recommend by roadside (floor 7.5 ETH) but any land is good.\n\nNote assumptions have been made that out of 25 million, only half is distributed to land owners. It also accounts for that 6 months after launch there will be additional land sale, and then rewards go down because double the land. Future land sales price is said to be about the market price of land at the time of launch. Also SDK will only be allowed in these Q1 lands so such Origin Lands will likely always be worth more.\n\nMore details and original pics on document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gLCHG8KR636AlCYa0GQ47uI_GwVPlt0Xfy-aCmBwRmw/edit?usp=sharing\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1639671780, "end": 1639844580, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [23, 0], "scores_total": 23, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1639844611, "snapshot": "13817226", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9F222c4533507c1a5E986F03F6fA3d5321f04B08", "space": {"id": "itsblockchain.eth", "name": "IBCDAO"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x2c3af53bc46f482c09447604318a79202be96020060b5101f8a81bbb615189ed", "voter": "0xdD8Fa729A39441985Cf7c9bD77849f19DBE00bdc", "created": 1639733145, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "itsblockchain.eth"}}, {"id": "0xa24492fe3387b4daedbf2a696e3b9db50e47082a6c8b107dfe7f65a9058fbb58", "voter": "0xC6579e1C7797EEdcCc36E354907Be27455723b45", "created": 1639726633, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "itsblockchain.eth"}}, {"id": "0xae61ce911d8fd885399631400259e1c606bf48e70814ccc5fedf4320961a2e2d", "voter": "0x203f6Ae819ebF47C9ae014038F15dE685BFEcB8D", "created": 1639717130, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "itsblockchain.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeeHWauMCK1kNpBs295ebJGK5acYf2NtvaFn6Y1bGqpRu", "voter": "0xf8Efb7853b59D5e1dE081A11071B267d49408154", "created": 1639685707, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "itsblockchain.eth"}}, {"id": "0x49ab7ea782ef8ad7e897ee4f853017ce6b586df45925d6573ef361251018c12f", "voter": "0x70F0bBBB3488e17b93b2D3ede0BED4EE67c9cfCc", "created": 1639683223, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "itsblockchain.eth"}}, {"id": "0xbe9cb506bd5de67a88f61f63d6112c92929f92747678cc38cb55321050a190b6", "voter": "0xc6B31d3A7b6b02e0EA9EeA1FDf5320c4384B0FeD", "created": 1639678045, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "itsblockchain.eth"}}, {"id": "0xf7f3995778ab0a86ca5bd344c96c4c340b2aa26eae08619f00db9baed3cf3fb0", "voter": "0xFebC684e1Aa4DD9f2e8B6cF59BFf134468a40D61", "created": 1639677266, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "itsblockchain.eth"}}, {"id": "0x9db298fa7698368fc57f5ab858def5dba7fe15ab127566ee9cb9a6df67779956", "voter": "0x9fc181b94d47dE12219D4d9e8D71F0fcd3e13f2B", "created": 1639676856, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "itsblockchain.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc1bffcfa453caf2384fde72b4d4ecdeee0947209036aa657c90fa4ac12da13cf", "voter": "0x2FC3e601B78040D2Fb18aCcaf84D3555635E1829", "created": 1639675130, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "itsblockchain.eth"}}, {"id": "0xa066d11168cbac3311d70263285645eae10be5a32bad590786afc29aeded5252", "voter": "0x76d3F33d90d8D5c09Fa0aa2036ef6885624c3a3C", "created": 1639674708, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "itsblockchain.eth"}}, {"id": "0x3778dc4a3c50dc3dd526defc958d251760631203e74bdd4cf9d2efe4b4db5bb9", "voter": "0xDb3b203AC9561d25470B8a1267e1593f9636d653", "created": 1639674423, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "itsblockchain.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb8ae79f2072c2d0c3852880d8115707bb9d2c92cdaa05bc1c69112c6ebf451ac", "voter": "0x40b2Ac4cf61C5b4Cc69560D5E80DC74BA2b7a552", "created": 1639672745, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "itsblockchain.eth"}}, {"id": "0x90e8e00e8565b2bb73e4f48d48d26eb61eb95367619c883801832d21389baf76", "voter": "0x9F222c4533507c1a5E986F03F6fA3d5321f04B08", "created": 1639672289, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "itsblockchain.eth"}}]}
