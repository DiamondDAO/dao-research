The only function they will perform is changing the admin, which should not happen often if ever. This multisig contains many high profile and trusted names in the ethereum community and is the safest place to put the ENS in my opinion.\nI propose creating a \u201cgov council\u201d of the five full time Ballers mentioned above. A majority vote in favor would be required before a proposal can be posted to snapshot. I can create a discord channel that is public read-only where the five of us will discuss if a proposal has reached soft consensus. It is extremely important to understand that it is not a question of if any of the five personally are in favor of a proposal, but that the community has reached a soft consensus to proceed. For example, if I personally oppose something but it is clear from forum discussion that most people are in favor, I would be obligated to vote in favor of the proposal going to snapshot.\nAdditionally, I suggest adding a requirement that each proposal include a forum poll as another signaling device we can use. It is gameable of course, but still a valuable input to have I think.\n", "choices": ["yes", "no", "anyway todamoon"], "start": 1637553600, "end": 1637812800, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0.3665235084641954, 50.0261], "scores_total": 50.3926235084642, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1637812934, "snapshot": "13662818", "state": "closed", "author": "0x142Ba743cf9317eB54ba10c157870Af3cBb66bD3", "space": {"id": "freeboy.eth", "name": "GitcoinChina"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xe939626f974d6cfaf3fd48cac3914b70ac41b9d8d346a8105a268b156d4c3b70", "voter": "0xCAa7226794c400F3baf74cAd99748FB68A4a5bD6", "created": 1637561657, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "freeboy.eth"}}, {"id": "0xfb58b9ba5618b355372cc8f1ff817251154e5e5415e90973544bde5d0cf24b5d", "voter": "0x142Ba743cf9317eB54ba10c157870Af3cBb66bD3", "created": 1637561619, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "freeboy.eth"}}]}
