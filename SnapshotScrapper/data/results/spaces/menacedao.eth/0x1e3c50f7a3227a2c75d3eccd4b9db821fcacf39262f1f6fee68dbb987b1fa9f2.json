The proceeds of a Foun sale are sent to the founs multi-sig treasury wallet.  Owning a foun entitles the holder to one vote on how the treasury will be used. Founder, aka Founders, are rewarded with every 10th NFT for the first 5 years (#10, #20, etc)\n\n- 1 foun trustlessly auctioned every 24 hours, forever\n- 100% of foun auction proceeds are trustlessly sent to Founs DAO treasury\n- settlement of one auction kicks off the next\n- all founs (the NFT) are members of Founs DAO\n- Founs DAO uses a fork of\u00a0[Compound Governance](https://compound.finance/governance)\n- 1 Foun = 1 vote\n- treasury is controlled exclusively by founs via governance\n- artwork is generative and stored directly on-chain (not IPFS)\n- no explicit rules for attribute scarcity, all founs are equally rare\n- 'Foun-ders' receive rewards in the form of founs (10% of supply for first 5 years)\n\n## How will this generate revenue for FMD?\n\n- The FMD Multisig will be given 2 shares of the Founder rewards. This will allow FMD to have greater control of governance, and the potential to liquidate rewards for FTM to be shared amongst FMD members.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\n- Create demand for NFT's in the Fantom Ecosystem using an already-established NFT model.\n- Create revenue for FMD.\n- Raise the profile of FMD in the community, by creating the first fork of an already successful ETH project.\n\n## Owners and their responsibilities\n\nThis is a list of tasks across multiple domains: \n\n- Arshankhanifar - dev (frontend / contracts)\n- fantomsaint - dev / marketing\n- July - dev\n- NaturalVoids - Artist / design / marketing\n- merlyn - design\n\n## Timeline\n\nExpected timeline : ~3 weeks\n\n- 1 week for bringing the forking existing Nouns-monorepo project and getting it up and running on Testnet\n- 1 week for setting up and launching / and doing marketing\n- 1 week for buffer and cleaning up bugs and launching\n\n## Project cost\n\n- Owners will be compensated a total of 5,000 FTM for delivering the project, to be paid by the Fantom Menace DAO treasury multi-sig wallet\n- 1,000 FTM per owner will be paid out. There are 5 owners. Payment will be made upon FounsDAO daily auction commencement.\n- FMD is investing in this project, and expects the 5,000 FTM to be repaid by FounsDAO within 365 days of Founs DAO auction commencement by the Founders Reward Multi-sig wallet\n\n## Foun-ders\n\n- 0xJuly (0x144154AB002484f12bFa2Ba784A19BB4814C91cf)\n- Arshankhanifar (0x8216dF2ED694eef1ED9fa9CAfc01DD9349B7C6ad)\n- fantomsaint (0xaa5473262dBfC0E6A010E5a0896952D6657Eb3c2)\n- NaturalVoids (0x2377eB3Fc4366aE614cBe7848e20d55E6a83535e)\n- Merlyn (0xd6E563bb9589629A7a9c0b829122f0aA5A0483bC)\n- FMD (0xce427e37f5888565e8a4c4c8110c99F81e7a5350)", "choices": ["Yes", "No", "Abstain"], "start": 1637944809, "end": 1638376809, "type": "approval", "scores": [10000, 0, 0], "scores_total": 10000, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638376843, "snapshot": "23104685", "state": "closed", "author": "0xaa5473262dBfC0E6A010E5a0896952D6657Eb3c2", "space": {"id": "menacedao.eth", "name": "Fantom Menace DAO"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x43a5e8e83b6a958a2d17cb3298867c1c353348b1000f99199fc35b2ad4a1b585", "voter": "0xE728D41B8ED8f3033e4a9eB92B4429c4dC99A3D9", "created": 1638300764, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "menacedao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0e61acb41f4076521797b99e8859c1824a3629ca23eb60f935ce3aa007038831", "voter": "0x5CB97ec856d779cF7b130408D18CC802824ccf5F", "created": 1638285903, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "menacedao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc8628def73d95ab3ae590645d070aa59af3c05e2272298cd8e6c8a2b997f3976", "voter": "0x4977815A956BdB080887830fC4fC84B720E063E1", "created": 1638237301, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "menacedao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x006888e8b3c9b6aecdea6791ac7433a2f49be8e023e37c61a9b0650d9297a9f1", "voter": "0x5bFaad4A04Ab0Fab6d206c9ea1144da886d31f9a", "created": 1638236414, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "menacedao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x275fb8892c2e801d23a998ba82a8bffae7b7a6b0fd12648ad89ed1a341fc9efa", "voter": "0x1Ad106D14dFE3292163A4086d124fd7f830ec7e3", "created": 1638235304, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "menacedao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x96aabff85ef0f443e01c99f2067ad0407a166fc8782ba57515c6610cd0d68217", "voter": "0xb0FabE3bCAC50F065DBF68C0B271118DDC005402", "created": 1638232789, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "menacedao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xff0495853ab139cbabe08a71cfee6df78b57069888fac93e4bfbb100b3cb221a", "voter": "0xB78935F38DB399E1e45A6A9A2E760B3896ea754e", "created": 1638211311, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "menacedao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x4883a74d934318123063f35e8b03011d16fbd8257444ea54f396c72c7c903f95", "voter": "0x144154AB002484f12bFa2Ba784A19BB4814C91cf", "created": 1638066924, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "menacedao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0af5ba66978f4474c074bc8bfb2c81101d6751572a1438bbd2c0ff45b8beafea", "voter": "0xaa5473262dBfC0E6A010E5a0896952D6657Eb3c2", "created": 1637956726, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "menacedao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1ff76c6811dc892e38a5b7d2b74280822abcb33a5ae5cef24d7fb48f3cd2a6a2", "voter": "0xA1cD7B75cAc5045f476AE865643F4Cf66aEf76d7", "created": 1637951469, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "menacedao.eth"}}]}
