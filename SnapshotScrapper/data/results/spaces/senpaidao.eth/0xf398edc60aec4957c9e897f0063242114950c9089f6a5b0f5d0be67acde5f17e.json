Despite the effort put into founding this DAO and future plans to participate, the Genesis team does not have a SENPAI allocation or have been compensated in any way. There was no token sale, Senpaiswap has no VC backing.\n\nThis proposal is meant to decide if the Senpaiswap Genesis team should be awarded any SENPAI tokens.\n\nOver the course of the last few days, the community has engaged in a very thorough discussion on how much of an allocation the Genesis team should receive, how long tokens should be vested for, and proposed their own ideas for a path forward. We have distilled the communities discussion down to the 2 top ideas that were shown support, via straw polls or positive feedback in the Discord.\n\nThe first option is a standard compensation package, with the second option being more of a radical proposition by a community member that garnered a lot of support.\n\nSenpaiswap has always intended to be a multi-chain protocol - as mentioned in the last medium post, Senpai is planing to deploy on its second chain sometime in the near future. It was therefore suggested to re-focus Senpais attention on the second chain.\n\nThe idea is focusing Senpai\u2019s attention on another chain would act like a fresh start, and could be the potential spark we need to get the protocol going in the right direction. This, of course, does not mean that Senpai would be leaving Boba, just re-shifting its focus in the short term to capture the upside that another, more liquid, chain has to offer.\n\nIf this option is chosen we will deploy to the new chain within a week of the voting. In addition, with this option we would use the stable coins in the treasury to compensate the team as it would put the least amount of downward pressure on SENPAI during the migration, but still allow for the team to be compensated and runway to on board more team members.\n\nSenpaiswap is a community run project, whatever the community votes for in this poll will be respected and executed.\n\nOption 1: Standard Compensation Package agreed on by the community of 100K SENPAI, 20% immediate unlock with the rest vested for 3 months. Boba Network continues to be Senpaiswaps focus.\n\nOption 2: Re-focus Senpaiswaps attention in the near term to a new chain, migrate to the new chain within a week, and use the stables from the treasury to compensate team and fund operations immediately. 30K SENPAI to the team vested for 3 months.", "choices": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "No Genesis Team Allocation"], "start": 1639525260, "end": 1639611660, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [407.589784153, 26588.458220284003, 0], "scores_total": 26996.048004437, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1639611689, "snapshot": "238928", "state": "closed", "author": "0xE3a948B9De9c3b9153124f0A526786814d8eC29e", "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth", "name": "SenpaiSwap"}, "votes": 14, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x0f56b41abedf2541d830b37e5bab5aee422501bd958523de4e1c0192cbd39617", "voter": "0x33b2b79C12Cae15582519CD992B5Dff9A0dC6d66", "created": 1639551397, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x7fd0a219025746eab86c835bd2b3811d3c9e5b764ad5fdd6da122fb0d323de33", "voter": "0xCd08F23C70702893bD190CC046d005eb95b3Cf40", "created": 1639530184, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x44b31c55d7c0939af855bbe3b0bc9996fee1f7e07b10dd72a8537687abc434b5", "voter": "0xFcb392c05e2e4843CA4FA3833A77c71e00275954", "created": 1639526937, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x58de94cc7b17b4e04ccbdc913a5836be3b4299e3de642737ef5fcbf2f64fd576", "voter": "0x369E7043369fb35eF02B40D477C5E97f76DC11f7", "created": 1639525992, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x32887a2fd4d2d88c529734cc4fdf3712604d55233a353ea651b0db6108f93c50", "voter": "0x18d6ad7BAb3e45126a6802e209038C329D89F480", "created": 1639525948, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x311861a14b562b3dd164fc8bc12960fb0b3874fd254be9185a5df3e7c8f4502b", "voter": "0x0E457324f0c6125b20392341Cdeb7bf9bCB02322", "created": 1639525864, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xd8b4ec692287bb8ea1593f8f6ee66a0f8339282f4c341b34735431156f082d21", "voter": "0xa23CB68780be74b254a5f7210Ec6cF1c76289953", "created": 1639525826, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x295f6a797bf8e52f825aabe010fc3253ff3d63a48984bdf246ea13e86e396f45", "voter": "0xd95E3a4589b56D2252fF238CC536bE1666bE8f25", "created": 1639525711, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x62fc2d3636095a9dae3bc92bcc25a5a18c1ed75898aa9bbb2cbfc49f34de1d77", "voter": "0x13360D1eC441AB0F140783c95296A8c8e460D9cD", "created": 1639525680, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x3fa83275e74e7845f233276a61360f0e8f0213543c90ca3fede3eeda28e82d3e", "voter": "0x8f2Dc6afb0771E9Eecc842d71f7599F8b2D33183", "created": 1639525624, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb53d56002ff052e907a2099f50b1b6affff3734dfa008a04491f3a7fba1b05a0", "voter": "0x642C7F7040C656d633A9267284B338FF41051541", "created": 1639525541, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x718849204f1c63eb577deef2dd4a82bff33e4bea14f8c03d86e964be72176d83", "voter": "0x9a640D5B56589a5C005eC58b08cf6a14e4120eeE", "created": 1639525512, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xcf4a6f689a497d86f8e863163390496b21528c3ebfebe084ecfe08066407d219", "voter": "0x282D99ed8BffF8ac4781916F8acA111dC1d328c2", "created": 1639525377, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x7813a6888d5e571d478bd9e4117e75a890f3fb8aded6e8b6155a0b8d8934fb15", "voter": "0x1552Fde02335E156468E5c6b6Ff20e123bcBDb85", "created": 1639525349, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "senpaidao.eth"}}]}
