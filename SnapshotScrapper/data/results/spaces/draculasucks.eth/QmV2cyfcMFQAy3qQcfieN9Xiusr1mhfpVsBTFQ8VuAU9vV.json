I think it should have its own in-house voting system and not be reliant on a third party solution. I have already made a NFT system that is self contained and for voting. I like the idea that one address is one vote. I have submitted it and am waiting for further response. I am able to work with the devs to fit it however they see. I however heard that NFT sharding was being considered. How much does the community want NFT sharding? \n\nI know that many people like vanity NFTs and NFTs that look cool, but I am coding my NFTs for utility. That being said, NFT sharding could help with pool ownership and many other such things. These are examples and I just hope to get community feedback on if that would be something people would want to see.\n\nI had already received a grant for .75 eth for my voting system, but I am looking to see what the community wants in terms of sharding.
