This is a good idea to drive hodlers & volume into MM but we should also have alternative concept for launchpad in the form of ICO/IDO/IEO/IGO. \n\nHow this works is that existing stakers under \u201cmillion pool\u201d will get to participate to raise funds for the new project/token and be early investor. The number for allocation of the new token would be based on the size of MM staked under \u201cmillion pool\u201d. Typically, the initial market cap for such projects would be capped to e.g. $50k/$100k but upon successful launch, the \u2018real\u2019 market cap would easily reach $10 mil if it\u2019s a sustainable project/have strong market demand\n\nA simple illustration of allocation to million pool stakers would be as follows:\nTier 1 (>50MM) \u2013 1 pool weight (lottery based)\nTier 2 (>150MM) \u2013 3 pool weight (guaranteed allocation)\nTier 3 (>500MM) \u2013 8 pool weight (guaranteed allocation)\nTier 4 (>1000MM) \u2013 20 pool weight (guaranteed allocation)\nTier 5 (>5000MM) \u2013 150 pool weight (guaranteed allocation)\nTier 6 (>10,000MM) \u2013 250 pool weight (guaranteed allocation)\n\nThe current examples of such launchpads would be the likes of Seedifyfund, Gamezone, Velaspad, Tronpad and etc. There are many successful projects incubated via this alternative launchpad, MM\u2019s price wouldn\u2019t be near where it is currently\n", "choices": ["Adopt this proposal", "Reject"], "start": 1637341200, "end": 1638284400, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [195.04243887721304, 508.071233294375], "scores_total": 703.1136721715881, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638284434, "snapshot": "13648824", "state": "closed", "author": "0xFfC02B1151237C76FD3799cba9Ba05a71Ed32004", "space": {"id": "millionpoll.eth", "name": "Million Poll"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmcvGJsE3hW7EMDyehfWFQYSBxddzdFXfB1Z1aM8CTineA", "voter": "0xfb0335cd099Ab511bf1Ddc650FE5e0669aEea910", "created": 1637370937, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "millionpoll.eth"}}, {"id": "0x50f9eae85544ccd1119229ed6996c16f65a826d7eef4b991ba16e1f42818e37f", "voter": "0xFfC02B1151237C76FD3799cba9Ba05a71Ed32004", "created": 1637369114, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "millionpoll.eth"}}]}
