Orange Party Dress by Di.Universe (USD500)\n2. Bachue Coat by Infinito (USD6000)\n3. Pause Physical T-Shirt by Temporary Malfunktion (USD500)\n\nIn response to this unfortunate happening, there is a direct opportunity to move more of a web3 native value model forward. Thus, with our unique vantage point at the forefront of web3 fashion, it only makes sense that we would be able to spot these historic moments in the making of the new fashion history. While it wouldn\u2019t be right for us to be the only bidders, the DIGITALAX Treasury is in the perfect position to participate in the biddings, and, if lucky enough, own these moments in web3 fashion history.\n\nEach of the designers 3 NFTs will go up for bid on the DIGITALAX Marketplace at the end of this week for a 5 day auction, where anyone can bid on the items, set with a reserve at the market price, as listed above. \n\nImagine if we were able to go back in time and own a piece of internet history. This is our historic of series of moments we have been living through over the past year as web3 fashion becomes more established, real, and transformative. It\u2019s always interesting, inspiring and invigorating and fascinating to remember how much of computing and technology comes from fabrics, textiles, thread, rope, nets and the methods developed to process them.\n\nSingle Choice Voting on whether or not the DIGITALAX Treasury should bid on the 3 items when they go live for Auction. If the items are won they will be held in the DIGITALAX Treasury Web3 Fashion Vault.", "choices": ["Treasury Should Bid ", "Treasury Should Not Bid "], "start": 1638810000, "end": 1639069200, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [28.393973134148368, 22.18009656486698], "scores_total": 50.574069699015354, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1639069223, "snapshot": "13750831", "state": "closed", "author": "0xAA3e5ee4fdC831e5274FE7836c95D670dC2502e6", "space": {"id": "digicore.eth", "name": "DIGITALAX"}, "votes": 15, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xd54b153d878a3df185fe3ac48d2fbf94f2b35239f91e467211de3b71aff05dd5", "voter": "0x1405926895600265260fe89fee8d1Cbd2c1a43f2", "created": 1639068442, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaA5XX2WNbAETk8QcCvUNvjpLFLwgCXTMDrUG4nsNQeCD", "voter": "0x7EA2BfbaDD5bC500166482F7949e4d7F44F9d4Ef", "created": 1639028959, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}, {"id": "0x5fc250dd299fedbdd828e8b0d39186189c8f7e698dd6d31d9ce7e205a1e5d972", "voter": "0x63435Ad7678eF11EB1C9F8D92aeEe96C2294817A", "created": 1638936462, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1d09d7ac5048c0661aa46cdeefe1c8cc810ea8cf8736948509885853ce239636", "voter": "0x2Bf034ecCEbc8CD60Dab9c249b6c2996Dcb7D8EC", "created": 1638928866, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}, {"id": "0xf5713b819213aa279e22a14c907140401bbf441468e712bb83d94b7db8ffd421", "voter": "0xE5581866864EE16567480868eba5077936D7334E", "created": 1638895758, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}, {"id": "0x67806cf31c37d961da8cbcd4ce2480d6595ec820d8e0eb7fcb16caa72585a3a1", "voter": "0x0e07e847d3f559556A8950DAB708db3EA8f2A710", "created": 1638880827, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1024900ae04a1ffea5aff7ff577d41e75ac4c11bc93ab61ca8c7c33b80910f76", "voter": "0x19A23d463b4BE0945C05Ba4e5Aa869adCAa55b08", "created": 1638871755, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}, {"id": "0x91b9387dd736d8a90479b3ac0c86fa93fb0a9e1d37139c483b3d541dc5c146a4", "voter": "0x31E985b4f7af6B479148d260309B7BcEcEF0fa7B", "created": 1638819718, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}, {"id": "0x8e148fec21d2dfa570cdbaf8b4739e2be755ee4881190441811d98a3967a9e1a", "voter": "0x89c96a9d9b43238db1f35D2297483d6964a56DFE", "created": 1638814593, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}, {"id": "0xde75d5e007b36cb8ba82fb4cb987a7f23f3db36069f1063f2eb8789acd091464", "voter": "0x9cf3fCd1cb9EddE720fDca9C68067201100D3d3a", "created": 1638814061, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe60dea6f27b7eea6630a5deed41699e8756e5467fa932e839ef6e22ccb5054b5", "voter": "0x25fFF4689be582515Ac968CC85E9B6d56076a297", "created": 1638813904, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}, {"id": "0xf13c48e81d36f93857ebf53cd405269c832ad5be0a189129f95097a95387f566", "voter": "0x07d13646BC89BfF92631A38B839F803b152f606d", "created": 1638813580, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}, {"id": "0x354f6df6ddc439e1a4d70e2bb79514f61512893dd5ca92ff2f51f5347d0b7d0f", "voter": "0x36a9F8491fFcE9BE17E0F132bdA64723901e65FB", "created": 1638812901, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}, {"id": "0xfea0200aca8bc7e55196cd899a054b7ec0ce4587ec8e4dbbd30e0b9f56ca2f42", "voter": "0x415FCE36e2Dc12421F20b93DbaD1dd68bd2F6db6", "created": 1638812554, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}, {"id": "0x29043ff200a6a99019d002532646441d45c4c109022d01091e2494ebecf5668e", "voter": "0x780909C4F1305E5953041E744B09E2F016180676", "created": 1638811884, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "digicore.eth"}}]}
