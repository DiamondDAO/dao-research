Myriel's budget.\rAs for the chance episcopal perquisites, the fees for marriage bans, dispensations, private baptisms, sermons, benedictions, of churches or chapels, marriages, etc., the Bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity, since he bestowed them on the needy.\rAfter a time, offerings of money flowed in.\rThose who had and those who lacked knocked at M. Myriel's door,--the latter in search of the alms which the former came to deposit.\rIn less than a year the Bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress.\rConsiderable sums of money passed through his hands, but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life, or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities.\rFar from it.\rAs there is always more wretchedness below than there is brotherhood above, all was given away, so to speak, before it was received.\rIt was like water on dry soil; no matter how much money he received, he never had any.\rThen he stripped himself.\rThe usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the head of their charges and their pastoral letters, the poor people of the country-side had selected, with a sort of affectionate instinct, among the names and prenomens of their bishop, that which had a meaning for them; and they never called him anything except Monseigneur Bienvenu [Welcome]. We will follow their example, and will also call him thus when we have occasion to name him.\rMoreover, this appellation pleased him.\r\"I like that name,\" said he.\r\"Bienvenu makes up for the Monseigneur.\"\rWe do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable; we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER III \rA HARD BISHOPRIC FOR A GOOD BISHOP\r The Bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms.\rThe diocese of D---- is a fatiguing one. There are very few plains and a great many mountains; hardly any roads, as we have just seen; thirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, and two hundred and eighty-five auxiliary chapels.\rTo visit all these is quite a task.\rThe Bishop managed to do it.\rHe went on foot when it was in the neighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, and on a donkey in the mountains.\rThe two old women accompanied him. When the trip was too hard for them, he went alone.\rOne day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal city. He was mounted on an ass.\rHis purse, which was very dry at that moment, did not permit him any other equipage.\rThe mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town, and watched him dismount from his ass, with scandalized eyes.\rSome of the citizens were laughing around him.\r\"Monsieur the Mayor,\" said the Bishop, \"and Messieurs Citizens, I perceive that I shock you.\rYou think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by Jesus Christ.\rI have done so from necessity, I assure you, and not from vanity.\"\rIn the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent, and talked rather than preached.\rHe never went far in search of his arguments and his examples.\rHe quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of a neighboring district.\rIn the cantons where they were harsh to the poor, he said:\r\"Look at the people of Briancon! They have conferred on the poor, on widows and orphans, the right to have their meadows mown three days in advance of every one else. They rebuild their houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined. Therefore it is a country which is blessed by God.\rFor a whole century, there has not been a single murderer among them.\"\rIn villages which were greedy for profit and harvest, he said: \"Look at the people of Embrun!\rIf, at the harvest season, the father of a family has his son away on service in the army, and his daughters at service in the town, and if he is ill and incapacitated, the cure recommends him to the prayers of the congregation; and on Sunday, after the mass, all the inhabitants of the village--men, women, and children--go to the poor man's field and do his harvesting for him, and carry his straw and his grain to his granary.\" To families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said: \"Look at the mountaineers of Devolny, a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years.\rWell, when the father of a family dies, the boys go off to seek their fortunes, leaving the property to the girls, so that they may find husbands.\" To the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits, and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper, he said:\r\"Look at those good peasants in the valley of Queyras!\rThere are three thousand souls of them. Mon Dieu! it is like a little republic.\rNeither judge nor bailiff is known there.\rThe mayor does everything.\rHe allots the imposts, taxes each person conscientiously, judges quarrels for nothing, divides inheritances without charge, pronounces sentences gratuitously; and he is obeyed, because he is a just man among simple men.\" To villages where he found no schoolmaster, he quoted once more the people of Queyras:\r\"Do you know how they manage?\" he said.\r\"Since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a teacher, they have school-masters who are paid by the whole valley, who make the round of the villages, spending a week in this one, ten days in that, and instruct them.\rThese teachers go to the fairs. I have seen them there.\rThey are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cord of their hat.\rThose who teach reading only have one pen; those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens; those who teach reading, reckoning, and Latin have three pens.\rBut what a disgrace to be ignorant!\rDo like the people of Queyras!\"\rThus he discoursed gravely and paternally; in default of examples, he invented parables, going directly to the point, with few phrases and many images, which characteristic formed the real eloquence of Jesus Christ.\rAnd being convinced himself, he was persuasive.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER IV \rWORKS CORRESPONDING TO WORDS \r His conversation was gay and affable.\rHe put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him. When he laughed, it was the laugh of a schoolboy.\rMadame Magloire liked to call him Your Grace [Votre Grandeur]. One day he rose from his arm-chair, and went to his library in search of a book. This book was on one of the upper shelves.\rAs the bishop was rather short of stature, he could not reach it.\r\"Madame Magloire,\" said he, \"fetch me a chair.\rMy greatness [grandeur] does not reach as far as that shelf.\"\rOne of his distant relatives, Madame la Comtesse de Lo, rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating, in his presence, what she designated as \"the expectations\" of her three sons. She had numerous relatives, who were very old and near to death, and of whom her sons were the natural heirs.\rThe youngest of the three was to receive from a grand-aunt a good hundred thousand livres of income; the second was the heir by entail to the title of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather.\rThe Bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts.\rOn one occasion, however, he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual, while Madame de Lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these \"expectations.\"\rShe interrupted herself impatiently: \"Mon Dieu, cousin!\rWhat are you thinking about?\"\r\"I am thinking,\" replied the Bishop, \"of a singular remark, which is to be found, I believe, in St. Augustine,--`Place your hopes in the man from whom you do not inherit.'\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639645646, "end": 1639904846, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639904871, "snapshot": "1639645646", "state": "closed", "author": "0x50847c52Cece53097456Af474CC96BF5F1403E37", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
