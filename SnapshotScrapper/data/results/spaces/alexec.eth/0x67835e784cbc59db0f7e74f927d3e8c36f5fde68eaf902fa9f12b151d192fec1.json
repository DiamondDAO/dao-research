Madame Magloire had once remarked, with a sort of gentle malice: \"Monseigneur, you who turn everything to account, have, nevertheless, one useless plot.\rIt would be better to grow salads there than bouquets.\" \"Madame Magloire,\" retorted the Bishop, \"you are mistaken. The beautiful is as useful as the useful.\"\rHe added after a pause, \"More so, perhaps.\"\rThis plot, consisting of three or four beds, occupied the Bishop almost as much as did his books.\rHe liked to pass an hour or two there, trimming, hoeing, and making holes here and there in the earth, into which he dropped seeds.\rHe was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him.\rMoreover, he made no pretensions to botany; he ignored groups and consistency; he made not the slightest effort to decide between Tournefort and the natural method; he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons, nor with Jussieu against Linnaeus.\rHe did not study plants; he loved flowers. He respected learned men greatly; he respected the ignorant still more; and, without ever failing in these two respects, he watered his flower-beds every summer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green.\rThe house had not a single door which could be locked.\rThe door of the dining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the cathedral square, had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison.\rThe Bishop had had all this ironwork removed, and this door was never fastened, either by night or by day, with anything except the latch.\rAll that the first passerby had to do at any hour, was to give it a push.\rAt first, the two women had been very much tried by this door, which was never fastened, but Monsieur de D---- had said to them, \"Have bolts put on your rooms, if that will please you.\"\rThey had ended by sharing his confidence, or by at least acting as though they shared it.\rMadame Magloire alone had frights from time to time.\rAs for the Bishop, his thought can be found explained, or at least indicated, in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a Bible, \"This is the shade of difference:\rthe door of the physician should never be shut, the door of the priest should always be open.\"\rOn another book, entitled Philosophy of the Medical Science, he had written this other note:\r\"Am not I a physician like them? I also have my patients, and then, too, I have some whom I call my unfortunates.\"\rAgain he wrote:\r\"Do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you.\rThe very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter.\"\rIt chanced that a worthy cure, I know not whether it was the cure of Couloubroux or the cure of Pompierry, took it into his head to ask him one day, probably at the instigation of Madame Magloire, whether Monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion, to a certain extent, in leaving his door unfastened day and night, at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter, and whether, in short, he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded.\rThe Bishop touched his shoulder, with gentle gravity, and said to him, \"Nisi Dominus custodierit domum, in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam,\" Unless the Lord guard the house, in vain do they watch who guard it.\rThen he spoke of something else.\rHe was fond of saying, \"There is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of dragoons,--only,\" he added, \"ours must be tranquil.\"\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER VII \rCRAVATTE \r It is here that a fact falls naturally into place, which we must not omit, because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a man the Bishop of D---- was.\rAfter the destruction of the band of Gaspard Bes, who had infested the gorges of Ollioules, one of his lieutenants, Cravatte, took refuge in the mountains.\rHe concealed himself for some time with his bandits, the remnant of Gaspard Bes's troop, in the county of Nice; then he made his way to Piedmont, and suddenly reappeared in France, in the vicinity of Barcelonette.\rHe was first seen at Jauziers, then at Tuiles.\rThen he added, with a smile, \"To him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop.\"\r\"Monseigneur,\" murmured the cure, throwing back his head with a smile. \"God--or the Devil.\"\rThe Bishop looked steadily at the cure, and repeated with authority, \"God!\"\rWhen he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity, all along the road.\rAt the priest's house in Chastelar he rejoined Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire, who were waiting for him, and he said to his sister:\r\"Well! was I in the right?\rThe poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands, and he returns from them with his hands full. I set out bearing only my faith in God; I have brought back the treasure of a cathedral.\"\rThat evening, before he went to bed, he said again:\r\"Let us never fear robbers nor murderers.\rThose are dangers from without, petty dangers.\rLet us fear ourselves.\rPrejudices are the real robbers; vices are the real murderers.\rThe great dangers lie within ourselves. What matters it what threatens our head or our purse!\rLet us think only of that which threatens our soul.\"\rThen, turning to his sister:\r\"Sister, never a precaution on the part of the priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, God permits.\rLet us confine ourselves to prayer, when we think that a danger is approaching us.\rLet us pray, not for ourselves, but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account.\"\rHowever, such incidents were rare in his life.\rWe relate those of which we know; but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at the same moment.\rOne month of his year resembled one hour of his day.\rAs to what became of \"the treasure\" of the cathedral of Embrun, we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction. It consisted of very handsome things, very tempting things, and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate.\rStolen they had already been elsewhere. Half of the adventure was completed; it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor.\rHowever, we make no assertions on this point.\rOnly, a rather obscure note was found among the Bishop's papers, which may bear some relation to this matter, and which is couched in these terms, \"The question is, to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital.\"\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER VIII \rPHILOSOPHY AFTER DRINKING \r The senator above mentioned was a clever man, who had made his own way, heedless of those things which present obstacles, and which are called conscience, sworn faith, justice, duty:\rhe had marched straight to his goal, without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest.\rHe was an old attorney, softened by success; not a bad man by any means, who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons, his sons-in-law, his relations, and even to his friends, having wisely seized upon, in life, good sides, good opportunities, good windfalls. Everything else seemed to him very stupid.\rHe was intelligent, and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of Epicurus; while he was, in reality, only a product of Pigault-Lebrun. He laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things, and at the \"Crotchets of that good old fellow the Bishop.\" He even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel himself, who listened to him.\rOn some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect what, Count*** [this senator] and M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect. At dessert, the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, though still perfectly dignified, exclaimed:--\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639645708, "end": 1639904908, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639904931, "snapshot": "1639645708", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7751a4b030dFd0622C0499959c97c03709Cd2ad6", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
