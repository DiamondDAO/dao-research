The mill is there no longer; the wind is still there.\"\r\"Louis XVII.! let us see.\rFor whom do you mourn? is it for the innocent child? very good; in that case I mourn with you. Is it for the royal child?\rI demand time for reflection. To me, the brother of Cartouche, an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the Place de Greve, until death ensued, for the sole crime of having been the brother of Cartouche, is no less painful than the grandson of Louis XV., an innocent child, martyred in the tower of the Temple, for the sole crime of having been grandson of Louis XV.\"\r\"Monsieur,\" said the Bishop, \"I like not this conjunction of names.\"\r\"Cartouche?\rLouis XV.? To which of the two do you object?\"\rA momentary silence ensued.\rThe Bishop almost regretted having come, and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken.\rThe conventionary resumed:--\r\"Ah, Monsieur Priest, you love not the crudities of the true. Christ loved them.\rHe seized a rod and cleared out the Temple. His scourge, full of lightnings, was a harsh speaker of truths. When he cried, `Sinite parvulos,' he made no distinction between the little children.\rIt would not have embarrassed him to bring together the Dauphin of Barabbas and the Dauphin of Herod.\rInnocence, Monsieur, is its own crown.\rInnocence has no need to be a highness. It is as august in rags as in fleurs de lys.\"\r\"That is true,\" said the Bishop in a low voice.\r\"I persist,\" continued the conventionary G---- \"You have mentioned Louis XVII.\rto me.\rLet us come to an understanding.\rShall we weep for all the innocent, all martyrs, all children, the lowly as well as the exalted?\rI agree to that.\rBut in that case, as I have told you, we must go back further than '93, and our tears must begin before Louis XVII.\rI will weep with you over the children of kings, provided that you will weep with me over the children of the people.\"\rThe former representative of the people made no reply.\rHe was seized with a fit of trembling.\rHe looked towards heaven, and in his glance a tear gathered slowly.\rWhen the eyelid was full, the tear trickled down his livid cheek, and he said, almost in a stammer, quite low, and to himself, while his eyes were plunged in the depths:--\r\"O thou!\rO ideal!\rThou alone existest!\"\rThe Bishop experienced an indescribable shock.\rAfter a pause, the old man raised a finger heavenward and said:--\r\"The infinite is.\rHe is there.\rIf the infinite had no person, person would be without limit; it would not be infinite; in other words, it would not exist.\rThere is, then, an _I_. That _I_ of the infinite is God.\"\rI have always upheld the march forward of the human race, forward towards the light, and I have sometimes resisted progress without pity.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639645852, "end": 1639905052, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905081, "snapshot": "1639645852", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1A8687E178653eBa5148ebdB7d2331eFCE2fE234", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
