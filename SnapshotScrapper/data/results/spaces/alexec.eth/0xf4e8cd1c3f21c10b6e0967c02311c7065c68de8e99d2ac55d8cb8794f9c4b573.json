A table was spread in the centre of the room.\rA copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the pewter jug shining like silver, and filled with wine, and the brown, smoking soup-tureen. At this table sat a man of about forty, with a merry and open countenance, who was dandling a little child on his knees.\rClose by a very young woman was nursing another child. The father was laughing, the child was laughing, the mother was smiling.\rThe stranger paused a moment in revery before this tender and calming spectacle.\rWhat was taking place within him? He alone could have told.\rIt is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospitable, and that, in a place where he beheld so much happiness, he would find perhaps a little pity.\rHe tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock.\rThey did not hear him.\rHe tapped again.\rHe heard the woman say, \"It seems to me, husband, that some one is knocking.\"\r\"No,\" replied the husband.\rHe tapped a third time.\rThe husband rose, took the lamp, and went to the door, which he opened.\rHe was a man of lofty stature, half peasant, half artisan. He wore a huge leather apron, which reached to his left shoulder, and which a hammer, a red handkerchief, a powder-horn, and all sorts of objects which were upheld by the girdle, as in a pocket, caused to bulge out.\r\"Knock there.\"\r\r\rBOOK SECOND--THE FALL\rCHAPTER II \rPRUDENCE COUNSELLED TO WISDOM.\r That evening, the Bishop of D----, after his promenade through the town, remained shut up rather late in his room.\rHe was busy over a great work on Duties, which was never completed, unfortunately.\rHe was carefully compiling everything that the Fathers and the doctors have said on this important subject.\rHis book was divided into two parts:\rfirstly, the duties of all; secondly, the duties of each individual, according to the class to which he belongs. The duties of all are the great duties.\rThere are four of these. Saint Matthew points them out:\r\"See here.\rMy name is Jean Valjean.\rI am a convict from the galleys. I have passed nineteen years in the galleys.\rI was liberated four days ago, and am on my way to Pontarlier, which is my destination. I have been walking for four days since I left Toulon.\rI have travelled a dozen leagues to-day on foot.\rThis evening, when I arrived in these parts, I went to an inn, and they turned me out, because of my yellow passport, which I had shown at the town-hall. I had to do it.\rI went to an inn.\rThey said to me, `Be off,' at both places.\rNo one would take me.\rI went to the prison; the jailer would not admit me.\rI went into a dog's kennel; the dog bit me and chased me off, as though he had been a man. One would have said that he knew who I was.\rI went into the fields, intending to sleep in the open air, beneath the stars.\rThere were no stars.\rI thought it was going to rain, and I re-entered the town, to seek the recess of a doorway.\rYonder, in the square, I meant to sleep on a stone bench.\rA good woman pointed out your house to me, and said to me, `Knock there!'\rI have knocked. What is this place?\rDo you keep an inn?\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639645984, "end": 1639905184, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905201, "snapshot": "1639645984", "state": "closed", "author": "0x8B8545C41635c22634b6E4fC5622c13a66FE73cE", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
