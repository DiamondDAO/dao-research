The Bishop of D----, in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him, sometimes did things that were grand, bold, and magnificent, without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact. They trembled, but they let him alone.\rSometimes Madame Magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance, but never at the time, nor afterwards. They never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign, in any action once entered upon.\rAt certain moments, without his having occasion to mention it, when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability, so perfect was his simplicity, they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop; then they were nothing more than two shadows in the house.\rThey served him passively; and if obedience consisted in disappearing, they disappeared. They understood, with an admirable delicacy of instinct, that certain cares may be put under constraint.\rThus, even when believing him to be in peril, they understood, I will not say his thought, but his nature, to such a degree that they no longer watched over him. They confided him to God.\rMoreover, Baptistine said, as we have just read, that her brother's end would prove her own.\rMadame Magloire did not say this, but she knew it.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER X \rTHE BISHOP IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNKNOWN LIGHT\r At an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the preceding pages, he did a thing which, if the whole town was to be believed, was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains infested with bandits.\rIn the country near D---- a man lived quite alone.\rThis man, we will state at once, was a former member of the Convention. His name was G----\rMember of the Convention, G---- was mentioned with a sort of horror in the little world of D---- A member of the Convention--can you imagine such a thing?\rThat existed from the time when people called each other thou, and when they said \"citizen.\"\rThis man was almost a monster.\rHe had not voted for the death of the king, but almost.\rHe was a quasi-regicide. He had been a terrible man. How did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a provost's court, on the return of the legitimate princes? They need not have cut off his head, if you please; clemency must be exercised, agreed; but a good banishment for life.\rAn example, in short, etc.\rBesides, he was an atheist, like all the rest of those people.\rGossip of the geese about the vulture.\rWas G---- a vulture after all?\rYes; if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his.\rAs he had not voted for the death of the king, he had not been included in the decrees of exile, and had been able to remain in France.\rHe dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city, far from any hamlet, far from any road, in some hidden turn of a very wild valley, no one knew exactly where.\rHe had there, it was said, a sort of field, a hole, a lair.\rThere were no neighbors, not even passers-by. Since he had dwelt in that valley, the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass. The locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of a hangman.\rNevertheless, the Bishop meditated on the subject, and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the Convention, and he said, \"There is a soul yonder which is lonely.\"\rAnd he added, deep in his own mind, \"I owe him a visit.\"\rBut, let us avow it, this idea, which seemed natural at the first blush, appeared to him after a moment's reflection, as strange, impossible, and almost repulsive.\rFor, at bottom, he shared the general impression, and the old member of the Convention inspired him, without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself, with that sentiment which borders on hate, and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement.\rStill, should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil? No. But what a sheep!\rThe good Bishop was perplexed.\rSometimes he set out in that direction; then he returned.\rFinally, the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd, who served the member of the Convention in his hovel, had come in quest of a doctor; that the old wretch was dying, that paralysis was gaining on him, and that he would not live over night.--\"Thank God!\" some added.\rThe Bishop took his staff, put on his cloak, on account of his too threadbare cassock, as we have mentioned, and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon, and set out.\rYou can talk to me; it does not fatigue me.\rYou have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death. It is well that there should be witnesses at that moment.\rOne has one's caprices; I should have liked to last until the dawn, but I know that I shall hardly live three hours.\rIt will be night then. What does it matter, after all?\rDying is a simple affair. One has no need of the light for that.\rSo be it.\rI shall die by starlight.\"\rThe old man turned to the shepherd lad:--\r\"Go to thy bed; thou wert awake all last night; thou art tired.\"\rThe child entered the hut.\rThe old man followed him with his eyes, and added, as though speaking to himself:--\r\"I shall die while he sleeps.\rThe two slumbers may be good neighbors.\"\rThe Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He did not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the whole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest:\rhe, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at \"His Grace,\" was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and he was almost tempted to retort \"citizen.\" He was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but which was not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of the Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the powerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably, the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.\rMeanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality, in which one could have distinguished, possibly, that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust.\rThe Bishop, on his side, although he generally restrained his curiosity, which, in his opinion, bordered on a fault, could not refrain from examining the member of the Convention with an attention which, as it did not have its course in sympathy, would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A member of the Convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law, even of the law of charity.\rG----, calm, his body almost upright, his voice vibrating, was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist. The Revolution had many of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof. Though so near to his end, he preserved all the gestures of health. In his clear glance, in his firm tone, in the robust movement of his shoulders, there was something calculated to disconcert death. Azrael, the Mohammedan angel of the sepulchre, would have turned back, and thought that he had mistaken the door.\rG---- seemed to be dying because he willed it so.\rThere was freedom in his agony.\rHis legs alone were motionless.\rIt was there that the shadows held him fast. His feet were cold and dead, but his head survived with all the power of life, and seemed full of light.\rG----, at this solemn moment, resembled the king in that tale of the Orient who was flesh above and marble below.\rThere was a stone there.\rThe Bishop sat down.\rThe exordium was abrupt.\r\"I congratulate you,\" said he, in the tone which one uses for a reprimand.\r\"You did not vote for the death of the king, after all.\"\rThe old member of the Convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words \"after all.\"\rHe replied. The smile had quite disappeared from his face.\r\"Do not congratulate me too much, sir.\rI did vote for the death of the tyrant.\"\rIt was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity.\r\"What do you mean to say?\" resumed the Bishop.\r\"I mean to say that man has a tyrant,--ignorance.\rI voted for the death of that tyrant.\rThat tyrant engendered royalty, which is authority falsely understood, while science is authority rightly understood. Man should be governed only by science.\"\r\"And conscience,\" added the Bishop.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469493, "end": 1639728693, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728702, "snapshot": "1639469493", "state": "closed", "author": "0x27FCEa585077D951794CbD4C929F9b4F0E2bf314", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
