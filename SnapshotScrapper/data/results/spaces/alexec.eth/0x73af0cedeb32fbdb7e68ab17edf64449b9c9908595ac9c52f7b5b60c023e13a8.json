He was tolerably eloquent.\rThe subject of his sermon was charity. He urged the rich to give to the poor, in order to avoid hell, which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable, and to win paradise, which he represented as charming and desirable. Among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant, who was somewhat of a usurer, named M. Geborand, who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth, serges, and woollen galloons. Never in his whole life had M. Geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of that sermon, it was observed that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old beggar-women at the door of the cathedral. There were six of them to share it.\rOne day the Bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity, and said to his sister, with a smile, \"There is M. Geborand purchasing paradise for a sou.\"\rWhen it was a question of charity, he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal, and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection.\rOnce he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room of the town; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier, a wealthy and avaricious old man, who contrived to be, at one and the same time, an ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairian. This variety of man has actually existed.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469340, "end": 1639728540, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [1, 0], "scores_total": 1, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728552, "snapshot": "1639469340", "state": "closed", "author": "0x87dd51eCC017187e922A1F082B08d866c644947e", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xc1e13a073dd4782531a39f7f31785b94de2180b11e159eab7523df07204b3802", "voter": "0x97432c12ea8C957C3aE2d59c9953CF8dF9CBc5b0", "created": 1639489916, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alexec.eth"}}]}
