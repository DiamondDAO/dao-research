Hurrah for Zero which leaves me in peace!\rBetween you and me, and in order to empty my sack, and make confession to my pastor, as it behooves me to do, I will admit to you that I have good sense. I am not enthusiastic over your Jesus, who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity.\r'Tis the counsel of an avaricious man to beggars.\rRenunciation; why?\rSacrifice; to what end? I do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of another wolf.\rLet us stick to nature, then.\rWe are at the top; let us have a superior philosophy.\rWhat is the advantage of being at the top, if one sees no further than the end of other people's noses?\rLet us live merrily.\rLife is all.\rThat man has another future elsewhere, on high, below, anywhere, I don't believe; not one single word of it.\rAh! sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me; I must take heed to everything I do; I must cudgel my brains over good and evil, over the just and the unjust, over the fas and the nefas.\rWhy?\rBecause I shall have to render an account of my actions.\rWhen?\rAfter death.\rWhat a fine dream! After my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me. Have a handful of dust seized by a shadow-hand, if you can. Let us tell the truth, we who are initiated, and who have raised the veil of Isis:\rthere is no such thing as either good or evil; there is vegetation.\rLet us seek the real.\rLet us get to the bottom of it.\rLet us go into it thoroughly.\rWhat the deuce! let us go to the bottom of it!\rWe must scent out the truth; dig in the earth for it, and seize it.\rThen it gives you exquisite joys. Then you grow strong, and you laugh.\rI am square on the bottom, I am.\rImmortality, Bishop, is a chance, a waiting for dead men's shoes.\rAh! what a charming promise! trust to it, if you like! What a fine lot Adam has!\rWe are souls, and we shall be angels, with blue wings on our shoulder-blades. Do come to my assistance: is it not Tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star?\rVery well.\rWe shall be the grasshoppers of the stars. And then, besides, we shall see God.\rTa, ta, ta!\rWhat twaddle all these paradises are!\rGod is a nonsensical monster.\rI would not say that in the Moniteur, egad! but I may whisper it among friends. Inter pocula.\rTo sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow.\rBe the dupe of the infinite! I'm not such a fool.\rI am a nought.\rI call myself Monsieur le Comte Nought, senator.\rDid I exist before my birth?\rNo. Shall I exist after death?\rNo. What am I?\rA little dust collected in an organism. What am I to do on this earth?\rThe choice rests with me: suffer or enjoy.\rWhither will suffering lead me?\rTo nothingness; but I shall have suffered.\rWhither will enjoyment lead me? To nothingness; but I shall have enjoyed myself.\rMy choice is made. One must eat or be eaten.\rI shall eat.\rIt is better to be the tooth than the grass.\rSuch is my wisdom.\rAfter which, go whither I push thee, the grave-digger is there; the Pantheon for some of us: all falls into the great hole.\rEnd.\rFinis.\rTotal liquidation. This is the vanishing-point. Death is death, believe me. I laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell me on that subject.\rFables of nurses; bugaboo for children; Jehovah for men.\rNo; our to-morrow is the night.\rBeyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness.\rYou have been Sardanapalus, you have been Vincent de Paul--it makes no difference.\rThat is the truth.\rThen live your life, above all things.\rMake use of your _I_ while you have it.\rIn truth, Bishop, I tell you that I have a philosophy of my own, and I have my philosophers.\rI don't let myself be taken in with that nonsense.\rOf course, there must be something for those who are down,--for the barefooted beggars, knife-grinders, and miserable wretches.\rLegends, chimeras, the soul, immortality, paradise, the stars, are provided for them to swallow. They gobble it down.\rThey spread it on their dry bread. He who has nothing else has the good.\rGod.\rThat is the least he can have.\rI oppose no objection to that; but I reserve Monsieur Naigeon for myself.\rThe good God is good for the populace.\"\rThe Bishop clapped his hands.\r\"That's talking!\" he exclaimed.\r\"What an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism!\rNot every one who wants it can have it.\rAh! when one does have it, one is no longer a dupe, one does not stupidly allow one's self to be exiled like Cato, nor stoned like Stephen, nor burned alive like Jeanne d'Arc. Those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible, and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness,--places, sinecures, dignities, power, whether well or ill acquired, lucrative recantations, useful treacheries, savory capitulations of conscience,--and that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished.\rHow agreeable that is! I do not say that with reference to you, senator.\rNevertheless, it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you.\rYou great lords have, so you say, a philosophy of your own, and for yourselves, which is exquisite, refined, accessible to the rich alone, good for all sauces, and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469447, "end": 1639728647, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728671, "snapshot": "1639469447", "state": "closed", "author": "0x02A9D1234C31b64D00aE6ACDF0A1fB3A6AE7ECbE", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
