She simply loved and venerated him.\rWhen he spoke, she bowed; when he acted, she yielded her adherence.\rTheir only servant, Madame Magloire, grumbled a little.\rIt will be observed that Monsieur the Bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres, which, added to the pension of Mademoiselle Baptistine, made fifteen hundred francs a year.\rOn these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted.\rAnd when a village curate came to D----, the Bishop still found means to entertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, and to the intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine.\rOne day, after he had been in D---- about three months, the Bishop said:--\r\"And still I am quite cramped with it all!\"\r\"I should think so!\" exclaimed Madame Magloire.\r\"Monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town, and for his journeys about the diocese.\rIt was customary for bishops in former days.\"\r\"Hold!\" cried the Bishop, \"you are quite right, Madame Magloire.\"\rAnd he made his demand.\rSome time afterwards the General Council took this demand under consideration, and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs, under this heading:\rAllowance to M. the Bishop for expenses of carriage, expenses of posting, and expenses of pastoral visits.\rThis provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senator of the Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundred which favored the 18 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of D----, wrote to M. Bigot de Preameneu, the minister of public worship, a very angry and confidential note on the subject, from which we extract these authentic lines:--\r \"Expenses of carriage?\rWhat can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants?\rExpenses of journeys?\rWhat is the use of these trips, in the first place?\rNext, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts?\rThere are no roads. No one travels otherwise than on horseback.\rEven the bridge between Durance and Chateau-Arnoux can barely support ox-teams. These priests are all thus, greedy and avaricious.\rThis man played the good priest when he first came.\rNow he does like the rest; he must have a carriage and a posting-chaise, he must have luxuries, like the bishops of the olden days.\rOh, all this priesthood! Things will not go well, M. le Comte, until the Emperor has freed us from these black-capped rascals.\rDown with the Pope!\r[Matters were getting embroiled with Rome.] For my part, I am for Caesar alone.\" Etc., etc.\r On the other hand, this affair afforded great delight to Madame Magloire. \"Good,\" said she to Mademoiselle Baptistine; \"Monseigneur began with other people, but he has had to wind up with himself, after all. He has regulated all his charities.\rNow here are three thousand francs for us!\rAt last!\"\rThat same evening the Bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a memorandum conceived in the following terms:--\rEXPENSES OF CARRIAGE AND CIRCUIT.\rFor furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital. 1,500 livres \rFor the maternity charitable society of Aix . . . . . . . 250 \" \rFor the maternity charitable society of Draguignan . . . 250 \" \rFor foundlings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500 \" \rAt another time, on receiving a notification of the decease of a gentleman of the country-side, wherein not only the dignities of the dead man, but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives, spread over an entire page:\r\"What a stout back Death has!\" he exclaimed.\r\"What a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him, and how much wit must men have, in order thus to press the tomb into the service of vanity!\"\rHe was gifted, on occasion, with a gentle raillery, which almost always concealed a serious meaning.\rIn the course of one Lent, a youthful vicar came to D----, and preached in the cathedral. He was tolerably eloquent.\rThe subject of his sermon was charity. He urged the rich to give to the poor, in order to avoid hell, which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable, and to win paradise, which he represented as charming and desirable. Among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant, who was somewhat of a usurer, named M. Geborand, who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth, serges, and woollen galloons. Never in his whole life had M. Geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of that sermon, it was observed that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old beggar-women at the door of the cathedral. There were six of them to share it.\rOne day the Bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity, and said to his sister, with a smile, \"There is M. Geborand purchasing paradise for a sou.\"\rWhen it was a question of charity, he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal, and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection.\rOnce he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room of the town; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier, a wealthy and avaricious old man, who contrived to be, at one and the same time, an ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairian. This variety of man has actually existed.\rHe understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love, of the mother who had lost her child.\rAs he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech.\rOh, admirable consoler!\rHe sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness, but to magnify and dignify it by hope.\rHe said:--\r\"Have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead. Think not of that which perishes.\rGaze steadily.\rYou will perceive the living light of your well-beloved dead in the depths of heaven.\" He knew that faith is wholesome.\rHe sought to counsel and calm the despairing man, by pointing out to him the resigned man, and to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER V \r MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU MADE HIS CASSOCKS LAST TOO LONG \r The private life of M. Myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his public life.\rThe voluntary poverty in which the Bishop of D---- lived, would have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have viewed it close at hand.\rHere is the note:--\r\"Oh, you who are!\r\"Ecclesiastes calls you the All-powerful; the Maccabees call you the Creator; the Epistle to the Ephesians calls you liberty; Baruch calls you Immensity; the Psalms call you Wisdom and Truth; John calls you Light; the Books of Kings call you Lord; Exodus calls you Providence; Leviticus, Sanctity; Esdras, Justice; the creation calls you God; man calls you Father; but Solomon calls you Compassion, and that is the most beautiful of all your names.\"\rToward nine o'clock in the evening the two women retired and betook themselves to their chambers on the first floor, leaving him alone until morning on the ground floor.\rIt is necessary that we should, in this place, give an exact idea of the dwelling of the Bishop of D----\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER VI \rWHO GUARDED HIS HOUSE FOR HIM \r The house in which he lived consisted, as we have said, of a ground floor, and one story above; three rooms on the ground floor, three chambers on the first, and an attic above.\rBehind the house was a garden, a quarter of an acre in extent.\rThe two women occupied the first floor; the Bishop was lodged below.\rThe first room, opening on the street, served him as dining-room, the second was his bedroom, and the third his oratory.\rThere was no exit possible from this oratory, except by passing through the bedroom, nor from the bedroom, without passing through the dining-room. At the end of the suite, in the oratory, there was a detached alcove with a bed, for use in cases of hospitality.\rThe Bishop offered this bed to country curates whom business or the requirements of their parishes brought to D----\rThe pharmacy of the hospital, a small building which had been added to the house, and abutted on the garden, had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar.\rIn addition to this, there was in the garden a stable, which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital, and in which the Bishop kept two cows.\rNo matter what the quantity of milk they gave, he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital.\r\"I am paying my tithes,\" he said.\rHis bedroom was tolerably large, and rather difficult to warm in bad weather.\rAs wood is extremely dear at D----, he hit upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed. Here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold: he called it his winter salon.\rIn this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood, and four straw-seated chairs. In addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an antique sideboard, painted pink, in water colors.\rOut of a similar sideboard, properly draped with white napery and imitation lace, the Bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory.\rHis wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D---- had more than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for Monseigneur's oratory; on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor.\r\"The most beautiful of altars,\" he said, \"is the soul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking God.\"\rIn his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an arm-chair, also in straw, in his bedroom.\rWhen, by chance, he received seven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, \ror the general, or the staff of the regiment in garrison, or several pupils from the little seminary, the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and the arm-chair from the bedroom:\rin this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639645682, "end": 1639904882, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639904901, "snapshot": "1639645682", "state": "closed", "author": "0x730a43E45a5527aaC9d64CbEed97d9bCED0869C9", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
