The gendarmes were set on his track, but in vain. He always escaped; sometimes he resisted by main force.\rHe was a bold wretch.\rIn the midst of all this terror the Bishop arrived. He was making his circuit to Chastelar.\rThe mayor came to meet him, and urged him to retrace his steps.\rCravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as Arche, and beyond; there was danger even with an escort; it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose.\r\"Therefore,\" said the Bishop, \"I intend to go without escort.\"\r\"You do not really mean that, Monseigneur!\" exclaimed the mayor.\r\"I do mean it so thoroughly that I absolutely refuse any gendarmes, and shall set out in an hour.\"\r\"Set out?\"\r\"Set out.\"\r\"Alone?\"\r\"Alone.\"\r\"Monseigneur, you will not do that!\"\r\"There exists yonder in the mountains,\" said the Bishop, a tiny community no bigger than that, which I have not seen for three years. They are my good friends, those gentle and honest shepherds.\rThey own one goat out of every thirty that they tend.\rThey make very pretty woollen cords of various colors, and they play the mountain airs on little flutes with six holes.\rThey need to be told of the good God now and then.\rWhat would they say to a bishop who was afraid? What would they say if I did not go?\"\r\"But the brigands, Monseigneur?\"\r\"Hold,\" said the Bishop, \"I must think of that.\rYou are right. I may meet them.\rThey, too, need to be told of the good God.\"\r\"But, Monseigneur, there is a band of them!\rA flock of wolves!\"\r\"Monsieur le maire, it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that Jesus has constituted me the shepherd.\rWho knows the ways of Providence?\"\r\"They will rob you, Monseigneur.\"\r\"I have nothing.\"\r\"They will kill you.\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469424, "end": 1639728624, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728642, "snapshot": "1639469424", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4a05Fd9e283BcAF81fa09062b764238F5096c359", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
