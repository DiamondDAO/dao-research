He raised himself on one elbow, took a bit of his cheek between his thumb and his forefinger, as one does mechanically when one interrogates and judges, and appealed to the Bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of the death agony.\rIt was almost an explosion.\r\"Yes, sir, the people have been suffering a long while.\rAnd hold! that is not all, either; why have you just questioned me and talked to me about Louis XVII.? I know you not.\rEver since I have been in these parts I have dwelt in this enclosure alone, never setting foot outside, and seeing no one but that child who helps me. Your name has reached me in a confused manner, it is true, and very badly pronounced, I must admit; but that signifies nothing:\rclever men have so many ways of imposing on that honest goodman, the people. By the way, I did not hear the sound of your carriage; you have left it yonder, behind the coppice at the fork of the roads, no doubt. I do not know you, I tell you.\rYou have told me that you are the Bishop; but that affords me no information as to your moral personality. In short, I repeat my question.\rWho are you?\rYou are a bishop; that is to say, a prince of the church, one of those gilded men with heraldic bearings and revenues, who have vast prebends,-- the bishopric of D---- fifteen thousand francs settled income, ten thousand in perquisites; total, twenty-five thousand francs,-- who have kitchens, who have liveries, who make good cheer, who eat moor-hens on Friday, who strut about, a lackey before, a lackey behind, in a gala coach, and who have palaces, and who roll in their carriages in the name of Jesus Christ who went barefoot! You are a prelate,--revenues, palace, horses, servants, good table, all the sensualities of life; you have this like the rest, and like the rest, you enjoy it; it is well; but this says either too much or too little; this does not enlighten me upon the intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable intention of bringing wisdom to me.\rTo whom do I speak? Who are you?\"\rThe Bishop hung his head and replied, \"Vermis sum--I am a worm.\"\r\"A worm of the earth in a carriage?\" growled the conventionary.\rIt was the conventionary's turn to be arrogant, and the Bishop's to be humble.\rThe Bishop resumed mildly:--\r\"So be it, sir.\rBut explain to me how my carriage, which is a few paces off behind the trees yonder, how my good table and the moor-hens which I eat on Friday, how my twenty-five thousand francs income, how my palace and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty, and that '93 was not inexorable.\rThe conventionary passed his hand across his brow, as though to sweep away a cloud.\r\"Before replying to you,\" he said, \"I beseech you to pardon me. I have just committed a wrong, sir.\rYou are at my house, you are my guest, I owe you courtesy.\rYou discuss my ideas, and it becomes me to confine myself to combating your arguments.\rYour riches and your pleasures are advantages which I hold over you in the debate; but good taste dictates that I shall not make use of them.\rI promise you to make no use of them in the future.\"\r\"I thank you,\" said the Bishop.\rG---- resumed.\r\"Let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me. Where were we?\rWhat were you saying to me?\rThat '93 was inexorable?\"\r\"Inexorable; yes,\" said the Bishop.\r\"What think you of Marat clapping his hands at the guillotine?\"\r\"What think you of Bossuet chanting the Te Deum over the dragonnades?\"\rThe retort was a harsh one, but it attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel.\rThe Bishop quivered under it; no reply occurred to him; but he was offended by this mode of alluding to Bossuet.\rThe best of minds will have their fetiches, and they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic.\rThe conventionary began to pant; the asthma of the agony which is mingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice; still, there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes.\rHe went on:--\r\"Let me say a few words more in this and that direction; I am willing.\rApart from the Revolution, which, taken as a whole, is an immense human affirmation, '93 is, alas! a rejoinder. You think it inexorable, sir; but what of the whole monarchy, sir? Carrier is a bandit; but what name do you give to Montrevel? Fouquier-Tainville is a rascal; but what is your opinion as to Lamoignon-Baville? Maillard is terrible; but Saulx-Tavannes, if you please?\rDuchene senior is ferocious; but what epithet will you allow me for the elder Letellier?\rJourdan-Coupe-Tete is a monster; but not so great a one as M. the Marquis de Louvois. Sir, sir, I am sorry for Marie Antoinette, archduchess and queen; but I am also sorry for that poor Huguenot woman, who, in 1685, under Louis the Great, sir, while with a nursing infant, was bound, naked to the waist, to a stake, and the child kept at a distance; her breast swelled with milk and her heart with anguish; the little one, hungry and pale, beheld that breast and cried and agonized; the executioner said to the woman, a mother and a nurse, `Abjure!' giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the death of her conscience.\rWhat say you to that torture of Tantalus as applied to a mother?\rBear this well in mind sir: the French Revolution had its reasons for existence; its wrath will be absolved by the future; its result is the world made better. From its most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the human race.\rI abridge, I stop, I have too much the advantage; moreover, I am dying.\"\rAnd ceasing to gaze at the Bishop, the conventionary concluded his thoughts in these tranquil words:--\r\"Yes, the brutalities of progress are called revolutions. When they are over, this fact is recognized,--that the human race has been treated harshly, but that it has progressed.\"\rThe conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all the inmost intrenchments of the Bishop.\rOne remained, however, and from this intrenchment, the last resource of Monseigneur Bienvenu's resistance, came forth this reply, wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning:--\r\"Progress should believe in God.\rGood cannot have an impious servitor. He who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race.\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639645828, "end": 1639905028, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905052, "snapshot": "1639645828", "state": "closed", "author": "0xD2FC9453BB293418811185ac3e55812E6EEDCD3B", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
