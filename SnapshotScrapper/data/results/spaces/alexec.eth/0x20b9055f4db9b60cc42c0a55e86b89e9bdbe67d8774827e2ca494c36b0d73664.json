When he had spoken, his eyes closed.\rThe effort had exhausted him. It was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him.\rThat which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death.\rThe supreme moment was approaching.\rThe Bishop understood this; time pressed; it was as a priest that he had come:\rfrom extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion; he gazed at those closed eyes, he took that wrinkled, aged and ice-cold hand in his, and bent over the dying man.\r\"This hour is the hour of God.\rDo you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain?\"\rThe conventionary opened his eyes again.\rA gravity mingled with gloom was imprinted on his countenance.\r\"Bishop,\" said he, with a slowness which probably arose more from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength, \"I have passed my life in meditation, study, and contemplation. I was sixty years of age when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs.\rI obeyed.\rAbuses existed, I combated them; tyrannies existed, I destroyed them; rights and principles existed, I proclaimed and confessed them.\rOur territory was invaded, I defended it; France was menaced, I offered my breast. I was not rich; I am poor.\rI have been one of the masters of the state; the vaults of the treasury were encumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls, which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and silver; I dined in Dead Tree Street, at twenty-two sous. I have succored the oppressed, I have comforted the suffering. I tore the cloth from the altar, it is true; but it was to bind up the wounds of my country.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639645841, "end": 1639905041, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905052, "snapshot": "1639645841", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2F2262d48201036BE0Af080030028EDc27b357A1", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
