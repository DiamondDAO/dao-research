It is our established custom; but there is another reason besides. Just imagine, while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls, Madam Magloire has made some discoveries; now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over, would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours.\rMadam Magloire has pulled off all the paper. There were things beneath.\rMy drawing-room, which contains no furniture, and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing, is fifteen feet in height, eighteen square, with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded, and with beams, as in yours. This was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital. And the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers.\rBut my room is the one you ought to see.\rMadam Magloire has discovered, under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top, some paintings, which without being good are very tolerable.\rThe subject is Telemachus being knighted by Minerva in some gardens, the name of which escapes me.\rIn short, where the Roman ladies repaired on one single night.\rWhat shall I say to you?\rI have Romans, and Roman ladies [here occurs an illegible word], and the whole train. Madam Magloire has cleaned it all off; this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired, and the whole revarnished, and my chamber will be a regular museum.\rShe has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables of ancient fashion. They asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them, but it is much better to give the money to the poor; and they are very ugly besides, and I should much prefer a round table of mahogany.\rI am always very happy.\rMy brother is so good.\rHe gives all he has to the poor and sick.\rWe are very much cramped.\rThe country is trying in the winter, and we really must do something for those who are in need.\rWe are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that these are great treats.\rAnd his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child.\rThe Bishop stepped forward.\rAt the sound which he made in walking, the old man turned his head, and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life.\r\"This is the first time since I have been here,\" said he, \"that any one has entered here.\r\"Something of that sort.\"\r\"Enter, sir.\"\rThe member of the Convention extended his hand to the Bishop, but the Bishop did not take it.\rThe Bishop confined himself to the remark:--\r\"I am pleased to see that I have been misinformed.\rYou certainly do not seem to me to be ill.\"\r\"Monsieur,\" replied the old man, \"I am going to recover.\"\rHe paused, and then said:--\r\"I shall die three hours hence.\"\rThen he continued:--\r\"I am something of a doctor; I know in what fashion the last hour draws on.\rYesterday, only my feet were cold; to-day, the chill has ascended to my knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; when it reaches the heart, I shall stop.\rThe sun is beautiful, is it not?\rI had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things.\rYou can talk to me; it does not fatigue me.\rYou have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death. It is well that there should be witnesses at that moment.\rOne has one's caprices; I should have liked to last until the dawn, but I know that I shall hardly live three hours.\rIt will be night then. What does it matter, after all?\rDying is a simple affair. One has no need of the light for that.\rSo be it.\rI shall die by starlight.\"\rThe old man turned to the shepherd lad:--\r\"Go to thy bed; thou wert awake all last night; thou art tired.\"\rThe child entered the hut.\rThe old man followed him with his eyes, and added, as though speaking to himself:--\r\"I shall die while he sleeps.\rThe two slumbers may be good neighbors.\"\rThe Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He did not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the whole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest:\rhe, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at \"His Grace,\" was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and he was almost tempted to retort \"citizen.\" He was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but which was not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of the Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the powerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably, the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.\rMeanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality, in which one could have distinguished, possibly, that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust.\rThe Bishop, on his side, although he generally restrained his curiosity, which, in his opinion, bordered on a fault, could not refrain from examining the member of the Convention with an attention which, as it did not have its course in sympathy, would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A member of the Convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law, even of the law of charity.\rG----, calm, his body almost upright, his voice vibrating, was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist. The Revolution had many of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof. Though so near to his end, he preserved all the gestures of health. In his clear glance, in his firm tone, in the robust movement of his shoulders, there was something calculated to disconcert death. Azrael, the Mohammedan angel of the sepulchre, would have turned back, and thought that he had mistaken the door.\rG---- seemed to be dying because he willed it so.\rThere was freedom in his agony.\rHis legs alone were motionless.\rIt was there that the shadows held him fast. His feet were cold and dead, but his head survived with all the power of life, and seemed full of light.\rG----, at this solemn moment, resembled the king in that tale of the Orient who was flesh above and marble below.\rThere was a stone there.\rThe Bishop sat down.\rThe exordium was abrupt.\r\"I congratulate you,\" said he, in the tone which one uses for a reprimand.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639645781, "end": 1639904981, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639904992, "snapshot": "1639645781", "state": "closed", "author": "0xDe17749d3631CdDDd8fDaD3A8A118cF6E67B2369", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
