MY GOOD MADAM:\rNot a day passes without our speaking of you. It is our established custom; but there is another reason besides. Just imagine, while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls, Madam Magloire has made some discoveries; now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over, would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours.\rMadam Magloire has pulled off all the paper. There were things beneath.\rMy drawing-room, which contains no furniture, and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing, is fifteen feet in height, eighteen square, with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded, and with beams, as in yours. This was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital. And the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers.\rBut my room is the one you ought to see.\rMadam Magloire has discovered, under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top, some paintings, which without being good are very tolerable.\rThe subject is Telemachus being knighted by Minerva in some gardens, the name of which escapes me.\rIn short, where the Roman ladies repaired on one single night.\rWhat shall I say to you?\rI have Romans, and Roman ladies [here occurs an illegible word], and the whole train. Madam Magloire has cleaned it all off; this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired, and the whole revarnished, and my chamber will be a regular museum.\rShe has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables of ancient fashion. They asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them, but it is much better to give the money to the poor; and they are very ugly besides, and I should much prefer a round table of mahogany.\rI am always very happy.\rMy brother is so good.\rHe gives all he has to the poor and sick.\rWe are very much cramped.\rThe country is trying in the winter, and we really must do something for those who are in need.\rWe are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that these are great treats.\rMy brother has ways of his own.\rWhen he talks, he says that a bishop ought to be so.\rJust imagine! the door of our house is never fastened. Whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother's room. He fears nothing, even at night.\rThat is his sort of bravery, he says.\rHe does not wish me or Madame Magloire feel any fear for him. He exposes himself to all sorts of dangers, and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it.\rOne must know how to understand him.\rHe goes out in the rain, he walks in the water, he travels in winter. He fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters, nor night.\r year he went quite alone into a country of robbers.\rHe would not take us.\rHe was absent for a fortnight.\rOn his return nothing had happened to him; he was thought to be dead, but was perfectly well, and said, \"This is the way I have been robbed!\"\rAnd then he opened a trunk full of jewels, all the jewels of the cathedral of Embrun, which the thieves had given him.\rWhen he returned on that occasion, I could not refrain from scolding him a little, taking care, however, not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise, so that no one might hear me.\rAt first I used to say to myself, \"There are no dangers which will stop him; he is terrible.\"\rNow I have ended by getting used to it. I make a sign to Madam Magloire that she is not to oppose him. He risks himself as he sees fit.\rI carry off Madam Magloire, I enter my chamber, I pray for him and fall asleep.\rI am at ease, because I know that if anything were to happen to him, it would be the end of me.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469458, "end": 1639728658, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728672, "snapshot": "1639469458", "state": "closed", "author": "0x26Ce4276aF98017a299aF323b0575176A328Bde8", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
