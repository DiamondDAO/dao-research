Every bishop who possesses the least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary, which goes the round, and maintains good order in the episcopal palace, and mounts guard over monseigneur's smile.\rTo please a bishop is equivalent to getting one's foot in the stirrup for a sub-diaconate. It is necessary to walk one's path discreetly; the apostleship does not disdain the canonship.\rJust as there are bigwigs elsewhere, there are big mitres in the Church. These are the bishops who stand well at Court, who are rich, well endowed, skilful, accepted by the world, who know how to pray, no doubt, but who know also how to beg, who feel little scruple at making a whole diocese dance attendance in their person, who are connecting links between the sacristy and diplomacy, who are abbes rather than priests, prelates rather than bishops. Happy those who approach them!\rBeing persons of influence, they create a shower about them, upon the assiduous and the favored, and upon all the young men who understand the art of pleasing, of large parishes, prebends, archidiaconates, chaplaincies, and cathedral posts, while awaiting episcopal honors.\rAs they advance themselves, they cause their satellites to progress also; it is a whole solar system on the march.\rTheir radiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite.\rTheir prosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes, into nice little promotions.\rThe larger the diocese of the patron, the fatter the curacy for the favorite.\rAnd then, there is Rome.\rA bishop who understands how to become an archbishop, an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal, carries you with him as conclavist; you enter a court of papal jurisdiction, you receive the pallium, and behold! you are an auditor, then a papal chamberlain, then monsignor, and from a Grace to an Eminence is only a step, and between the Eminence and the Holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot.\rEvery skull-cap may dream of the tiara. The priest is nowadays the only man who can become a king in a regular manner; and what a king! the supreme king.\rThen what a nursery of aspirations is a seminary!\rHow many blushing choristers, how many youthful abbes bear on their heads Perrette's pot of milk! Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation? in good faith, perchance, and deceiving itself, devotee that it is.\rMonseigneur Bienvenu, poor, humble, retiring, was not accounted among the big mitres.\rThis was plain from the complete absence of young priests about him.\rWe have seen that he \"did not take\" in Paris.\rNot a single future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man.\rNot a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow.\rHis canons and grand-vicars were good old men, rather vulgar like himself, walled up like him in this diocese, without exit to a cardinalship, and who resembled their bishop, with this difference, that they were finished and he was completed.\rThe impossibility of growing great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so well understood, that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix or of Auch, and went off in a great hurry.\rFor, in short, we repeat it, men wish to be pushed.\rA saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor; he might communicate to you, by contagion, an incurable poverty, an anchylosis of the joints, which are useful in advancement, and in short, more renunciation than you desire; and this infectious virtue is avoided.\rHence the isolation of Monseigneur Bienvenu.\rWe live in the midst of a gloomy society. Success; that is the lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption.\rBe it said in passing, that success is a very hideous thing.\rIts false resemblance to merit deceives men.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639646019, "end": 1639905219, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905232, "snapshot": "1639646019", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4D3cc3fb4306765f72c7DB8CF9B88BB1706b31af", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
