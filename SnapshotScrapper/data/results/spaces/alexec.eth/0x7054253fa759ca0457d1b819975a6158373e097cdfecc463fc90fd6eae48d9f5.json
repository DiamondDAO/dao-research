When he laughed, it was the laugh of a schoolboy.\rMadame Magloire liked to call him Your Grace [Votre Grandeur]. One day he rose from his arm-chair, and went to his library in search of a book. This book was on one of the upper shelves.\rAs the bishop was rather short of stature, he could not reach it.\r\"Madame Magloire,\" said he, \"fetch me a chair.\rWhen he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly, and growing angry very quickly, \"Oh! oh!\" he said, with a smile; \"to all appearance, this is a great crime which all the world commits.\rThese are hypocrisies which have taken fright, and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter.\"\rHe was indulgent towards women and poor people, on whom the burden of human society rest.\rHe said, \"The faults of women, of children, of the feeble, the indigent, and the ignorant, are the fault of the husbands, the fathers, the masters, the strong, the rich, and the wise.\"\rHe said, moreover, \"Teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible; society is culpable, in that it does not afford instruction gratis; it is responsible for the night which it produces. This soul is full of shadow; sin is therein committed.\rThe guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin, but the person who has created the shadow.\"\rIt will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things:\rOne would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it. The children and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as for the sun.\rHe bestowed his blessing, and they blessed him. They pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything.\rHere and there he halted, accosted the little boys and girls, and smiled upon the mothers.\rHe visited the poor so long as he had any money; when he no longer had any, he visited the rich.\rAs he made his cassocks last a long while, and did not wish to have it noticed, he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak.\rThis inconvenienced him somewhat in summer.\rOn his return, he dined.\rThe dinner resembled his breakfast.\rAt half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister, Madame Magloire standing behind them and serving them at table. Nothing could be more frugal than this repast.\rIf, however, the Bishop had one of his cures to supper, Madame Magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve Monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake, or with some fine game from the mountains.\rEvery cure furnished the pretext for a good meal:\rthe Bishop did not interfere. With that exception, his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water, and oil soup.\rThus it was said in the town, when the Bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cure, he indulges in the cheer of a trappist.\rAfter supper he conversed for half an hour with Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire; then he retired to his own room and set to writing, sometimes on loose sheets, and again on the margin of some folio. He was a man of letters and rather learned.\rHe left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts; among others, a dissertation on this verse in Genesis, In the beginning, the spirit of God floated upon the waters.\rWith this verse he compares three texts: the Arabic verse which says, The winds of God blew; Flavius Josephus who says, A wind from above was precipitated upon the earth; and finally, the Chaldaic paraphrase of Onkelos, which renders it, A wind coming from God blew upon the face of the waters. In another dissertation, he examines the theological works of Hugo, Bishop of Ptolemais, great-grand-uncle to the writer of this book, and establishes the fact, that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works published during the last century, under the pseudonym of Barleycourt.\rSometimes, in the midst of his reading, no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand, he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation, whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself.\rThese lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them.\rWe now have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled Correspondence of Lord Germain with Generals Clinton, Cornwallis, and the Admirals on the American station.\rVersailles, Poincot, book-seller; and Paris, Pissot, bookseller, Quai des Augustins.\rHere is the note:--\r\"Oh, you who are!\r\"Ecclesiastes calls you the All-powerful; the Maccabees call you the Creator; the Epistle to the Ephesians calls you liberty; Baruch calls you Immensity; the Psalms call you Wisdom and Truth; John calls you Light; the Books of Kings call you Lord; Exodus calls you Providence; Leviticus, Sanctity; Esdras, Justice; the creation calls you God; man calls you Father; but Solomon calls you Compassion, and that is the most beautiful of all your names.\"\rToward nine o'clock in the evening the two women retired and betook themselves to their chambers on the first floor, leaving him alone until morning on the ground floor.\rIt is necessary that we should, in this place, give an exact idea of the dwelling of the Bishop of D----\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER VI \rWHO GUARDED HIS HOUSE FOR HIM \r The house in which he lived consisted, as we have said, of a ground floor, and one story above; three rooms on the ground floor, three chambers on the first, and an attic above.\rBehind the house was a garden, a quarter of an acre in extent.\rThe two women occupied the first floor; the Bishop was lodged below.\rThe first room, opening on the street, served him as dining-room, the second was his bedroom, and the third his oratory.\rThere was no exit possible from this oratory, except by passing through the bedroom, nor from the bedroom, without passing through the dining-room. At the end of the suite, in the oratory, there was a detached alcove with a bed, for use in cases of hospitality.\rThe Bishop offered this bed to country curates whom business or the requirements of their parishes brought to D----\rThe pharmacy of the hospital, a small building which had been added to the house, and abutted on the garden, had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar.\rIn addition to this, there was in the garden a stable, which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital, and in which the Bishop kept two cows.\rNo matter what the quantity of milk they gave, he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital.\r\"I am paying my tithes,\" he said.\rHis bedroom was tolerably large, and rather difficult to warm in bad weather.\rAs wood is extremely dear at D----, he hit upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed. Here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold: he called it his winter salon.\rIn this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood, and four straw-seated chairs. In addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an antique sideboard, painted pink, in water colors.\rOut of a similar sideboard, properly draped with white napery and imitation lace, the Bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory.\rHis wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D---- had more than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for Monseigneur's oratory; on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor.\r\"The most beautiful of altars,\" he said, \"is the soul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking God.\"\rIn his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an arm-chair, also in straw, in his bedroom.\rWhen, by chance, he received seven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, \ror the general, or the staff of the regiment in garrison, or several pupils from the little seminary, the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and the arm-chair from the bedroom:\rHence this decoration. The chambers were paved in red bricks, which were washed every week, with straw mats in front of all the beds.\rAltogether, this dwelling, which was attended to by the two women, was exquisitely clean from top to bottom.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469412, "end": 1639728612, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728641, "snapshot": "1639469412", "state": "closed", "author": "0xe0842e68Ae2508dcAae46ba3770807A10A29Ecfc", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
