That _I_ of the infinite is God.\"\rThe dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice, and with the shiver of ecstasy, as though he beheld some one. When he had spoken, his eyes closed.\rThe effort had exhausted him. It was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him.\rThat which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death.\rThe supreme moment was approaching.\rThe Bishop understood this; time pressed; it was as a priest that he had come:\rfrom extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion; he gazed at those closed eyes, he took that wrinkled, aged and ice-cold hand in his, and bent over the dying man.\r\"This hour is the hour of God.\rDo you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain?\"\rThe conventionary opened his eyes again.\rA gravity mingled with gloom was imprinted on his countenance.\r\"Bishop,\" said he, with a slowness which probably arose more from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength, \"I have passed my life in meditation, study, and contemplation. I was sixty years of age when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs.\rI obeyed.\rAbuses existed, I combated them; tyrannies existed, I destroyed them; rights and principles existed, I proclaimed and confessed them.\rOur territory was invaded, I defended it; France was menaced, I offered my breast. I was not rich; I am poor.\rI have been one of the masters of the state; the vaults of the treasury were encumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls, which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and silver; I dined in Dead Tree Street, at twenty-two sous. I have succored the oppressed, I have comforted the suffering. I tore the cloth from the altar, it is true; but it was to bind up the wounds of my country.\rI have always upheld the march forward of the human race, forward towards the light, and I have sometimes resisted progress without pity.\rI have, when the occasion offered, protected my own adversaries, men of your profession.\rAnd there is at Peteghem, in Flanders, at the very spot where the Merovingian kings had their summer palace, a convent of Urbanists, the Abbey of Sainte Claire en Beaulieu, which I saved in 1793.\rI have done my duty according to my powers, and all the good that I was able. After which, I was hunted down, pursued, persecuted, blackened, jeered at, scorned, cursed, proscribed.\rFor many years past, I with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they have the right to despise me; to the poor ignorant masses I present the visage of one damned.\rAnd I accept this isolation of hatred, without hating any one myself.\rNow I am eighty-six years old; I am on the point of death.\rWhat is it that you have come to ask of me?\"\r\"Your blessing,\" said the Bishop.\rAnd he knelt down.\rWhen the Bishop raised his head again, the face of the conventionary had become august.\rHe had just expired.\rThe Bishop returned home, deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannot be known to us.\rHe passed the whole night in prayer. On the following morning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about member of the Convention G----; he contented himself with pointing heavenward.\rFrom that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers.\rAny allusion to \"that old wretch of a G----\" caused him to fall into a singular preoccupation.\rNo one could say that the passage of that soul before his, and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his, did not count for something in his approach to perfection.\rThis \"pastoral visit\" naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coteries.\r\"Was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop?\rThere was evidently no conversion to be expected. All those revolutionists are backsliders.\rThen why go there? What was there to be seen there?\rHe must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried off by the devil.\"\rOne day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself spiritual, addressed this sally to him, \"Monseigneur, people are inquiring when Your Greatness will receive the red cap!\"--\"Oh! oh! that's a coarse color,\" replied the Bishop. \"It is lucky that those who despise it in a cap revere it in a hat.\"\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER XI \rA RESTRICTION\r We should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves, were we to conclude from this that Monseigneur Welcome was \"a philosophical bishop,\" or a \"patriotic cure.\"\rHis meeting, which may almost be designated as his union, with conventionary G----, left behind it in his mind a sort of astonishment, which rendered him still more gentle. That is all.\rAlthough Monseigneur Bienvenu was far from being a politician, this is, perhaps, the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the events of that epoch, supposing that Monseigneur Bienvenu ever dreamed of having an attitude.\rLet us, then, go back a few years.\rSome time after the elevation of M. Myriel to the episcopate, the Emperor had made him a baron of the Empire, in company with many other bishops.\rThe arrest of the Pope took place, as every one knows, on the night of the 5th to the 6th of July, 1809; on this occasion, M. Myriel was summoned by Napoleon to the synod of the bishops of France and Italy convened at Paris.\rThis synod was held at Notre-Dame, and assembled for the first time on the 15th of June, 1811, under the presidency of Cardinal Fesch.\rM. Myriel was one of the ninety-five bishops who attended it.\rBut he was present only at one sitting and at three or four private conferences. Bishop of a mountain diocese, living so very close to nature, in rusticity and deprivation, it appeared that he imported among these eminent personages, ideas which altered the temperature of the assembly.\rHe very soon returned to D---- He was interrogated as to this speedy return, and he replied:\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469528, "end": 1639728728, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [1, 0], "scores_total": 1, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728762, "snapshot": "1639469528", "state": "closed", "author": "0x72978D02Cb8Afb745D53a8A6088FF928b2955107", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x68c2b56ed2efdcb4dc7cce693c9d82dfeb1bcc0b08eee898306a3f128a2d90df", "voter": "0x97432c12ea8C957C3aE2d59c9953CF8dF9CBc5b0", "created": 1639489589, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alexec.eth"}}]}
