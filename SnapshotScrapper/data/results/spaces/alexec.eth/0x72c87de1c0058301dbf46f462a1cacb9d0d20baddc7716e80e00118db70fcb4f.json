For money?\"\r\"Who are you?\" demanded the master of the house.\rThe man replied:\r\"I have just come from Puy-Moisson. I have walked all day long.\rI have travelled twelve leagues.\rCan you?-- if I pay?\"\r\"I would not refuse,\" said the peasant, \"to lodge any respectable man who would pay me.\rBut why do you not go to the inn?\"\r\"There is no room.\"\r\"Bah!\rImpossible.\rThis is neither a fair nor a market day. Have you been to Labarre?\"\r\"Yes.\"\r\"Well?\"\rThe traveller replied with embarrassment:\r\"I do not know. He did not receive me.\"\r\"Have you been to What's-his-name's, in the Rue Chaffaut?\"\rThe stranger's embarrassment increased; he stammered, \"He did not receive me either.\"\rThe peasant's countenance assumed an expression of distrust; he surveyed the newcomer from head to feet, and suddenly exclaimed, with a sort of shudder:--\r\"Are you the man?--\"\rHe cast a fresh glance upon the stranger, took three steps backwards, placed the lamp on the table, and took his gun down from the wall.\rMeanwhile, at the words, Are you the man? the woman had risen, had clasped her two children in her arms, and had taken refuge precipitately behind her husband, staring in terror at the stranger, with her bosom uncovered, and with frightened eyes, as she murmured in a low tone, \"Tso-maraude.\"[1]\r [1] Patois of the French Alps:\rchat de maraude, rascally marauder.\r All this took place in less time than it requires to picture it to one's self.\rAfter having scrutinized the man for several moments, as one scrutinizes a viper, the master of the house returned to the door and said:--\r\"Clear out!\"\r\"For pity's sake, a glass of water,\" said the man.\r\"A shot from my gun!\" said the peasant.\rThen he closed the door violently, and the man heard him shoot two large bolts.\rA moment later, the window-shutter was closed, and the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside.\rNight continued to fall.\rA cold wind from the Alps was blowing. By the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived, in one of the gardens which bordered the street, a sort of hut, which seemed to him to be built of sods.\rHe climbed over the wooden fence resolutely, and found himself in the garden.\rHe approached the hut; its door consisted of a very low and narrow aperture, and it resembled those buildings which road-laborers construct for themselves along the roads.\rHe thought without doubt, that it was, in fact, the dwelling of a road-laborer; he was suffering from cold and hunger, but this was, at least, a shelter from the cold. This sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night.\rHe threw himself flat on his face, and crawled into the hut.\rIt was warm there, and he found a tolerably good bed of straw.\rHe lay, for a moment, stretched out on this bed, without the power to make a movement, so fatigued was he.\rThen, as the knapsack on his back was in his way, and as it furnished, moreover, a pillow ready to his hand, he set about unbuckling one of the straps.\rAt that moment, a ferocious growl became audible.\rHe raised his eyes.\rThe head of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut.\rIt was a dog's kennel.\rHe was himself vigorous and formidable; he armed himself with his staff, made a shield of his knapsack, and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could, not without enlarging the rents in his rags.\rHe left the garden in the same manner, but backwards, being obliged, in order to keep the dog respectful, to have recourse to that manoeuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as la rose couverte.\rWhen he had, not without difficulty, repassed the fence, and found himself once more in the street, alone, without refuge, without shelter, without a roof over his head, chased even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel, he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone, and it appears that a passer-by heard him exclaim, \"I am not even a dog!\"\rHe soon rose again and resumed his march.\rHe went out of the town, hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford him shelter.\rHe walked thus for some time, with his head still drooping. When he felt himself far from every human habitation, he raised his eyes and gazed searchingly about him.\rHe was in a field. Before him was one of those low hills covered with close-cut stubble, which, after the harvest, resemble shaved heads.\rThe horizon was perfectly black.\rThis was not alone the obscurity of night; it was caused by very low-hanging clouds which seemed to rest upon the hill itself, and which were mounting and filling the whole sky.\rMeanwhile, as the moon was about to rise, and as there was still floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight, these clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch, whence a gleam of light fell upon the earth.\rThe earth was thus better lighted than the sky, which produces a particularly sinister effect, and the hill, whose contour was poor and mean, was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon. The whole effect was hideous, petty, lugubrious, and narrow.\rThere was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree, which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer.\rThis man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious aspects of things; nevertheless, there was something in that sky, in that hill, in that plain, in that tree, which was so profoundly desolate, that after a moment of immobility and revery he turned back abruptly.\rThere are instants when nature seems hostile.\rHe retraced his steps; the gates of D---- were closed.\rD----, which had sustained sieges during the wars of religion, was still surrounded in 1815 by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been demolished since.\rHe passed through a breach and entered the town again.\rIt might have been eight o'clock in the evening.\rAs he was not acquainted with the streets, he recommenced his walk at random.\rIn this way he came to the prefecture, then to the seminary. As he passed through the Cathedral Square, he shook his fist at the church.\rAt the corner of this square there is a printing establishment. It is there that the proclamations of the Emperor and of the Imperial Guard to the army, brought from the Island of Elba and dictated by Napoleon himself, were printed for the first time.\rWorn out with fatigue, and no longer entertaining any hope, he lay down on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office.\rAt that moment an old woman came out of the church.\rShe saw the man stretched out in the shadow.\r\"What are you doing there, my friend?\" said she.\rHe answered harshly and angrily:\r\"As you see, my good woman, I am sleeping.\"\rThe good woman, who was well worthy the name, in fact, was the Marquise de R----\r\"On this bench?\" she went on.\r\"I have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years,\" said the man; \"to-day I have a mattress of stone.\"\r\"You have been a soldier?\"\r\"Yes, my good woman, a soldier.\"\r\"Why do you not go to the inn?\"\r\"Because I have no money.\"\r\"Alas!\" said Madame de R----, \"I have only four sous in my purse.\"\r\"Give it to me all the same.\"\rThe man took the four sous.\rMadame de R---- continued:\r\"You cannot obtain lodgings in an inn for so small a sum.\rBut have you tried? It is impossible for you to pass the night thus.\rYou are cold and hungry, no doubt.\rSome one might have given you a lodging out of charity.\"\r\"I have knocked at all doors.\"\r\"Well?\"\r\"I have been driven away everywhere.\"\rThe \"good woman\" touched the man's arm, and pointed out to him on the other side of the street a small, low house, which stood beside the Bishop's palace.\r\"You have knocked at all doors?\"\r\"Yes.\"\r\"Have you knocked at that one?\"\r\"No.\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639645961, "end": 1639905161, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905171, "snapshot": "1639645961", "state": "closed", "author": "0xc6a0768d97Ae675Fbd9086feA49f3E86431d8996", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
