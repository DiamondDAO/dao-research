They must be a great trouble.\rI would not have all those superfluities, crying incessantly in my ears:\r`There are people who are hungry! There are people who are cold!\rTheir prosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes, into nice little promotions.\rThe larger the diocese of the patron, the fatter the curacy for the favorite.\rAnd then, there is Rome.\rA bishop who understands how to become an archbishop, an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal, carries you with him as conclavist; you enter a court of papal jurisdiction, you receive the pallium, and behold! you are an auditor, then a papal chamberlain, then monsignor, and from a Grace to an Eminence is only a step, and between the Eminence and the Holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot.\rEvery skull-cap may dream of the tiara. The priest is nowadays the only man who can become a king in a regular manner; and what a king! the supreme king.\rThen what a nursery of aspirations is a seminary!\rHow many blushing choristers, how many youthful abbes bear on their heads Perrette's pot of milk! Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation? in good faith, perchance, and deceiving itself, devotee that it is.\rMonseigneur Bienvenu, poor, humble, retiring, was not accounted among the big mitres.\rThis was plain from the complete absence of young priests about him.\rWe have seen that he \"did not take\" in Paris.\rNot a single future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man.\rNot a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow.\rHis canons and grand-vicars were good old men, rather vulgar like himself, walled up like him in this diocese, without exit to a cardinalship, and who resembled their bishop, with this difference, that they were finished and he was completed.\rThe impossibility of growing great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so well understood, that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix or of Auch, and went off in a great hurry.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469551, "end": 1639728751, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [1, 0], "scores_total": 1, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728762, "snapshot": "1639469551", "state": "closed", "author": "0x039a974Fc53de3A4079979e051aB129DF20Daf9d", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x1c1511e846d9d4416ece7a4718d180683de99160d091127245f995b988778d89", "voter": "0x97432c12ea8C957C3aE2d59c9953CF8dF9CBc5b0", "created": 1639489536, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alexec.eth"}}]}
