Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by the Revolution.\rHis sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs, which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage.\rM. Myriel received from the State, in his quality of bishop, a salary of fifteen thousand francs.\rThis seam took the form of a cross. The Bishop often called attention to it:\r\"How delightful that is!\" he said.\rAll the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals.\rHowever, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over, paintings, ornamenting the apartment of Mademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall see further on. Before becoming a hospital, this house had been the ancient parliament house of the Bourgeois.\rHence this decoration. The chambers were paved in red bricks, which were washed every week, with straw mats in front of all the beds.\rAltogether, this dwelling, which was attended to by the two women, was exquisitely clean from top to bottom.\rThis was the sole luxury which the Bishop permitted. He said, \"That takes nothing from the poor.\"\rIt must be confessed, however, that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle, which Madame Magloire contemplated every day with delight, as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth. And since we are now painting the Bishop of D---- as he was in reality, we must add that he had said more than once, \"I find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes.\"\rTo this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver, which he had inherited from a great-aunt. These candlesticks held two wax candles, and usually figured on the Bishop's chimney-piece. When he had any one to dinner, Madame Magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table.\rIn the Bishop's own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was a small cupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night. But it is necessary to add, that the key was never removed.\r\"Egad, Bishop, let's have a discussion.\rThe senator was encouraged, and went on:--\r\"Let us be good fellows.\"\r\"Good devils even,\" said the Bishop.\r\"I declare to you,\" continued the senator, \"that the Marquis d'Argens, Pyrrhon, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are no rascals. I have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges.\"\r\"Like yourself, Count,\" interposed the Bishop.\rThe senator resumed:--\r\"I hate Diderot; he is an ideologist, a declaimer, and a revolutionist, a believer in God at bottom, and more bigoted than Voltaire. Voltaire made sport of Needham, and he was wrong, for Needham's eels prove that God is useless.\rA drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux.\rSuppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger; you have the world.\rMan is the eel. Then what is the good of the Eternal Father?\r\"You did not vote for the death of the king, after all.\"\rThe old member of the Convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words \"after all.\"\rHe replied. The smile had quite disappeared from his face.\r\"Do not congratulate me too much, sir.\rI did vote for the death of the tyrant.\"\rIt was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity.\r\"What do you mean to say?\" resumed the Bishop.\r\"I mean to say that man has a tyrant,--ignorance.\rI voted for the death of that tyrant.\rThat tyrant engendered royalty, which is authority falsely understood, while science is authority rightly understood. Man should be governed only by science.\"\r\"And conscience,\" added the Bishop.\r\"It is the same thing.\rConscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us.\"\rMonseigneur Bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language, which was very new to him.\rThe member of the Convention resumed:--\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639645817, "end": 1639905017, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905051, "snapshot": "1639645817", "state": "closed", "author": "0x962caDc93e01f800B9CB2f834a9054787BBb2032", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
