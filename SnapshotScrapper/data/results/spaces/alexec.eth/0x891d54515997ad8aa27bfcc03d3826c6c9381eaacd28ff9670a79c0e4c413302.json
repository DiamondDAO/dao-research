Win in the lottery, and behold! you are a clever man.\rHe who triumphs is venerated.\rBe born with a silver spoon in your mouth! everything lies in that.\rBe lucky, and you will have all the rest; be happy, and people will think you great.\rOutside of five or six immense exceptions, which compose the splendor of a century, contemporary admiration is nothing but short-sightedness. Gilding is gold.\rIt does no harm to be the first arrival by pure chance, so long as you do arrive.\rThe common herd is an old Narcissus who adores himself, and who applauds the vulgar herd.\rThat enormous ability by virtue of which one is Moses, Aeschylus, Dante, Michael Angelo, or Napoleon, the multitude awards on the spot, and by acclamation, to whomsoever attains his object, in whatsoever it may consist. Let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy:\rlet a false Corneille compose Tiridate; let a eunuch come to possess a harem; let a military Prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch; let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe-soles for the army of the Sambre-and-Meuse, and construct for himself, out of this cardboard, sold as leather, four hundred thousand francs of income; let a pork-packer espouse usury, and cause it to bring forth seven or eight millions, of which he is the father and of which it is the mother; let a preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl; let the steward of a fine family be so rich on retiring from service that he is made minister of finances,--and men call that Genius, just as they call the face of Mousqueton Beauty, and the mien of Claude Majesty.\rWith the constellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which are made in the soft mire of the puddle by the feet of ducks.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER XIII \rWHAT HE BELIEVED\r We are not obliged to sound the Bishop of D---- on the score of orthodoxy.\rIn the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect.\rThe conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word.\rWHAT HE THOUGHT\r One last word.\rSince this sort of details might, particularly at the present moment, and to use an expression now in fashion, give to the Bishop of D---- a certain \"pantheistical\" physiognomy, and induce the belief, either to his credit or discredit, that he entertained one of those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century, which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits, and there take on a form and grow until they usurp the place of religion, we insist upon it, that not one of those persons who knew Monseigneur Welcome would have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort. That which enlightened this man was his heart.\rHis wisdom was made of the light which comes from there.\rEarly in the month of October, 1815, about an hour before sunset, a man who was travelling on foot entered the little town of D---- The few inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness. It was difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance. He was a man of medium stature, thickset and robust, in the prime of life.\rHe might have been forty-six or forty-eight years old. A cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face, burned and tanned by sun and wind, and dripping with perspiration. His shirt of coarse yellow linen, fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitted a view of his hairy breast:\rhe had a cravat twisted into a string; trousers of blue drilling, worn and threadbare, white on one knee and torn on the other; an old gray, tattered blouse, patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with twine; a tightly packed soldier knapsack, well buckled and perfectly new, on his back; an enormous, knotty stick in his hand; iron-shod shoes on his stockingless feet; a shaved head and a long beard.\rThe sweat, the heat, the journey on foot, the dust, added I know not what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole.\rHis hair was closely cut, yet bristling, for it had begun to grow a little, and did not seem to have been cut for some time.\rNo one knew him.\rHe was evidently only a chance passer-by. Whence came he?\rFrom the south; from the seashore, perhaps, for he made his entrance into D---- by the same street which, seven months previously, had witnessed the passage of the Emperor Napoleon on his way from Cannes to Paris.\rThis man must have been walking all day. He seemed very much fatigued.\rSome women of the ancient market town which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard Gassendi, and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade.\rHe must have been very thirsty: for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink, two hundred paces further on, at the fountain in the market-place.\rOn arriving at the corner of the Rue Poichevert, he turned to the left, and directed his steps toward the town-hall. He entered, then came out a quarter of an hour later.\rA gendarme was seated near the door, on the stone bench which General Drouot had mounted on the 4th of March to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of D---- the proclamation of the Gulf Juan.\rThe man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the gendarme.\rThe gendarme, without replying to his salute, stared attentively at him, followed him for a while with his eyes, and then entered the town-hall.\rThere then existed at D---- a fine inn at the sign of the Cross of Colbas.\rThis inn had for a landlord a certain Jacquin Labarre, a man of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another Labarre, who kept the inn of the Three Dauphins in Grenoble, and had served in the Guides.\rAt the time of the Emperor's landing, many rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the Three Dauphins.\rIt was said that General Bertrand, disguised as a carter, had made frequent trips thither in the month of January, and that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls of gold to the citizens.\rThe truth is, that when the Emperor entered Grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture; he had thanked the mayor, saying, \"I am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance\"; and he had betaken himself to the Three Dauphins.\rThis glory of the Labarre of the Three Dauphins was reflected upon the Labarre of the Cross of Colbas, at a distance of five and twenty leagues. It was said of him in the town, \"That is the cousin of the man of Grenoble.\"\rThe man bent his steps towards this inn, which was the best in the country-side. He entered the kitchen, which opened on a level with the street.\rAll the stoves were lighted; a huge fire blazed gayly in the fireplace.\rThe host, who was also the chief cook, was going from one stew-pan to another, very busily superintending an excellent dinner designed for the wagoners, whose loud talking, conversation, and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment. Any one who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoners.\rA fat marmot, flanked by white partridges and heather-cocks, was turning on a long spit before the fire; on the stove, two huge carps from Lake Lauzet and a trout from Lake Alloz were cooking.\rThe host, hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter, said, without raising his eyes from his stoves:--\r\"What do you wish, sir?\"\r\"Food and lodging,\" said the man.\r\"Nothing easier,\" replied the host.\rAt that moment he turned his head, took in the traveller's appearance with a single glance, and added, \"By paying for it.\"\rThe man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse, and answered, \"I have money.\"\r\"In that case, we are at your service,\" said the host.\rThe man put his purse back in his pocket, removed his knapsack from his back, put it on the ground near the door, retained his stick in his hand, and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire. D---- is in the mountains.\rThe evenings are cold there in October.\rBut as the host went back and forth, he scrutinized the traveller.\r\"Will dinner be ready soon?\" said the man.\r\"Immediately,\" replied the landlord.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639645937, "end": 1639905137, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905171, "snapshot": "1639645937", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4c38e4444Cf28eAd9C5d5f261214Dd8299eE1190", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
