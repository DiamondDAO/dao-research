Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town, where there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think. He was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and because he was a bishop.\rBut after all, the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only,--noise, sayings, words; less than words-- palabres, as the energetic language of the South expresses it.\rHowever that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in D----, all the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion.\rNo one would have dared to mention them; no one would have dared to recall them.\rM. Myriel had arrived at D---- accompanied by an elderly spinster, Mademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his junior.\rTheir only domestic was a female servant of the same age as Mademoiselle Baptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having been the servant of M. le Cure, now assumed the double title of maid to Mademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.\rMademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; she realized the ideal expressed by the word \"respectable\"; for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. She had never been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen. She was a soul rather than a virgin.\rHer person seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever drooping;-- a mere pretext for a soul's remaining on the earth.\rMadame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and bustling; always out of breath,--in the first place, because of her activity, and in the next, because of her asthma.\rOn his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop immediately after a major-general. The mayor and the president paid the first call on him, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the general and the prefect.\rThe installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER II \rM. MYRIEL BECOMES M. WELCOME \rThe episcopal palace of D---- adjoins the hospital.\rThe episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone at the beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology of the Faculty of Paris, Abbe of Simore, who had been Bishop of D---- in 1712.\rThis palace was a genuine seignorial residence. Everything about it had a grand air,--the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms, the chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks encircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens planted with magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superb gallery which was situated on the ground-floor and opened on the gardens, M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, My Lords Charles Brulart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d'Embrun; Antoine de Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendome, Grand Prior of France, Abbe of Saint Honore de Lerins; Francois de Berton de Crillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; Cesar de Sabran de Forcalquier, bishop, Seignor of Glandeve; and Jean Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, preacher in ordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of Senez. The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment; and this memorable date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble.\rThe hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with a small garden.\rThree days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. The visit ended, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house.\r\"Monsieur the director of the hospital,\" said he to him, \"how many sick people have you at the present moment?\"\r\"Twenty-six, Monseigneur.\"\r\"That was the number which I counted,\" said the Bishop.\r\"The beds,\" pursued the director, \"are very much crowded against each other.\"\r\"That is what I observed.\"\r\"The halls are nothing but rooms, and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them.\"\r\"So it seems to me.\"\r\"And then, when there is a ray of sun, the garden is very small for the convalescents.\"\r\"That was what I said to myself.\"\r\"In case of epidemics,--we have had the typhus fever this year; we had the sweating sickness two years ago, and a hundred patients at times,--we know not what to do.\"\r\"That is the thought which occurred to me.\"\r\"What would you have, Monseigneur?\" said the director.\r\"One must resign one's self.\"\rThis conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on the ground-floor.\rThe Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital.\r\"Monsieur,\" said he, \"how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold?\"\r\"Monseigneur's dining-room?\" exclaimed the stupefied director.\rThe Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes.\r\"It would hold full twenty beds,\" said he, as though speaking to himself.\rThen, raising his voice:--\r\"Hold, Monsieur the director of the hospital, I will tell you something. There is evidently a mistake here.\rThere are thirty-six of you, in five or six small rooms.\rThere are three of us here, and we have room for sixty.\rThere is some mistake, I tell you; you have my house, and I have yours.\rGive me back my house; you are at home here.\"\rOn the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in the Bishop's palace, and the Bishop was settled in the hospital.\rM. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by the Revolution.\rHis sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs, which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage.\rM. Myriel received from the State, in his quality of bishop, a salary of fifteen thousand francs.\rOn the very day when he took up his abode in the hospital, M. Myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all, in the following manner. We transcribe here a note made by his own hand:--\r NOTE ON THE REGULATION OF MY HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469316, "end": 1639728516, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [1, 0], "scores_total": 1, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728522, "snapshot": "1639469316", "state": "closed", "author": "0x32FCdAC44Acce0757C588c7db03d4CFa70F00930", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x1fd3ef05a49456c45ce0621eddbd86ac57a67eadf94380b83fe464b8dbff0afb", "voter": "0x97432c12ea8C957C3aE2d59c9953CF8dF9CBc5b0", "created": 1639489869, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alexec.eth"}}]}
