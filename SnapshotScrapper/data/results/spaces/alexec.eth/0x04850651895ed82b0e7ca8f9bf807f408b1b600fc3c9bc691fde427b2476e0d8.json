I have travelled twelve leagues.\rI pay.\rI wish to eat.\"\r\"I have nothing,\" said the landlord.\rThe man burst out laughing, and turned towards the fireplace and the stoves:\r\"Nothing! and all that?\"\r\"All that is engaged.\"\r\"By whom?\"\r\"By messieurs the wagoners.\"\r\"How many are there of them?\"\r\"Twelve.\"\r\"There is enough food there for twenty.\"\r\"They have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance.\"\rThe man seated himself again, and said, without raising his voice, \"I am at an inn; I am hungry, and I shall remain.\"\rThen the host bent down to his ear, and said in a tone which made him start, \"Go away!\"\rAt that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brands into the fire with the iron-shod tip of his staff; he turned quickly round, and as he opened his mouth to reply, the host gazed steadily at him and added, still in a low voice: \"Stop! there's enough of that sort of talk.\rDo you want me to tell you your name?\rYour name is Jean Valjean.\rNow do you want me to tell you who you are?\rWhen I saw you come in I suspected something; I sent to the town-hall, and this was the reply that was sent to me. Can you read?\"\rSo saying, he held out to the stranger, fully unfolded, the paper which had just travelled from the inn to the town-hall, and from the town-hall to the inn.\rThe man cast a glance upon it. The landlord resumed after a pause.\r\"I am in the habit of being polite to every one.\rGo away!\"\rThe man dropped his head, picked up the knapsack which he had deposited on the ground, and took his departure.\rHe chose the principal street.\rHe walked straight on at a venture, keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man. He did not turn round a single time.\rHad he done so, he would have seen the host of the Cross of Colbas standing on his threshold, surrounded by all the guests of his inn, and all the passers-by in the street, talking vivaciously, and pointing him out with his finger; and, from the glances of terror and distrust cast by the group, he might have divined that his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town.\rHe saw nothing of all this.\rPeople who are crushed do not look behind them.\rThey know but too well the evil fate which follows them.\rThus he proceeded for some time, walking on without ceasing, traversing at random streets of which he knew nothing, forgetful of his fatigue, as is often the case when a man is sad.\rAll at once he felt the pangs of hunger sharply.\rNight was drawing near. He glanced about him, to see whether he could not discover some shelter.\rThe fine hostelry was closed to him; he was seeking some very humble public house, some hovel, however lowly.\rJust then a light flashed up at the end of the streets; a pine branch suspended from a cross-beam of iron was outlined against the white sky of the twilight.\rHe proceeded thither.\rIt proved to be, in fact, a public house.\rThe public house which is in the Rue de Chaffaut.\rThe wayfarer halted for a moment, and peeped through the window into the interior of the low-studded room of the public house, illuminated by a small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth.\rSome men were engaged in drinking there.\rThe landlord was warming himself. An iron pot, suspended from a crane, bubbled over the flame.\rThe entrance to this public house, which is also a sort of an inn, is by two doors.\rOne opens on the street, the other upon a small yard filled with manure.\rThe traveller dare not enter by the street door. He slipped into the yard, halted again, then raised the latch timidly and opened the door.\r\"Who goes there?\" said the master.\r\"Some one who wants supper and bed.\"\r\"Good.\rWe furnish supper and bed here.\"\rHe entered.\rAll the men who were drinking turned round. The lamp illuminated him on one side, the firelight on the other. They examined him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack.\rThe host said to him, \"There is the fire.\rThe supper is cooking in the pot.\rCome and warm yourself, comrade.\"\rHe approached and seated himself near the hearth.\rHe stretched out his feet, which were exhausted with fatigue, to the fire; a fine odor was emitted by the pot.\rAll that could be distinguished of his face, beneath his cap, which was well pulled down, assumed a vague appearance of comfort, mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual suffering bestows.\rIt was, moreover, a firm, energetic, and melancholy profile. This physiognomy was strangely composed; it began by seeming humble, and ended by seeming severe.\rThe eye shone beneath its lashes like a fire beneath brushwood.\rOne of the men seated at the table, however, was a fishmonger who, before entering the public house of the Rue de Chaffaut, had been to stable his horse at Labarre's. It chanced that he had that very morning encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between Bras d'Asse and--I have forgotten the name. I think it was Escoublon.\rNow, when he met him, the man, who then seemed already extremely weary, had requested him to take him on his crupper; to which the fishmonger had made no reply except by redoubling his gait.\rThis fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded Jacquin Labarre, and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the Cross of Colbas.\rFrom where he sat he made an imperceptible sign to the tavern-keeper. The tavern-keeper went to him.\rThey exchanged a few words in a low tone.\rThe man had again become absorbed in his reflections.\rThe tavern-keeper returned to the fireplace, laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man, and said to him:--\r\"You are going to get out of here.\"\rThe stranger turned round and replied gently, \"Ah!\rYou know?--\"\r\"Yes.\"\r\"I was sent away from the other inn.\"\r\"And you are to be turned out of this one.\"\r\"Where would you have me go?\"\r\"Elsewhere.\"\rThe man took his stick and his knapsack and departed.\rAs he went out, some children who had followed him from the Cross of Colbas, and who seemed to be lying in wait for him, threw stones at him.\rHe retraced his steps in anger, and threatened them with his stick:\rthe children dispersed like a flock of birds.\rHe passed before the prison.\rAt the door hung an iron chain attached to a bell.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639645949, "end": 1639905149, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905171, "snapshot": "1639645949", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1e3f081e69e5d08FA8Df7F06351501938D345bea", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
