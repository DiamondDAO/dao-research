She had numerous relatives, who were very old and near to death, and of whom her sons were the natural heirs.\rThe youngest of the three was to receive from a grand-aunt a good hundred thousand livres of income; the second was the heir by entail to the title of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather.\rThe Bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts.\rOn one occasion, however, he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual, while Madame de Lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these \"expectations.\"\rWhen the Bishop came to him, he touched his arm, \"You must give me something, M. le Marquis.\" The Marquis turned round and answered dryly, \"I have poor people of my own, Monseigneur.\"\r\"Give them to me,\" replied the Bishop.\rOne day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral:--\r \"My very dear brethren, my good friends, there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants' dwellings in France which have but three openings; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings, the door and one window; and three hundred and forty-six thousand cabins besides which have but one opening, the door.\rAnd this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows.\rJust put poor families, old women and little children, in those buildings, and behold the fevers and maladies which result!\rAlas!\rGod gives air to men; the law sells it to them. I do not blame the law, but I bless God.\rIn the department of the Isere, in the Var, in the two departments of the Alpes, the Hautes, and the Basses, the peasants have not even wheelbarrows; they transport their manure on the backs of men; they have no candles, and they burn resinous sticks, and bits of rope dipped in pitch. That is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of Dauphine.\rThey make bread for six months at one time; they bake it with dried cow-dung. In the winter they break this bread up with an axe, and they soak it for twenty-four hours, in order to render it eatable.\rMy brethren, have pity! behold the suffering on all sides of you!\"\rBorn a Provencal, he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south.\rHe said, \"En be! moussu, ses sage?\" as in lower Languedoc; \"Onte anaras passa?\" as in the Basses-Alpes; \"Puerte un bouen moutu embe un bouen fromage grase,\" as in upper Dauphine.\rThis pleased the people extremely, and contributed not a little to win him access to all spirits.\rHe was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains.\rHe understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms.\rAs he spoke all tongues, he entered into all hearts.\rMoreover, he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes.\rHe condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account.\rHe said, \"Examine the road over which the fault has passed.\"\rBeing, as he described himself with a smile, an ex-sinner, he had none of the asperities of austerity, and he professed, with a good deal of distinctness, and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous, a doctrine which may be summed up as follows:--\r\"Man has upon him his flesh, which is at once his burden and his temptation.\rHe drags it with him and yields to it. He must watch it, cheek it, repress it, and obey it only at the last extremity.\rThere may be some fault even in this obedience; but the fault thus committed is venial; it is a fall, but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer.\r\"To be a saint is the exception; to be an upright man is the rule. Err, fall, sin if you will, but be upright.\r\"The least possible sin is the law of man.\rNo sin at all is the dream of the angel.\rAll which is terrestrial is subject to sin. Sin is a gravitation.\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469375, "end": 1639728575, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728582, "snapshot": "1639469375", "state": "closed", "author": "0x23C3D290dD2a3cCBc53E8c7AdbC367DFEd41747f", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
