He said, \"That takes nothing from the poor.\"\rIt must be confessed, however, that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle, which Madame Magloire contemplated every day with delight, as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth. And since we are now painting the Bishop of D---- as he was in reality, we must add that he had said more than once, \"I find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes.\"\rTo this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver, which he had inherited from a great-aunt. These candlesticks held two wax candles, and usually figured on the Bishop's chimney-piece. When he had any one to dinner, Madame Magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table.\rIn the Bishop's own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was a small cupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night. But it is necessary to add, that the key was never removed.\rThe garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned, was composed of four alleys in cross-form, radiating from a tank.\rAnother walk made the circuit of the garden, and skirted the white wall which enclosed it.\rThese alleys left behind them four square plots rimmed with box.\rIn three of these, Madame Magloire cultivated vegetables; in the fourth, the Bishop had planted some flowers; here and there stood a few fruit-trees. Madame Magloire had once remarked, with a sort of gentle malice: \"Monseigneur, you who turn everything to account, have, nevertheless, one useless plot.\rIt would be better to grow salads there than bouquets.\" \"Madame Magloire,\" retorted the Bishop, \"you are mistaken. The beautiful is as useful as the useful.\"\rHe added after a pause, \"More so, perhaps.\"\rThen, turning to his sister:\r\"Sister, never a precaution on the part of the priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, God permits.\rLet us confine ourselves to prayer, when we think that a danger is approaching us.\r\"It is the same thing.\rConscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us.\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469563, "end": 1639728763, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [1, 0], "scores_total": 1, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728792, "snapshot": "1639469563", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb32a57318d074A80BB7291e63dB646911eA11cAC", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x7ed83edffd7e7268db47b953280a3e9d460155b1c315366da28cda83281a7d15", "voter": "0x97432c12ea8C957C3aE2d59c9953CF8dF9CBc5b0", "created": 1639489511, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alexec.eth"}}]}
