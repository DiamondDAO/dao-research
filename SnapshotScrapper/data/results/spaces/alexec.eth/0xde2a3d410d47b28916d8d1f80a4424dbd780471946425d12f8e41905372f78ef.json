Success; that is the lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption.\rBe it said in passing, that success is a very hideous thing.\rIts false resemblance to merit deceives men.\rFor the masses, success has almost the same profile as supremacy.\rSuccess, that Menaechmus of talent, has one dupe,--history.\rJuvenal and Tacitus alone grumble at it. In our day, a philosophy which is almost official has entered into its service, wears the livery of success, and performs the service of its antechamber.\rSucceed:\rtheory.\rProsperity argues capacity. Win in the lottery, and behold! you are a clever man.\rHe who triumphs is venerated.\rBe born with a silver spoon in your mouth! everything lies in that.\rBe lucky, and you will have all the rest; be happy, and people will think you great.\rOutside of five or six immense exceptions, which compose the splendor of a century, contemporary admiration is nothing but short-sightedness. Gilding is gold.\rIt does no harm to be the first arrival by pure chance, so long as you do arrive.\rThe common herd is an old Narcissus who adores himself, and who applauds the vulgar herd.\rThat enormous ability by virtue of which one is Moses, Aeschylus, Dante, Michael Angelo, or Napoleon, the multitude awards on the spot, and by acclamation, to whomsoever attains his object, in whatsoever it may consist. Let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy:\rlet a false Corneille compose Tiridate; let a eunuch come to possess a harem; let a military Prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch; let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe-soles for the army of the Sambre-and-Meuse, and construct for himself, out of this cardboard, sold as leather, four hundred thousand francs of income; let a pork-packer espouse usury, and cause it to bring forth seven or eight millions, of which he is the father and of which it is the mother; let a preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl; let the steward of a fine family be so rich on retiring from service that he is made minister of finances,--and men call that Genius, just as they call the face of Mousqueton Beauty, and the mien of Claude Majesty.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469587, "end": 1639728787, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [1, 0], "scores_total": 1, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728822, "snapshot": "1639469587", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb3c59D74085523e95A2aEe99984ACb1eF1A8e4ab", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x803f811a79aa44e22d7d0e0a6c4459d02c2a41fed38060adf31387b92575dc87", "voter": "0x97432c12ea8C957C3aE2d59c9953CF8dF9CBc5b0", "created": 1639489474, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alexec.eth"}}]}
