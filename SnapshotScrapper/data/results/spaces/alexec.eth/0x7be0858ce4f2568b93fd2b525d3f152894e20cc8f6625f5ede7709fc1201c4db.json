He respected learned men greatly; he respected the ignorant still more; and, without ever failing in these two respects, he watered his flower-beds every summer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green.\rThe house had not a single door which could be locked.\rThe door of the dining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the cathedral square, had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison.\rThe Bishop had had all this ironwork removed, and this door was never fastened, either by night or by day, with anything except the latch.\rAll that the first passerby had to do at any hour, was to give it a push.\rAt first, the two women had been very much tried by this door, which was never fastened, but Monsieur de D---- had said to them, \"Have bolts put on your rooms, if that will please you.\"\rThey had ended by sharing his confidence, or by at least acting as though they shared it.\rMadame Magloire alone had frights from time to time.\rAs for the Bishop, his thought can be found explained, or at least indicated, in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a Bible, \"This is the shade of difference:\rthe door of the physician should never be shut, the door of the priest should always be open.\"\rOn another book, entitled Philosophy of the Medical Science, he had written this other note:\r\"Am not I a physician like them? I also have my patients, and then, too, I have some whom I call my unfortunates.\"\rAgain he wrote:\r\"Do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you.\rThe very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter.\"\rIt chanced that a worthy cure, I know not whether it was the cure of Couloubroux or the cure of Pompierry, took it into his head to ask him one day, probably at the instigation of Madame Magloire, whether Monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion, to a certain extent, in leaving his door unfastened day and night, at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter, and whether, in short, he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded.\rThe Bishop touched his shoulder, with gentle gravity, and said to him, \"Nisi Dominus custodierit domum, in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam,\" Unless the Lord guard the house, in vain do they watch who guard it.\rThen he spoke of something else.\rHe was fond of saying, \"There is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of dragoons,--only,\" he added, \"ours must be tranquil.\"\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER VII \rCRAVATTE \r It is here that a fact falls naturally into place, which we must not omit, because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a man the Bishop of D---- was.\rAfter the destruction of the band of Gaspard Bes, who had infested the gorges of Ollioules, one of his lieutenants, Cravatte, took refuge in the mountains.\rHe concealed himself for some time with his bandits, the remnant of Gaspard Bes's troop, in the county of Nice; then he made his way to Piedmont, and suddenly reappeared in France, in the vicinity of Barcelonette.\rHe was first seen at Jauziers, then at Tuiles.\r\"An old goodman of a priest, who passes along mumbling his prayers? Bah!\rTo what purpose?\"\r\"Oh, mon Dieu! what if you should meet them!\"\r\"I should beg alms of them for my poor.\"\r\"Do not go, Monseigneur.\rIn the name of Heaven!\rYou are risking your life!\"\r\"Monsieur le maire,\" said the Bishop, \"is that really all? I am not in the world to guard my own life, but to guard souls.\"\rThey had to allow him to do as he pleased.\rHe set out, accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide.\rHis obstinacy was bruited about the country-side, and caused great consternation.\rHe would take neither his sister nor Madame Magloire.\rHe traversed the mountain on mule-back, encountered no one, and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his \"good friends,\" the shepherds. He remained there for a fortnight, preaching, administering the sacrament, teaching, exhorting.\rWhen the time of his departure approached, he resolved to chant a Te Deum pontifically.\rHe mentioned it to the cure.\rBut what was to be done?\rThere were no episcopal ornaments. They could only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy, with a few ancient chasubles of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace.\r\"Bah!\" said the Bishop.\r\"Let us announce our Te Deum from the pulpit, nevertheless, Monsieur le Cure.\rThings will arrange themselves.\"\rThey instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood. All the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly.\rWhile they were thus embarrassed, a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the Bishop, by two unknown horsemen, who departed on the instant.\rThe chest was opened; it contained a cope of cloth of gold, a mitre ornamented with diamonds, an archbishop's cross, a magnificent crosier,--all the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of Notre Dame d'Embrun. In the chest was a paper, on which these words were written, \"From Cravatte to Monseigneur Bienvenu.\"\r\"Did not I say that things would come right of themselves?\" said the Bishop.\rThen he added, with a smile, \"To him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop.\"\r\"Monseigneur,\" murmured the cure, throwing back his head with a smile. \"God--or the Devil.\"\rThe Bishop looked steadily at the cure, and repeated with authority, \"God!\"\rWhen he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity, all along the road.\rAt the priest's house in Chastelar he rejoined Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire, who were waiting for him, and he said to his sister:\r\"Well! was I in the right?\rThe poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands, and he returns from them with his hands full. I set out bearing only my faith in God; I have brought back the treasure of a cathedral.\"\rThat evening, before he went to bed, he said again:\r\"Let us never fear robbers nor murderers.\rThose are dangers from without, petty dangers.\rLet us fear ourselves.\rPrejudices are the real robbers; vices are the real murderers.\rThe great dangers lie within ourselves. What matters it what threatens our head or our purse!\rLet us think only of that which threatens our soul.\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469435, "end": 1639728635, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728642, "snapshot": "1639469435", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3801DfD0437fb12D2E71F474Dc43fBA95659874B", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
