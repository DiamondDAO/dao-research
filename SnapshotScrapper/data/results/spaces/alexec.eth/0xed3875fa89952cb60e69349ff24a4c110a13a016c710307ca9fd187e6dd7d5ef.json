It consisted of very handsome things, very tempting things, and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate.\rStolen they had already been elsewhere. Half of the adventure was completed; it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor.\rHowever, we make no assertions on this point.\rOnly, a rather obscure note was found among the Bishop's papers, which may bear some relation to this matter, and which is couched in these terms, \"The question is, to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital.\"\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER VIII \rPHILOSOPHY AFTER DRINKING \r The senator above mentioned was a clever man, who had made his own way, heedless of those things which present obstacles, and which are called conscience, sworn faith, justice, duty:\rhe had marched straight to his goal, without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest.\rHe was an old attorney, softened by success; not a bad man by any means, who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons, his sons-in-law, his relations, and even to his friends, having wisely seized upon, in life, good sides, good opportunities, good windfalls. Everything else seemed to him very stupid.\rHe was intelligent, and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of Epicurus; while he was, in reality, only a product of Pigault-Lebrun. He laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things, and at the \"Crotchets of that good old fellow the Bishop.\" He even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel himself, who listened to him.\rOn some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect what, Count*** [this senator] and M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect. At dessert, the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, though still perfectly dignified, exclaimed:--\r\"Egad, Bishop, let's have a discussion.\rIt is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking.\rWe are two augurs. I am going to make a confession to you.\rI have a philosophy of my own.\"\r\"And you are right,\" replied the Bishop.\r\"As one makes one's philosophy, so one lies on it.\rYou are on the bed of purple, senator.\"\rThe senator was encouraged, and went on:--\r\"Let us be good fellows.\"\r\"Good devils even,\" said the Bishop.\r\"I declare to you,\" continued the senator, \"that the Marquis d'Argens, Pyrrhon, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are no rascals. I have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges.\"\r\"Like yourself, Count,\" interposed the Bishop.\rThe senator resumed:--\r\"I hate Diderot; he is an ideologist, a declaimer, and a revolutionist, a believer in God at bottom, and more bigoted than Voltaire. Voltaire made sport of Needham, and he was wrong, for Needham's eels prove that God is useless.\rA drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux.\rSuppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger; you have the world.\rMan is the eel. Then what is the good of the Eternal Father?\rThe Jehovah hypothesis tires me, Bishop.\rThis philosophy has been extracted from the depths, and unearthed by special seekers.\rBut you are good-natured princes, and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good God should constitute the philosophy of the people, very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor.\"\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER IX \rTHE BROTHER AS DEPICTED BY THE SISTER\r In order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the Bishop of D----, and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions, their thoughts, their feminine instincts even, which are easily alarmed, to the habits and purposes of the Bishop, without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them, we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter from Mademoiselle Baptistine to Madame the Vicomtess de Boischevron, the friend of her childhood.\rThis letter is in our possession. \rI should go to the good God with my brother and my bishop.\rIt has cost Madam Magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences.\rBut now the habit has been acquired.\rWe pray together, we tremble together, and we fall asleep.\rIf the devil were to enter this house, he would be allowed to do so.\rAfter all, what is there for us to fear in this house?\rThere is always some one with us who is stronger than we.\rThe devil may pass through it, but the good God dwells here.\rThis suffices me.\rMy brother has no longer any need of saying a word to me.\rI understand him without his speaking, and we abandon ourselves to the care of Providence.\rThat is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul.\rI have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the Faux family.\rYou are aware that he knows everything, and that he has memories, because he is still a very good royalist.\rThey really are a very ancient Norman family of the generalship of Caen.\rFive hundred years ago there was a Raoul de Faux, a Jean de Faux, and a Thomas de Faux, who were gentlemen, and one of whom was a seigneur de Rochefort. The last was Guy-Etienne-Alexandre, and was commander of a regiment, and something in the light horse of Bretagne.\rHis daughter, Marie-Louise, married Adrien-Charles de Gramont, son of the Duke Louis de Gramont, peer of France, colonel of the French guards, and lieutenant-general of the army.\rIt is written Faux, Fauq, and Faoucq.\rGood Madame, recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative, Monsieur the Cardinal.\rAs for your dear Sylvanie, she has done well in not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me.\rShe is well, works as you would wish, and loves me.\rThat is all that I desire.\rThe souvenir which she sent through you reached me safely, and it makes me very happy.\rMy health is not so very bad, and yet I grow thinner every day.\rFarewell; my paper is at an end, and this forces me to leave you.\rA thousand good wishes. \r BAPTISTINE.\r P.S. Your grand nephew is charming.\rDo you know that he will soon be five years old?\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469470, "end": 1639728670, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728701, "snapshot": "1639469470", "state": "closed", "author": "0x240c36C1Ff9D74934828Dc6d1e489B029f761Ad4", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
