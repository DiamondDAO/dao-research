Whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother's room. He fears nothing, even at night.\rThat is his sort of bravery, he says.\rHe does not wish me or Madame Magloire feel any fear for him. He exposes himself to all sorts of dangers, and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it.\rOne must know how to understand him.\rHe goes out in the rain, he walks in the water, he travels in winter. He fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters, nor night.\r year he went quite alone into a country of robbers.\rHe would not take us.\rHe was absent for a fortnight.\rOn his return nothing had happened to him; he was thought to be dead, but was perfectly well, and said, \"This is the way I have been robbed!\"\rAnd then he opened a trunk full of jewels, all the jewels of the cathedral of Embrun, which the thieves had given him.\rWhen he returned on that occasion, I could not refrain from scolding him a little, taking care, however, not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise, so that no one might hear me.\rAt first I used to say to myself, \"There are no dangers which will stop him; he is terrible.\"\rNow I have ended by getting used to it. I make a sign to Madam Magloire that she is not to oppose him. He risks himself as he sees fit.\rI carry off Madam Magloire, I enter my chamber, I pray for him and fall asleep.\rI am at ease, because I know that if anything were to happen to him, it would be the end of me.\rI should go to the good God with my brother and my bishop.\rIt has cost Madam Magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences.\rBut now the habit has been acquired.\rWe pray together, we tremble together, and we fall asleep.\rIf the devil were to enter this house, he would be allowed to do so.\rAfter all, what is there for us to fear in this house?\rThere is always some one with us who is stronger than we.\rThe devil may pass through it, but the good God dwells here.\rThis suffices me.\rMy brother has no longer any need of saying a word to me.\rI understand him without his speaking, and we abandon ourselves to the care of Providence.\rThat is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul.\rI have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the Faux family.\rYou are aware that he knows everything, and that he has memories, because he is still a very good royalist.\rThey really are a very ancient Norman family of the generalship of Caen.\rFive hundred years ago there was a Raoul de Faux, a Jean de Faux, and a Thomas de Faux, who were gentlemen, and one of whom was a seigneur de Rochefort. The last was Guy-Etienne-Alexandre, and was commander of a regiment, and something in the light horse of Bretagne.\rHis daughter, Marie-Louise, married Adrien-Charles de Gramont, son of the Duke Louis de Gramont, peer of France, colonel of the French guards, and lieutenant-general of the army.\rIt is written Faux, Fauq, and Faoucq.\rGood Madame, recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative, Monsieur the Cardinal.\rAs for your dear Sylvanie, she has done well in not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me.\rShe is well, works as you would wish, and loves me.\rThat is all that I desire.\rThe souvenir which she sent through you reached me safely, and it makes me very happy.\rMy health is not so very bad, and yet I grow thinner every day.\rFarewell; my paper is at an end, and this forces me to leave you.\rA thousand good wishes. \r BAPTISTINE.\r P.S. Your grand nephew is charming.\rDo you know that he will soon be five years old?\rYesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback who had on knee-caps, and he said, \"What has he got on his knees?\" He is a charming child!\rHis little brother is dragging an old broom about the room, like a carriage, and saying, \"Hu!\"\r As will be perceived from this letter, these two women understood how to mould themselves to the Bishop's ways with that special feminine genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself. The Bishop of D----, in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him, sometimes did things that were grand, bold, and magnificent, without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact. They trembled, but they let him alone.\rSometimes Madame Magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance, but never at the time, nor afterwards. They never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign, in any action once entered upon.\rAt certain moments, without his having occasion to mention it, when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability, so perfect was his simplicity, they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop; then they were nothing more than two shadows in the house.\rThey served him passively; and if obedience consisted in disappearing, they disappeared. They understood, with an admirable delicacy of instinct, that certain cares may be put under constraint.\rThus, even when believing him to be in peril, they understood, I will not say his thought, but his nature, to such a degree that they no longer watched over him. They confided him to God.\rMoreover, Baptistine said, as we have just read, that her brother's end would prove her own.\rMadame Magloire did not say this, but she knew it.\r\r\rBOOK FIRST--A JUST MAN\rCHAPTER X \rTHE BISHOP IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNKNOWN LIGHT\r At an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the preceding pages, he did a thing which, if the whole town was to be believed, was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains infested with bandits.\rIn the country near D---- a man lived quite alone.\rThis man, we will state at once, was a former member of the Convention. His name was G----\rMember of the Convention, G---- was mentioned with a sort of horror in the little world of D---- A member of the Convention--can you imagine such a thing?\rThat existed from the time when people called each other thou, and when they said \"citizen.\"\rThis man was almost a monster.\rHe had not voted for the death of the king, but almost.\rHe was a quasi-regicide. He had been a terrible man. How did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a provost's court, on the return of the legitimate princes? They need not have cut off his head, if you please; clemency must be exercised, agreed; but a good banishment for life.\rAn example, in short, etc.\rBesides, he was an atheist, like all the rest of those people.\rGossip of the geese about the vulture.\rWas G---- a vulture after all?\rYes; if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his.\rAs he had not voted for the death of the king, he had not been included in the decrees of exile, and had been able to remain in France.\rHe dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city, far from any hamlet, far from any road, in some hidden turn of a very wild valley, no one knew exactly where.\rHe had there, it was said, a sort of field, a hole, a lair.\rThere were no neighbors, not even passers-by. Since he had dwelt in that valley, the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass. The locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of a hangman.\rNevertheless, the Bishop meditated on the subject, and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the Convention, and he said, \"There is a soul yonder which is lonely.\"\rAnd he added, deep in his own mind, \"I owe him a visit.\"\rBut, let us avow it, this idea, which seemed natural at the first blush, appeared to him after a moment's reflection, as strange, impossible, and almost repulsive.\rFor, at bottom, he shared the general impression, and the old member of the Convention inspired him, without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself, with that sentiment which borders on hate, and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement.\rStill, should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil? No. But what a sheep!\rThe good Bishop was perplexed.\rSometimes he set out in that direction; then he returned.\rFinally, the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd, who served the member of the Convention in his hovel, had come in quest of a doctor; that the old wretch was dying, that paralysis was gaining on him, and that he would not live over night.--\"Thank God!\" some added.\rThe Bishop took his staff, put on his cloak, on account of his too threadbare cassock, as we have mentioned, and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon, and set out.\rThe sun was setting, and had almost touched the horizon when the Bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot.\rWith a certain beating of the heart, he recognized the fact that he was near the lair. He strode over a ditch, leaped a hedge, made his way through a fence of dead boughs, entered a neglected paddock, took a few steps with a good deal of boldness, and suddenly, at the extremity of the waste land, and behind lofty brambles, he caught sight of the cavern.\rIt was a very low hut, poor, small, and clean, with a vine nailed against the outside.\rNear the door, in an old wheel-chair, the arm-chair of the peasants, there was a white-haired man, smiling at the sun.\rNear the seated man stood a young boy, the shepherd lad. He was offering the old man a jar of milk.\rWhile the Bishop was watching him, the old man spoke:\r\"Thank you,\" he said, \"I need nothing.\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639645739, "end": 1639904939, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639904961, "snapshot": "1639645739", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9e63B2e309599814f3A97BAB0a5624bf32e82D55", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
