Myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied the see of D---- As has been seen, he called it regulating his household expenses.\rThis arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by Mademoiselle Baptistine.\rThis holy woman regarded Monseigneur of D---- as at one and the same time her brother and her bishop, her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the Church. She simply loved and venerated him.\rWhen he spoke, she bowed; when he acted, she yielded her adherence.\rTheir only servant, Madame Magloire, grumbled a little.\rIt will be observed that Monsieur the Bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres, which, added to the pension of Mademoiselle Baptistine, made fifteen hundred francs a year.\rOn these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted.\rAnd when a village curate came to D----, the Bishop still found means to entertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, and to the intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine.\rOne day, after he had been in D---- about three months, the Bishop said:--\r\"And still I am quite cramped with it all!\"\r\"I should think so!\" exclaimed Madame Magloire.\r\"Monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town, and for his journeys about the diocese.\rIt was customary for bishops in former days.\"\r\"Hold!\" cried the Bishop, \"you are quite right, Madame Magloire.\"\rAnd he made his demand.\rSome time afterwards the General Council took this demand under consideration, and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs, under this heading:\rAllowance to M. the Bishop for expenses of carriage, expenses of posting, and expenses of pastoral visits.\rThis provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senator of the Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundred which favored the 18 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of D----, wrote to M. Bigot de Preameneu, the minister of public worship, a very angry and confidential note on the subject, from which we extract these authentic lines:--\r \"Expenses of carriage?\rWhat can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants?\rExpenses of journeys?\rWhat is the use of these trips, in the first place?\rBut what a disgrace to be ignorant!\rDo like the people of Queyras!\"\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469363, "end": 1639728563, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [1, 0], "scores_total": 1, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728582, "snapshot": "1639469363", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9C08a426c5bF675415DBabB45A55ab4c1973afB8", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x29feb22708e8f33dc08e8d36e752949e44675534f37cd73b743792775a2fe376", "voter": "0x97432c12ea8C957C3aE2d59c9953CF8dF9CBc5b0", "created": 1639489955, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alexec.eth"}}]}
