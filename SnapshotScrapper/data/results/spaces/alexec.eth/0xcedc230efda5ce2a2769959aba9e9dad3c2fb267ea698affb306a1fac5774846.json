The bookcase was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books; the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble, and habitually without fire. In the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron, ornamented above with two garlanded vases, and flutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf, which was a sort of episcopal luxury; above the chimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper, with the silver worn off, fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen; near the glass door a large table with an inkstand, loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes; before the table an arm-chair of straw; in front of the bed a prie-Dieu, borrowed from the oratory.\rTwo portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of the bed.\rSmall gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented, one the Abbe of Chaliot, bishop of Saint Claude; the other, the Abbe Tourteau, vicar-general of Agde, abbe of Grand-Champ, order of Citeaux, diocese of Chartres.\rWhen the Bishop succeeded to this apartment, after the hospital patients, he had found these portraits there, and had left them.\rThey were priests, and probably donors--two reasons for respecting them.\rAll that he knew about these two persons was, that they had been appointed by the king, the one to his bishopric, the other to his benefice, on the same day, the 27th of April, 1785.\rMadame Magloire having taken the pictures down to dust, the Bishop had discovered these particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper, yellowed by time, and attached to the back of the portrait of the Abbe of Grand-Champ with four wafers.\rAt his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff, which finally became so old, that, in order to avoid the expense of a new one, Madame Magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it.\rThis seam took the form of a cross. The Bishop often called attention to it:\r\"How delightful that is!\" he said.\rAll the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals.\rHowever, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over, paintings, ornamenting the apartment of Mademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall see further on. Before becoming a hospital, this house had been the ancient parliament house of the Bourgeois.\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639469399, "end": 1639728599, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [1, 0], "scores_total": 1, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639728612, "snapshot": "1639469399", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7197883B74bb9fF27c7c301057139a698C3aAB0f", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xb0709f35a0cb125aae2ba09f53dc5dcdb86a2779f6c725be381106bc175382ea", "voter": "0x97432c12ea8C957C3aE2d59c9953CF8dF9CBc5b0", "created": 1639489640, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alexec.eth"}}]}
