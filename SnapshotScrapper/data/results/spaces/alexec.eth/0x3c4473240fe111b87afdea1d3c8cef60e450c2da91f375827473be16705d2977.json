I did not think that I had the right to kill a man; but I felt it my duty to exterminate evil.\rI voted the end of the tyrant, that is to say, the end of prostitution for woman, the end of slavery for man, the end of night for the child.\rIn voting for the Republic, I voted for that.\rI voted for fraternity, concord, the dawn. I have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and errors.\rThe crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light.\rWe have caused the fall of the old world, and the old world, that vase of miseries, has become, through its upsetting upon the human race, an urn of joy.\"\r\"Mixed joy,\" said the Bishop.\r\"You may say troubled joy, and to-day, after that fatal return of the past, which is called 1814, joy which has disappeared! Alas!\rI have, when the occasion offered, protected my own adversaries, men of your profession.\rAnd there is at Peteghem, in Flanders, at the very spot where the Merovingian kings had their summer palace, a convent of Urbanists, the Abbey of Sainte Claire en Beaulieu, which I saved in 1793.\rI have done my duty according to my powers, and all the good that I was able. After which, I was hunted down, pursued, persecuted, blackened, jeered at, scorned, cursed, proscribed.\rFor many years past, I with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they have the right to despise me; to the poor ignorant masses I present the visage of one damned.\rAnd I accept this isolation of hatred, without hating any one myself.\rNow I am eighty-six years old; I am on the point of death.\rWhat is it that you have come to ask of me?\"\r\"Your blessing,\" said the Bishop.\rAnd he knelt down.\rWhen the Bishop raised his head again, the face of the conventionary had become august.\rHe had just expired.\rThe Bishop returned home, deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannot be known to us.\rHe passed the whole night in prayer. On the following morning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about member of the Convention G----; he contented himself with pointing heavenward.\rFrom that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers.\rAny allusion to \"that old wretch of a G----\" caused him to fall into a singular preoccupation.\rNo one could say that the passage of that soul before his, and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his, did not count for something in his approach to perfection.\rThis \"pastoral visit\" naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coteries.\r\"Was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop?\rThere was evidently no conversion to be expected. All those revolutionists are backsliders.\rThen why go there? What was there to be seen there?\rHe must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried off by the devil.\"\rOne day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself spiritual, addressed this sally to him, \"Monseigneur, people are inquiring when Your Greatness will receive the red cap!\"--\"Oh! oh! that's a coarse color,\" replied the Bishop. \"It is lucky that those who despise it in a cap revere it in a hat.\"\r\rAlthough Monseigneur Bienvenu was far from being a politician, this is, perhaps, the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the events of that epoch, supposing that Monseigneur Bienvenu ever dreamed of having an attitude.\rLet us, then, go back a few years.\rSome time after the elevation of M. Myriel to the episcopate, the Emperor had made him a baron of the Empire, in company with many other bishops.\rThe arrest of the Pope took place, as every one knows, on the night of the 5th to the 6th of July, 1809; on this occasion, M. Myriel was summoned by Napoleon to the synod of the bishops of France and Italy convened at Paris.\rThis synod was held at Notre-Dame, and assembled for the first time on the 15th of June, 1811, under the presidency of Cardinal Fesch.\rM. Myriel was one of the ninety-five bishops who attended it.\rBut he was present only at one sitting and at three or four private conferences. Bishop of a mountain diocese, living so very close to nature, in rusticity and deprivation, it appeared that he imported among these eminent personages, ideas which altered the temperature of the assembly.\rHe very soon returned to D---- He was interrogated as to this speedy return, and he replied:\r\"I embarrassed them. The outside air penetrated to them through me.\rI produced on them the effect of an open door.\"\rOn another occasion he said, \"What would you have?\rThose gentlemen are princes.\rI am only a poor peasant bishop.\"\rThe fact is that he displeased them.\rAmong other strange things, it is said that he chanced to remark one evening, when he found himself at the house of one of his most notable colleagues:\r\"What beautiful clocks!\rWhat beautiful carpets!\rWhat beautiful liveries! They must be a great trouble.\rI would not have all those superfluities, crying incessantly in my ears:\r`There are people who are hungry! There are people who are cold!\r", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1639645879, "end": 1639905079, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [0, 0], "scores_total": 0, "scores_state": "pending", "scores_updated": 1639905111, "snapshot": "1639645879", "state": "closed", "author": "0x22Cb8e1E8352CFC14eF7Fdb88C9c1C54a92d602c", "space": {"id": "alexec.eth", "name": "AlexDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
