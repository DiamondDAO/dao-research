Initial proposals do not go into detail on how their goals will be achieved so I propose we standardise and use this format for proposals.\n\nMotivation:\n\nI would like to know what I'm voting for and how it will be implemented, how will do it and how it will be managed so that I can vote with confidence that it's the right thing to do for dots.\n\nImplementation:\n\nAll proposals follow this format of Summary, Motivation, Implementation, Test Cases and Measuring Success. If the proposal passes then future proposals should follow this format (or an iterative version of this voted for by future proposals). To allow users to highlight they are not following the format, abstain should also be added as an option to any vote.\n\nProposals should run for 7-14 days to give everyone a chance to vote for them.\n\nCost: 0\u039e\n\nTest cases:\n\nThis is a non technical proposal, if passed then votes can decide to vote negatively based on not having enough information.\n\nMeasuring Success:\n\nSuccess of this proposal will be felt through the success of future proposals raised.", "choices": ["Agree", "Disagree", "Abstain"], "start": 1637308800, "end": 1638518400, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [14, 0, 0], "scores_total": 14, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638518418, "snapshot": "13644276", "state": "closed", "author": "0x65dd41e5B528aCcf1d456e0c3147bf171AB3B63f", "space": {"id": "dotdotdao.eth", "name": "dotdotdao"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xb184660bcb2b5b8fe5741d39a86712a13d3ec82cb4d48bb55b0f6e88f125e8f3", "voter": "0xC04208F289D3842Ac168f2C373b3164E1d872650", "created": 1637611069, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dotdotdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xbd56db29c17c4ebbf6e7a63d1df26c5f4614e51d05f1e9edf6dad1e252acdfc1", "voter": "0x820Adbe5bBaBa72979949686E3d32f784542235D", "created": 1637487712, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dotdotdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x56cc9499a805b6e723be08e4d62469a745414ff3f3bffeb838d51b95ca05ba30", "voter": "0x6b711E387693CDeD325c5A0C334594060034a1a8", "created": 1637346525, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dotdotdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xf6267b0ac763a326ab7e6a515d5e3fa294dbb676e34f5ed1287bc35e46bdacbe", "voter": "0x9C19c2B6c9435588485990711Ec50178985aF3B6", "created": 1637344510, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dotdotdao.eth"}}]}
