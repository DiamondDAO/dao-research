In the spirit of \"Occam's\" strategy envisioned in [the latest accepted proposal](https://medium.com/graviton-one/occams-proposal-for-graviton-ec2ebec575eb), we aim to keep the governance proposals simple and modular. Please have a look at the first proposed changes/actions to be undertaken below.\n \n### Part 1: Vote duration\nIn order for decision-making to take effect as fast as possible, the team of Graviton proposes to set up a fast Snapshot voting cycle of *48 hours*. \n\n### Part 2: Liquidity management initial steps\n[The Occam\u2019s proposal](https://forum.graviton.one/t/occam-s-proposal-for-graviton/353/3) was accepted with the decision to convert 80% of the Treasury deposits into native assets and other \u201cblue chip\u201d tokens on a range of blockchains where GTON is present. To conduct the very first step in this process, the Graviton team proposes to start with *converting 80% of the stablecoins in the Treasury into ETH on the Ethereum blockchain*. Afterwards, we aim to swap and wrap that ETH further in order to set up liquidity on multiple chains with a variety of native assets and \"blue chip\" tokens. \n\nPlease discuss on Graviton forum: https://forum.graviton.one/t/gravitons-first-snapshot-proposal-fast-voting-cycle-first-steps-in-liquidity-management/356", "choices": ["Accept both Parts", "Accept Part 1, Reject Part 2", "Reject Part 1, Accept Part 2", " Reject both Parts"], "start": 1635955200, "end": 1636128000, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [281.98062544207676, 15.82582958036492, 0, 0], "scores_total": 297.8064550224417, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1636760156, "snapshot": "13544478", "state": "closed", "author": "0xCed486E3905F8FE1E8aF5d1791F5E7Ad7915f01a", "space": {"id": "gton.eth", "name": "Graviton"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x188223532ed9b37b11929d722cd18476a21ff516a76b813452668a743a1cd6f4", "voter": "0xC7453c11e58E80B78909EE550065C97046d1674A", "created": 1636040144, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "gton.eth"}}, {"id": "0x59fecf4b539ada50007c986a74206e49148abe107cc18b4c7d4393554402631f", "voter": "0xE90C77C885cB57b2e8Fc7c99f2b2ec751Ed938B6", "created": 1636038796, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "gton.eth"}}, {"id": "0x5900f036a15694c1fc2092ed71457241325cb44ba2c96e75744fb033f232e7f3", "voter": "0x5a1247933878eA4ad47092Ab19FD90666140700f", "created": 1635959440, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "gton.eth"}}, {"id": "0x3c42cfdb2d7b9b683976d3b988d03df25516e67b01e1b8c1a8a28a9bb4e42615", "voter": "0xEDa38655a88bcD58b2Da7a4fFA702Fb3c725C4CE", "created": 1635955663, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "gton.eth"}}]}
