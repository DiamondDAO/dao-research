The goal of YIP-02 is to leverage YIN Finance platform to showcase Shadow Labs strategy capability in DEXs with AMM mechanism. In return, subscribers will benefit from the high yield from CHI strategy without manual operation and avoid paying high transaction fee multiple times as he/she adjusts the price range in Uniswap V3.\n\nProposed CHI Strategies\nAt the beginning, CHI strategies consisted of high volatility token pair WETH/USDC and low volatility pairs such as USDC / USDT, DAI / USDC, RAI / DAI and FEI / USDC. When dealing with high volatility token pairs in the likes of WETH/USDC, users will be presented with options in two fee tiers: 0.05% and 0.3%.\n\nIn the case of supplying liquidity for WETH / USDC token pairs, it is recommended to choose 0.3% fee tier when the trading volume is active and fluctuating, and choose 0.05% when the range is barely fluctuating.\n\nFor more details on the strategy, please visit our article on Deep Dive into the Analysis of Strategy Performances Based on Volatility Characteristics. https://medium.com/@ShadowLabsorg/deep-dive-into-the-analysis-of-strategy-performances-based-on-volatility-characteristics-452515f2fa98\n\n.\n\nAbout Shadow Labs\nShadow Labs is a premium research institution responsible for the research and development of active liquidity strategies for DEXs with AMM mechanisms including but not limited to Uniswap V3.
