Ownership of the .eth registrar gives the DAO the ability to:\n\nAdd and remove controller contracts.\nSet the resolver contract for .eth\nWe propose that ownership of the \u2018.reverse\u2019 namespace, which governs assignment of primary ENS records, be transferred to the DAO. Ownership of the .reverse TLD gives the DAO the ability to:\n\nReplace the reverse registrar for Ethereum addresses.\nCreate new types of reverse resolution (For example, bitcoin addresses) and update them.\nImportantly, control over the ENS root will remain with the ENS root multisig for now. Control over the root allows for the creation and replacement of ENS top-level domains (TLDs) other than .eth (.eth is locked and cannot be changed by the root). This proposal also does not transfer ownership of the DNSSEC registrar contract, necessary for administering the DNSSEC integration used to allow owners of DNS domains to claim them on ENS.\n\nPowers over the ENS root are not being requested immediately, as they are both powers that can be abused to revoke or reassign non-.eth ENS names, and as such the risk to name owners is significantly higher than the other powers the DAO will exercise. Once the DAO has demonstrated its ability to sucsessfully govern ENS, a future proposal will transfer these powers to the DAO.\n\nSnapshot voting on the above proposals will be conducted individually via approval voting; any proposal above that gets at least 50% approval and a quorum of 1% becomes the official policy of the DAO.\n\nSpecification\nThe ENS DAO formally petitions the ENS root keyholders (being the owners of the multisig located at multisig.ens.eth) to execute a transaction or transactions taking the following actions:\n\nIf proposal 1 passes, transfer all ETH and USDC held by multisig.ens.eth to the DAO\u2019s timelock contract at wallet.ensdao.eth.\nIf proposal 2 passes, call transferOwnership on the contracts at controller.ens.eth and 0xb9d374d0fe3d8341155663fae31b7beae0ae233a (the price oracle), passing in the address of wallet.ensdao.eth.\nIf proposal 3 passes, call transferOwnership on the contract at registrar.ens.eth, passing in the address of wallet.ensdao.eth.\nIf proposal 4 passes, call setSubnodeOwner on the root, passing in keccak256(\u2018reverse\u2019) and the address of wallet.ensdao.eth.\nThe ENS DAO agrees to use these funds and powers in accordance with the ENS Constitution.\n\nConclusion & Next Steps\nThis proposal looks to set precedent as the first action taken by ENS delegates & token holders. Upon successful execution, the ENS DAO will hold control over two significant aspects of the protocol, and will be able to dispense funds effectively towards community initiatives.\n\nDiscuss this proposal on the ENS forum and discord.\nImplement a vote on this proposal on Snapshot.\nIf passed:\nTransfer existing assets from the ENS Community multisig to the ENS DAO.\nTransfer control over the Registrar Controller to the ENS DAO.\nThis vote is being conducted via approval voting; select each option you wish to see pass. Those options that have at least 50% support and 1% quorum when voting ends will pass", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1637683200, "end": 1638158400, "type": "single-choice", "scores": [3.6197437836961415, 5.889957084248194], "scores_total": 9.509700867944336, "scores_state": "final", "scores_updated": 1638158423, "snapshot": "13677142", "state": "closed", "author": "0xA8b6B922c5AdF5075deb403415527850e7806849", "space": {"id": "metabtc.eth", "name": "metameta"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x60a68f44a9fab3b28ae1a5cb198f94b89ffa4b0ce659a7112b8cff34ca05ec2e", "voter": "0xA8b6B922c5AdF5075deb403415527850e7806849", "created": 1637756318, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "metabtc.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb87634b8a7abc18c0776c6d7ace6455398f0531fe5aa60b836503a5db8e7959e", "voter": "0xc77b7F0736dFF353f0ab63CBc861818c4Ea8423D", "created": 1637756306, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "metabtc.eth"}}, {"id": "0x5873d82a9a66f295a2626b41d8fddcc56e1fb940dde1039ecd3b83ba548ecd2a", "voter": "0x87F0c1994D33B87f80F74a7E760086a6B0C8dceF", "created": 1637756280, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "metabtc.eth"}}, {"id": "0xeced0bc8c8d55bb6163493da26cf1f9b3b52fcc7a9cbd7260b6d0a02084e9c1d", "voter": "0x289Fe3ee4fD12A295B95eeA102c1F2C1f5c62f95", "created": 1637756269, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "metabtc.eth"}}, {"id": "0x468cd77228ac1737560d0ed9b0bdf655aa269a9d981f515b39bb585b7368863e", "voter": "0x620B609a2CEe06D7Dd4fFCcf7c2Cd4C48D3Fd8c9", "created": 1637756260, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "metabtc.eth"}}, {"id": "0xd1a687fe7f824113c4c978ba4bc4a7bbe398c38a637be636e8f4495935e5901e", "voter": "0x2a9838c62fc7C00B19b44963ca46E0164D937E56", "created": 1637756251, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "metabtc.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1670bf05c69ebf84dfce46aaa677b77513fb592e5a8bf753892da17569420887", "voter": "0x5366949A2dC804dA72E7e2Bb9104FeB37bFDaAeE", "created": 1637756219, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "metabtc.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0496b11c12e3993c87fa0dfe6d832d05760c4180cfeabb2071e1fef0487e9f9a", "voter": "0x491E35208026cd736B5e19b086efdae526EFBc33", "created": 1637756209, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "metabtc.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0da1e4a2894505e4828463d8010eb1821baa363a254e9833910d4759978b936f", "voter": "0x2604ff3E75ac2D8409B29c21EA7cf3A763deb474", "created": 1637756199, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "metabtc.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc4a167ae12a02ea97a0581f1ad4ba0452d3d1a16636b73e567b2d5d7d53ed5e4", "voter": "0x3C6788be1c8C23F6C8229de295Dff3785e85b348", "created": 1637756190, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "metabtc.eth"}}, {"id": "0x56379add609904cde8c91bd6cd0fbdb3a56f4eedfaacaca3cff40392ac7ed04c", "voter": "0x7020B5882692965567eE7aa09da086b31839ce84", "created": 1637756161, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "metabtc.eth"}}]}
