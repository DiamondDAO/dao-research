", "body": "Hello everyone, \nI want to propose migrating some of the treasury funds to Polygon for the follwing reasons:\n\n1.   To set up a LP on Polygon\n2.  To buy some $Blok.\n3.  To fund the Polygon staking contract (this gets decided in a \n    seperate [Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/metagamehub.eth/proposal/0x7608cedf0b3028e4f95e40eccec10fbb56971fc81bae74254d103f8ef8231540)\n\nReasoning: \n-----\n1.  Cheap trading for everyone. People who just want to invest small amounts to be part of the community can now do so. Get exposure from Polygon Ecosystem\n\n2. Bloktopia is a promosing project that is already established, but still has a lot of potential for growth, so the allocation in $BLOK could pay.\nWe would be positioned well to buy Bloktopia lands as soon as the opportunity arises.\n\nSpecifications: \n___\n1.  We set up a Pool with 300k liquidity on 1.12.  and migrate USDC and MGH accordingly.\n\n2.
