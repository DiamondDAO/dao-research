Please review and vote on the mission statement. If you vote \u201cNo\u201d, please provide a comment. Yam\u2019s mission statement summarizes the purpose that drives the Yam DAO community. It says why Yam does what it does. When Yam considers new opportunities, it relies on the mission to make appropriate decisions.\n# Motivation\nBrands are tools that drive value: it was this premise that motivated Yam contributors to invest time developing the Yam brand. Branding is a long-term strategy that can yield measurable returns throughout the life of Yam as it grows and morphs.\n### Here are Three reasons to invest time and energy developing the Yam brand.\n#### 1. Attract Customers, Yam Members, and Ecosystem Partners\nBy clearly defining audience personas and crafting marketing messaging that\u2019s specifically targeted at your ideal target audiences. Significantly improve relationships with those that interact with Yam\u2019s brand. And few things are more valuable than brand loyalty.\n#### 2. Boost Value of Organization\nNever underestimate the power of brand equity. it can have a positive effect on your YAM token price. Stronger brands realize stronger financial performance. The long-term result of branding is that the Yam DAO itself is worth more.\n#### 3. Increase Marketing Effectiveness\nWhen your brand is cohesive and well-articulated, your marketing initiatives will be too. Branding encompasses the essential \u201cfirst steps\u201d that define Yam\u2019s core messaging, brand personality, and marketplace position. A set of guidelines and templates that come out of branding will save Yam time, money, and frustration when developing future initiatives.\n# Specifications\nAt the core of the Yam brand is the mission statement which is presented below in both a short-form and a long-form.\n# Yam\u2019s Mission Statement - short-form\nYam is a collaborative community innovating at the intersection of decentralized governance and programmable finance. Our open, fair and ethical philosophy fosters an inclusive and energetic culture. We are a fair-launch DAO pushing the bounds of innovation and launching experiments to enable the very promise of what DeFi can become for the world: a global, permissionless financial ecosystem.\n________________________________________\n# Yam\u2019s Mission Statement - Long-form\nYam is a community run Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) innovating at the intersection of decentralized governance and programmable finance, bound by shared financial incentives with the goal of empowering people with greater economic benefits and financial well being within the emerging world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Yam mission and vision is supported via three guiding pillars.\n#### Fair and Ethical Distribution\nBy the community, for the community. We are an ultra-committed community of doers embracing an open, fair and ethical philosophy. The Yam community fosters an inclusive, energetic and collaborative culture committed to building valuable products and infrastructure that benefit the Yam community.\n#### Decentralized On-Chain Governance and Treasury\nYam is committed to decentralized protocol ownership, leveraging its powerful and forward-looking community to both build and guide the protocol forward. The community decides together how best to invest the treasury and grow the protocol which can only be performed with approval from YAM holders\u2019 on-chain votes.\n#### Innovation: Unique economics with cutting edge experimentation\nYam seeks to enable the very promise of what DeFi can become for the world: a global, permissionless financial ecosystem. Think of Yam as an idea factory dedicated to creating new innovations and launching experiments. Yam is therefore in uncharted waters, full of unknowns and possibilities, and we like it here. In the midst of these unknowns and possibilities, Yam\u2019s mission serves as its north star.\n#### How Yam is different\nWhile other DeFi ecosystem players subscribe to similar goals, many make various trade-offs for efficiency, security, or profit in place of decentralization and community ownership. These tradeoffs can sometimes be rationalized, but Yam will refuse to stray from our core values, and instead drive confidently forward together with our community.\n# Poll to Measure Sentiment\nVote Yes: ratifies the Yam Mission Statement\nVote No: rejects the mission statement\n", "choices": ["Ratify the Yam Mission Statement", "Rejects the mission statement"], "start": 1607292000, "end":
