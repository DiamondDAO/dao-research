They were never promised compensation but they volunteered for several month because they believed in Yam\u2019s mission: \n \nYam is a community run Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) innovating at the intersection of decentralized governance and programmable finance, bound by shared financial incentives with the goal of empowering people with greater economic benefits and financial well being within the emerging world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\n \nAs we progress through the building of Yam\u2019s ecosystem, time requirements and dedication is necessary to build out the current and future products. \n \n### Here are the guidelines for part-time contributors to receive compensation: \n\u2022\tEach contributor has their roles and responsibilities. \n\u2022\tPart-time commitment is ~10hrs of documentable work a week. \n\u2022\tMonthly contributor reports. \n\u2022\tQuarterly reviews. \n\u2022\tWeekly discussions and or calls\n\u2022\tContributors will control their own time, if there are any issues with the weekly requirements, they are flexible. \n \n### Contributor Core Values\n\u2022\tOpen and Merit Based Discussion: Contributors should organize information to be presented to the community in an open and unbiased manner. The discussion and consideration of ideas should be based on the merits of those ideas. If you disagree with an idea or solution, describe why and how you would remedy it. \n\u2022\tSupport Ethical Growth: Contributors should be committed to growing the the long term value of the YAM DAO and the YAM token and to strengthening the community of token holders and contributors.\n \n### Compensation:\n![foo](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/yam1/original/1X/4c38a97a70d0156353d4d43dab1fea2509b7f3e3.png)\n \n### A short intro/bio from each of the part-time contributors:\n \nKW710 | Kristopher is the founder and owner of a commercial production and animation studio based in Los Angeles with clients ranging from startups to Fortune 500 brands.
