It can be done by denominating in the ratio of 1:10\n\nExample, the total supply can be reduced 10 times, and each of them holding the token will be reduced 10 times but the value will be the same. If I have 10 tokens worth $10, I can have the same value with 1 token.\n\nIn this way, it will meet more demand, supporting the protocol as whole. We have a huge community and as investors we would like to see YamV2 gaining value upon adoption.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1598263200, "end": 1598529600, "snapshot": "1122335", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6E1368C42c9cB0a51A55228BF2de2c4738e83A60", "space": {"id": "yam.eth", "name": "Yam Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
