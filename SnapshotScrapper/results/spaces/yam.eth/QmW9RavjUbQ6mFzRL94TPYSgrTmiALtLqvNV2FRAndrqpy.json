YAM first come to my attention after the price crash due to bugs in a smart contract. I have been closely following YAM development including the V2 migration and this latest governance proposal.\n\nIn order for YAM to move forward, a good YIP(YAM Improvement Proposal) system is urgently needed. While I see most of the new proposal here in one or another way asking for support for their proposal on governance system and etc... I strongly believe that the first and most important thing to do now is \"TO ESTABLISH A YIP SYSTEM BEFORE MOVING FORWARD TO ANY OTHER PROPOSAL\".\n\nAfter some discussion I come to the following proposal :\n\n1) We Urgently Need To Establish A YIP System Before Proposing Any New Proposal\n\nThe main reason behind this is that the YIP system serve as a backbone for any new proposal before they can be agreed and implemented by the community.  Without a YIP system anyone can suggest a new proposal and things will become complicated fast before any solution can be found. As a proof of my point there are around 40 new proposals which is to many for the community to digest at the time of my writing.\n\n2) Any New Proposal Must Obtain Simple % of Vote Before Becoming Official Suggested Proposal\n\n3) Official Suggested Proposal Must Obtain Certain % of Vote And Cannot Exceed Certain % of Rejection Before Qualified As An Official Proposal\n\nThe 2 tiers system that I proposal above should be able to eliminate the weak proposal and allow majority community members to focus their precious time on studying only on the official suggested proposal (rather than all new proposals) before they vote to accept or reject a proposal.\n\nAs you can see I did not list specific % of vote require in 2) and 3) above, this is because I strongly believe that the community should be allowed to decide this after this proposal had been accepted.\n\nLastly, please give me your support and vote to make YAM a better system. Thank you.", "choices": ["Yes, Establish YIP Sytem", "No, YIP System Is Not Needed"], "start": 1598184000, "end": 1598702400, "snapshot": "10727899", "state": "closed", "author": "0xF354800587aA33CCC37De4225Abc4a9c221c5F1B", "space": {"id": "yam.eth", "name": "Yam Finance"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNwhptAday6BxYUDo7CkoU3UuCepotrb4JDLWzkKg7n7A", "voter": "0xe105766f0156DAec8a46E407E35634542fA012E6", "created": 1598580830, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWSDRj9AMpQzCqzW7AwEusa1aGLRJfuMFBUSZ5aFwnfPb", "voter": "0xF3a61fdE0675480be93dB9e026E06687DF01c66c", "created": 1598572551, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeUS7LxDtecKcVXLKhohFgHNF47dkTWLK7iJJZsZG6Eiu", "voter": "0xD3802dcE7F7A54d59E7a64329d287624FF3F495a", "created": 1598506613, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPU4gySpy6cq2YFpfvAPbYwwk5KQQe2a6nviwRDbNQz14", "voter": "0xd8655066Cd6d6757dd227D43BB12d8E0d9d36B7f", "created": 1598503893, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP566bepDkmy3ggBYbzo6DTgck5ZqkWBPA4zerhBJpSet", "voter": "0xEC3281124d4c2FCA8A88e3076C1E7749CfEcb7F2", "created": 1598495342, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmegEGctcTFUbWPoFWeWgPeGEi74VeFsnCDcBEBi4unKcD", "voter": "0xc2B17B9931C4d9A81089D1f045F1F00CAdba2c61", "created": 1598494342, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbBbZhS4NzmEKr9jUFPnExDhJi3L61Zq3fkisAvq7gRPR", "voter": "0xF354800587aA33CCC37De4225Abc4a9c221c5F1B", "created": 1598336155, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}]}
