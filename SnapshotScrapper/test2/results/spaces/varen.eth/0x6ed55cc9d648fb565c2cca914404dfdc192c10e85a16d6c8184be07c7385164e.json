This will continue the charitable path that the Varen community has so far established in regards to old YFL holders.\n\nMotivation:\nThe remaining YFL were taken from the yYFL gov staking vault by a malicious actor, and as a result some yYFL holders (called \u2018victims\u2019 in this prop) couldn\u2019t withdraw the YFL they were expecting to be able to withdraw from the gov staking vault.\n\nNot appealing to any responsibility on part of the current VRN project or team, but only appealing to the pity and graciousness of the VRN community, this proposal seeks to make the victims who came forward whole.\n\nSpecification:\nThis proposal concerns the effected stakers of the yYFL vault exploit. The process for reimbursement will be based on the following terms and conditions:\n\nyYFL stakers must have been staked 90 days prior to the exploit to qualify.\nThe window to claim will last 2 weeks from a date announced in the event this prop is successful.\nThe reimbursement will be at a ratio of 1 VRN to 1 yYFL in accordance with the migration. (assuming the cap isn\u2019t hit).\nIn leiu of a required staking period the reimbursement will be sent out 90 days after the 2 week claim period ends.\nThe reimbursement fund will be capped at 100 VRN. If more than 100 yYFL are claimed for reimbursement the ratio will be determined by the 100 VRN : # yYFL Claimed. If there are fewer than 100 yYFL presented for claim the remaining VRN will be returned to the Varen Treasury.\nRequired information for a claim will be announced if the prop is passed.", "choices": ["Approve Proposal", "Reject Proposal"], "start": 1636084800, "end": 1636347600, "snapshot": "13553260", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6736755f862F3bD899021D8994a43a7F646FEb17", "space": {"id": "varen.eth", "name": "Varen"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xcee96a518edaf5aecb5f819597621331ca75773038c836de9b7683bb4f716470", "voter": "0x9bf1872Ec7fDC896279369A8F3eaD3a3bc4969fd", "created": 1636336280, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "varen.eth"}}, {"id": "0x82de6a60efa509790e8f4527446cdc7468379bcecf8f2521b916b0122edb6cbb", "voter": "0x777F2B01F3c6C4F641Ac399211Ef1541650C2F07", "created": 1636245073, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "varen.eth"}}, {"id": "0x2081421f5d0ddbabaf5524a467fbd1d2786d203b8bd3032abd4c726eb1a0f357", "voter": "0x33Dd38f962499335Da451b91E46bD3db94FFebc9", "created": 1636135233, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "varen.eth"}}, {"id": "0x52db7f2ab7ef8a4d54fd5afc50c76c42ff5ac7f2e28110f676bb0b92e46674da", "voter": "0x568087B744EfB54E2C779dA8e612c553e62Bb200", "created": 1636129295, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "varen.eth"}}, {"id": "0x9e9052f97e8180c53df38569c94db50b6d3b2a53e3b24baea53102e4e9f06ee3", "voter": "0x963E464c78d5d2A16a2563a96Fe85C637F9D1c41", "created": 1636127758, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "varen.eth"}}, {"id": "0x960066695de5fcb381175aafbeed22b1711a5c62f4b1fd8834e505c15db61f7d", "voter": "0x6Ed85492DfD36253e7831867F76DD2779c79f83D", "created": 1636114675, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "varen.eth"}}, {"id": "0x35e4b6c608c47234764b2657e98815bd97642a098bd601afbc17b5d355ae2294", "voter": "0x5300E07a01f6CBf9c6538022E74381EE41A3b977", "created": 1636096292, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "varen.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc2d4264308a4957d75097b28b8e403a7fce614e07e039655ddd0bc355db07e49", "voter": "0x6cbA451057A3F90F0e75EEB9fcd9Ab5d86bAf5F6", "created": 1636096146, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "varen.eth"}}, {"id": "0xf42d1c9004ca1aa39d5fd10cef1d5239670a6bd73b340a3404c4d940415a2147", "voter": "0x2FF6b9feE37c8Cdf537166e0d19B9E2221F13A2B", "created": 1636096053, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "varen.eth"}}]}
