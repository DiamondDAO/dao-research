So here's the proposal on how we plan to use ALCH in the treasury to fund a large bootstrap pool, how we plan to allow people to lock ALCH to gain a stake and make a DAO which showcases Alchemy\n\nNFTs Swap for ALCH Application\nNFT owners will be able to apply to the DAO to trade their NFT for ALCH, which will then be locked into an Alchemy DAO, users will be able to keep a small amount from the NFT DAO tokens as a bonus for providing high quality NFTs for sale to the DAO\n\nDAO Allocation to Bootstrappening\nCommit 1,500,000 ALCH to a smart contract controlled by ALCH which allows for people to place an NFT into the contract with a proposal price to allow for trading. If the ALCH DAO vote to purchase the NFT for the listed price, the token will be swapped for ALCH from the DAO.\n\nALCH holders will then be able to lock ALCH to earn the new NFT token. There will also be a .2x allocation which will be sent to the ALCH DAO for future value appreciation and use\n\nThis proposal will allow Alchemy to finally have a high value NFT DAO and showcase the infrastructure attracting more users and hopefully bootstrapping the systems actual use\n", "choices": ["Approve 1.5m ALCH", "Lower Allocation but Approve", "Do not Approve"], "start": 1626400800, "end": 1626602400, "snapshot": "12838577", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9D31e30003f253563Ff108BC60B16Fdf2c93abb5", "space": {"id": "alch.eth", "name": "Alchemy DAO Snapshot"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRjSEE7AcwgZkpcWyFzXQab9F9FdQqXRW36Lyu5yGhXEQ", "voter": "0xe6Bb6432650d78bF1CD02d36762A28379b623F4E", "created": 1626568232, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alch.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUJUhe9vy5DA2aKjPGpk8WvM6z6iPemtUQvovtmpmCyDE", "voter": "0x4f99dc8966ABc905F207Ef17B2319f629c452Ec1", "created": 1626529543, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alch.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaWh54tL8GJixGHj61UTQpdHSbiWPDfhHkDxFAcvcDaWE", "voter": "0xBAfe6495E9BCBB78F3534a60980c3AaDbA74157B", "created": 1626525742, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alch.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeVNG3HHKj6FmmdV14TcAKZwyqMHJDBAAUM1vFP2pjxDr", "voter": "0xa35dEa1466b6cf14a1ac1A1203578908399e560f", "created": 1626521873, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alch.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSKH9YPoC54VkyGBjwS74RmLUC5frS9PQzGjAeWKsLK6a", "voter": "0x114fd56Dde7b28D04f78fC07DCf0fE862372FEdd", "created": 1626479833, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alch.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTAu3u73f2s7Z1LREaMK62Xtd2Kr73Q2NH3qroU72Wmpq", "voter": "0xC29fC038Cd055842d466281F609C319Bde595017", "created": 1626479318, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alch.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY848Kf3yTXAKgGtcbADegJBVPggAHojVsVDv5MX1jdGi", "voter": "0xE1C49BEca9cf0489426F53e914F1D98987866Ee1", "created": 1626457107, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alch.eth"}}]}
