Someone could use multiple wallets to stake from which makes it unfair for community members who are not able to be available at the time the staking begins.\n\nMy proposal is the following :\n\nWe use the staking funds from the buyback-tokens to create a Pool with all buyback -Try coins in it.\n\nWe create a second pool where the community can stake their Try.\nEveryday through a one year period the pool releases 1/365 of its funds to the stakers.\nDevided evenly to all staking participants.\n\n(additionally it would be possible to reward long term stakers a bit more then short term stakers. Maybe every month one person stakes the system adds a \"figurative\" +10%, then next month 9%, then next month 8% in a cummulative way on top of it to reward long term stakers even more. How exactly this would work we can discuss in another proposal. But I think this could be upgraded once the basic system runs)\n\nSolution's advantages:\nIn this way we eliminate the human factor out of the staking.\nSo there can not be delays and people can just join the pool at any time.\nAnd once the system is up it takes a lot less Team-resources then the manual staking.\nAlso anybody willing to join the staking can do so at any time.\nAnother point is that people who want to stake do not need to worry and give their funds out of hands, if done correctly.
