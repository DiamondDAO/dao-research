I have been a long time fan of the project due to their amazing team, product and partnerships. In this article we will be learning about the different staking methods that have been demonstrated in the economic whitepaper and summarize if it is profitable to stake with Trias. \n\nThe world of blockchain is changing at a rapid rate. In the past few years we have seen numerous blockchain projects come into existence with promises to solve real world issues. Today, the promises made by these projects exist only on the whitepaper. To fund the development activities, these projects sell tokens that would allow participants/buyers to use their services in the future(We call these utility tokens). A major issue is that these tokens are useless until the mainnet is released and applications are built. Inshort the buyers have to hold these tokens until products/applications/services are available by that project that could take years giving rise to the speculative features. \n\n\nTrias is a full-stack decentralized trusted cloud infrastructure and an enterprise-grade blockchain. It is built to solve the \u2018trusted issues\u2019 and to ensure that systems respond to the way they are designed. In its three layers ( Leviatom, Prometh, and MagCarta), it integrated TEE(trusted execution environment) technology, cyber security, graph computing algorithms, etc. as a combined blockchain solutions to ensure the nodes are executed, software is developed and applications are operated without deliberate tampering and unintentional misconduct. Trias is building a highly scalable public chain that provides \u201clayer -1\u201d infrastructure to support other public chains that include but not limited to Ethereum and Hyperledger. Meanwhile, it has already developed its DApp, TriasForce, a DSaaS(Decentralized Software as a service), which has received great response from the enterprise world. The project has had multiple sales for TriasForce from enterprises and has been well appreciated.\n\nWhy DSaaS?\n\nThe decentralized applications are termed as the future... Applications solving issues such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), data processing, supply chain management etc... could be life savers and could save millions of dollars to businesses using them. The applications built on blockchain would be cheaper and hold higher security standards than the traditional centralized applications. These applications could build the bridge between traditional businesses and blockchain companies.\n\nTrias blockchain has built its own DSaaS(Decentralized software as a service) application. It has three products namely, TriasForce-Security, TriasForce-Audit and TriasForce-ERP. TriasForce is currently deployed at many enterprises and has received great response. More importantly, the sales of TriasForce is linked to its parallel staking models that will have a huge impact on the value and utility of TRY token.\n\nTrias has been consistently innovating not only in technology but also in the token economy. While other projects only describe the possible usage of its token and seldom consider economic growth and inflation rate, Trias has been designing economic models for its 3 layers. Particularly, in its MagCarta Layer, the version 2.0 Economic paper was recently published. It came up with two parallel staking models:\nFranchise-Franchisee model &\nThe Staking Auction model\n\nAs more detailed explanations are in the paper itself, some highlights are listed here:\n1. Franchise-Franchisee model: This is a staking system for business activities that take place on the Trias ecosystem. To grow the DSaaS ecosystem, good products and an extensive sales network are needed to sell the products. When organizations/individual developers that are developing applications on MagCarta, traditional software distributors and service providers can join to grow the distribution channel. In this economy, product developers are \u2018franchisors\u2019 and sellers are \u2018franchisees\u2019. To make a franchise agreement between the two, and franchisees need to stake tokens as an upfront \u2018investment\u2019.\n\nIn this model proposed by Trias, the stake holders are paid from the revenues generated by the DSaas or other applications that will use the Trias infrastructure.\n\nIn general/regular staking models, the holders are paid by means of inflation. These models inflate/mint new tokens and distribute them to the stakers but in case of Trias, no new tokens are minted. The model buys tokens from the market and distributes to their token stakers. The revenues generated in real time(Fiat/Crypto) will be used to buy back the tokens from the market. In case the rewards are not distributed to the stakers, the tokens will be burned and permanently removed from the circulating supply.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of this model is that the franchisors who stake their tokens as an upfront investment on the platform are not rewarded but will have to stake tokens. This generates a regular market demand for the TRY token as the number of franchisors/products on the platform increase. This model will ensure the growth and sustainability of the token economy.\n\n2. Staking Auction model: This is the staking system for individual token investors as it allocates values generated from the business activities in the Franchise model to the individual token holders. The purchase of tokens occurs when:\nThere is revenue generated from the sale of DSaas and by use of Trias ecosystem tools.\nBusiness partners/alliance/franchisor/franchisee join Trias to stake.\n\nUnlike the traditional staking model that rewards through inflation, this is a Non-inflationary approach as no new tokens are minted. More importantly, the paper also illustrates a burning mechanism to remove the tokens bought through buyback from the economy by burning, further decreasing the total circulation.\n\nHow profitable is the staking model?\n\nTrias has released its first staking auction that starts on May 1st 2020. A highly profitable staking auction model that could give returns in the range of 90% till upto 1200% APR.\n\nTrias will have different rules for every staking auction. The rules will be announced before each staking auction model. To learn more about the staking auction, please read the official notification here:https://staking.trias.one/\n\nOverall Verdict: The Staking model is innovative and revolutionary. A top project that could provide returns in the range of 90%-1200% are very rare. More importantly: No loss!\n\nThe staking auction will have high anticipation from the community considering that the project has great trading volume. The Non-inflationary approach to reward the stakers and token burn is amazing. If a realistic sales model is considered, this staking model could generate some amazing returns over the next few years. The project is heavily under-valued and is working on building enterprise applications and adoption.\n\nTherefore, I solemnly request that the Trias lossless Staking Auction should be restarted:", "choices": ["Support", "Not support", "Don't care"], "start": 1606708800, "end": 1609387200, "snapshot": "11358659", "state": "closed", "author": "0xD971Ff2F067B1f73a70a7372bF8055a4e578BC83", "space": {"id": "trias", "name": "Trias"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmc2kA9zxJJt1emv35nbEch28EjKHfgVkcUQJ1hPcGDMUt", "voter": "0x3Af14FfAF8d41951f75c415325f342d0A75d6F3d", "created": 1607495705, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "trias"}}, {"id": "QmekQkC9vNbHc5nEAXLthHtbMX2dRWxiNTn8rbjUqq9JE2", "voter": "0x39D8f8c96664835590A90a2Aa8c9a64D49f89259", "created": 1606810009, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "trias"}}, {"id": "QmUKDnUiwY1VAx5D2rYvhk8TXNzdoVweVpuQzRrNnLeHwM", "voter": "0xD971Ff2F067B1f73a70a7372bF8055a4e578BC83", "created": 1606720507, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "trias"}}]}
