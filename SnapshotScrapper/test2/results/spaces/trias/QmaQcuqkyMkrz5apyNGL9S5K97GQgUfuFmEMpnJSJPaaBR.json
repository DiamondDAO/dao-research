Definitions of franchisors and franchisees in the context of blockchain development businesses are:\n\nFranchisors: Organizational and individual developers can utilize Trias infrastructure of chains and smart contracts to develop chains and DApps. Thus, a franchisor can be 1) a public blockchain; 2) a protocol/toolkit affiliated to Trias ecosystem; 3) an enterprise blockchain product/solution.\n\nFranchisees: Local franchisees have special terms with franchisors on the right to sell products and services to enterprise clients in a region. A typical franchisee can be a distributor of software products with established channel and client resources.\n\nBoth franchisors and franchisees can generate their own native tokens, use Trias tokens, or still use fiat money.\n\nThe network helps to create real value for all participants. The model incentivizes the development and upgrade of a product from a franchisor because it attracts the sellers (franchisees) and later aligns with interests of the franchisees of the product by ensuring them to stake tokens. The number of tokens staked is based on the number of products that can be sold. \n\nTherefore, the better the infrastructure and the products, the more trade surplus could be generated, which creates a natural selection of good products. Meanwhile, the upfront stake brings more experienced franchisees, which is a natural selection of distribution channels. The more the products are developed and sold, the larger the economy grows, so will the utility and value of the tokens.\n\n\nWho can be Trias Franchisees?\n1.
