Project winners of the competition will have the opportunity to obtain the grant as their angel investment.\n\nAs Trias Grant platform keeps growing and maturing, it will committ itself to creating a decentralized, transparent, fair and efficient grant mechanism, empowering new projects and fostering fast growth of the entire industry. \n\n\nThe Operation Mechanism of Trais Grant \n--Staking TRIAS to get the initial project tokens\n\nAt present, the committee of Trias Hackathon Competition selects quality projects to endow them the grant opportunities. Projects that pass the committee's evaluation will receive initial TRIAS provided by Trias Fund.\n\nTo participate in the grant requires to stake a certain amount of TRIAS tokens. When the project fulfills its funding target, participants will get the initial project token of the same value. TRIAS staked will be burnt when the initial token is issued and distributed.\n\nIf the project fails to reach the target, then the grant fails. Participants will not be able to obtain the the initial project token. But as a compensation, Trias project will return Trias tokens to users along with a revenue based on an average yielding rate (APR: 8%). \n\n\nFund a grant\n-First of all, you should have TRIAS token in your wallet. You can buy them in exchanges (e.g., Kucoin, Uniswap, Pancake, etc.);\n-Choose the projects you support and stake TRIAS, starting to participate in the grant;\n-Wait for the grant ends;\n-If the grant is successful, you will receive the new token issued by the project within a specific time;\n-If the grant fails, you will get the TRIAS tokens staked along with 8% APR revenues.\n\nStart a grant\n-Participate in the Trias Hackathon Competition, and get the recommendation of the expert jury team to earn the Trias Grant opportunities;\n-Launch on the Trias Grant platform, and set target grant amount and period;\n-At the end of grant, if the amount received exceeds the target, you can obtain the angel investment, that is, TRIAS raised from this Grant. After issuing new tokens, you will distribute them to the corresponding funding participants.\n-At the end of grant, if the grant amount goes under the aim, it means that the grant fails. The project cannot obtain the angel investment or technical support from Trias team.\n\n", "choices": ["support", "no idea"], "start": 1618315200, "end": 1619236800, "snapshot": "7000000", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB3573bFc071d09b5E6Dd5812D2ED42D69F7e5971", "space": {"id": "trias", "name": "Trias"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
