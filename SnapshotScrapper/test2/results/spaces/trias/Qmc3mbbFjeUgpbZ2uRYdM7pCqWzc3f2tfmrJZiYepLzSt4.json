The oligarchy of DeFi has always been Ethereum, but with the rapid growth of traffic, the problems of Ethereum network congestion and high cost begin to appear. For retail investors, a transaction of tens of dollars is really a not low threshold. \n\nBSC is a public chain that optimizes the problems of Ethereum first. Users of the centralized exchange start to drain to the field of DeFi through BSC. At the beginning of this year, a wave of DeFi market belonging to BSC was launched.\n\nI propose Trias to launch on BSC to reduce the cost of transactions and increase the applications of Trias token(TRIAS).\n", "choices": ["support", "no idea"], "start": 1616493600, "end": 1618891200, "snapshot": "10000000", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB3573bFc071d09b5E6Dd5812D2ED42D69F7e5971", "space": {"id": "trias", "name": "Trias"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
