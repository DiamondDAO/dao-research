This creates a perverse incentive that could worsen price discount and weaken price peg.\n\nThe team now proposes Responsive Restorative Rebase as an improvement. If this STP is passed, Restorative Rebase will take effect, and all outgoing transfers (other than those whitelisted) of the relevant \u03c4Asset must pay a Restorative Contribution, as soon as the TWAP of the \u03c4Asset drops below 1.0. Restorative Rebase will remain in effect until the TWAP of the \u03c4Asset restores to 1.0. Other details of STP 8 remain unchanged.", "choices": ["Pass", "Deny"], "start": 1621692000, "end": 1621951200, "snapshot": "7635170", "state": "closed", "author": "0x19E7Aa69a8e3A53aA2EC37037B497089F7D78815", "space": {"id": "1btc.eth", "name": "BTCST"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
