If STP 8 is passed, Restorative Rebase will be activated for \u03c4Bitcoin on or by April 30, 2021 at 08:00pm (SGT).\n\n# Details\n\nAs \u03c4Bitcoin continues its initial liquidity event, it has demonstrated strong price resilience and earned tremendous market recognition. No deflationary rebase has been triggered because of the built-in open market purchases and our community\u2019s trust in \u03c4Bitcoin\u2019s price pegging mechanism. This shows that \u03c4Bitcoin, supported by miners representing 12% of Bitcoin\u2019s global hashrate, is the most successful synthetic Bitcoin on the market.\n\nThe team has since received advice from experts in algorithmic assets and our community on how \u03c4Bitcoin\u2019s deflationary rebase process could be improved. Namely, the current deflationary rebase process described by the \u03c4 whitepaper proportionately reduces the balances of all \u03c4Bitcoin addresses during a deflationary epoch. This process could discourage some market participants from holding \u03c4Bitcoin, for the universal rebase could be viewed as unfairly punishing faithful owners not responsible for price deviation.\n\nThe team now proposes Restorative Rebase as an improvement. Restorative Rebase intends to (i) not only protect but also reward faithful holders of \u03c4Bitcoins during deflationary epochs, (ii) discourage, with high precision, behaviors that aggravate price discount, and (iii) create a stronger force to restore the relative price of \u03c4Bitcoin compared to Bitcoin back to 1.\n\nRestorative Rebase consists of the following components:\n\n* **Restorative Contribution:** During an epoch (each epoch is about 24 hours) where \u03c4Bitcoin TWAP is below 0.9 (relative to Bitcoin) such that deflation becomes necessary, all outgoing transfers of \u03c4Bitcoins from any addresses (other than addresses whitelisted for being exchange consolidation wallets or \u03c4Bitcoin re-investment vaults, etc.) must pay a Restorative Contribution in an amount equal to 30% of the transferred amount. For example, a user must hold 1.3 \u03c4Bitcoin in a sender address in order to successfully initiate a transfer-out with a specified amount of 1.0 \u03c4Bitcoin. The Restorative Contribution is not deducted from the amount that a recipient will receive; rather, the transfer will fail if the sender address does not contain sufficient \u03c4Bitcoin to cover the contribution. When the transfer goes through, the sender address will be deducted 1.3 \u03c4Bitcoin, and the recipient will receive 1.0 \u03c4Bitcoin.\n\n* **Restorative Burn:** Of the collected Restorative Contributions, 50% (15% of the transfer amount) will be burned immediately to permanently take them out of circulation. Again, unlike the current deflationary rebase process, Restorative Burn is transfer specific and does not impact holders of \u03c4Bitcoins who have no outgoing transfers of \u03c4Bitcoins during deflationary epochs.\n\n* **Ecosystem Rewards:** The remaining 50% (15% of the transfer amount) of the collected Restorative Contributions will be allocated to be mined by the BTCST-\u03c4Bitcoin vault over a period of 5 epochs, with 10% released during each epoch. Note that only addresses that have no outgoing transfers of \u03c4Bitcoin during an epoch is eligible to mine this allocation of \u03c4Bitcoin rewards.\n\nThe process for \u03c4Bitcoin\u2019s inflationary rebase (e.g., bringing the relative price of \u03c4Bitcoin compared to Bitcoin down to 1) remains unchanged.", "choices": ["Pass", "Deny"], "start": 1619103600, "end": 1619438400, "snapshot": "6752971", "state": "closed", "author": "0x0377e60e3149AF4A37559294aF63Bca17e3E1586", "space": {"id": "1btc.eth", "name": "BTCST"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
