If this STP 9 is passed, synthetic mining of \u03c4Doge by BTCST stakers and airdrops for other ecosystem participants will commence via BTCST\u2019s dApp on Friday, May 14, 2021 at 08:00pm (SGT).\n\n# Details\n\nWith the implementation of STP 8 \u2014 Restorative Rebase and its demonstrably strong price history (i.e., with a stable price premium at 5\u20136%), \u03c4Bitcoin has established itself as the most successful synthetic Bitcoin in DeFi.\n\nNow, BTCST is ready to unveil its second synthetic asset, \u03c4Doge, that users can stake BTCST and \u03c4Bitcoin to synthetically mine.\n* See the \u03c4 protocol whitepaper for more details on the mechanism of \u03c4Assets.\n* See STP 8 for details on Restorative Rebase, which substantially enhanced the price pegs of all current and future \u03c4Assets.\n\nTotal initial liquidity of \u03c4Doge is proposed to be set at 150,000,000.\n\nHere are launch parameters of \u03c4Doge initial liquidity event proposed; all time intervals are approximated by block accounts:\n\n* Earned by staking BTCSTs: 75,000,000 (50.00%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly (determined by block counts).\n* Earned by staking \u03c4Bitcoin: 750,000 (0.50%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly.\n* Earned by staking BEP-20 Doge (i.e., Binance Smart Chain version of Dogecoin): 750,000 (0.50%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly.\n* Earned by staking \u03c4Doge: 4,500,000(3.00%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly.\n* BTCST will create four new vaults: BTCST-\u03c4Doge, \u03c4Bitcoin-\u03c4Doge, Dogecoin-\u03c4Doge, \u03c4Doge-\u03c4Doge to allow for the synthetic mining of \u03c4Doge proposed above.\n\nHere are airdrop parameters of \u03c4Bitcoin proposed; all time intervals are approximated by block accounts:\n\n* One-time airdrop to PancakeSwap Syrup Pool: 1,500,000 (1.00%); distributed following Syrup Pool rules; users may visit PancakeSwap\u2019s syrup pool to claim syrup pool airdrops.\n* Airdropped to PancakeSwap \u03c4Bitcoin-BTCB Liquidity Providers: 1,500,000 (1.00%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly; to be eligible for a week\u2019s \u03c4Bitcoin-BTCB LP airdrop, a user must be a \u03c4Bitcoin-BTCB LP on PancakeSwap for the preceding week and maintained at least USD 1000 in \u03c4Bitcoin-BTCB liquidity; the amount of \u03c4Doge airdrops that a user is eligible to receive is proportional to the user\u2019s average balance of \u03c4Bitcoin-BTCB LP Tokens for the preceding week.\n* Airdropped to BTCST holders: 600,000 (4.00%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly; to be eligible for a week\u2019s BTCST Holder airdrop, a user must hold BTCST in a personal wallet (exchange accounts and other similar custodian accounts are ineligible for the airdrops) for the preceding week and maintained at least USD 1000 of average BTCST balance; the amount of BTCST Holder airdrops that a user is eligible to receive is proportional to the user\u2019s average balance of BTCSTs for the preceding week.\n* Same with \u03c4Bitcoin, \u03c4Doge is available in the Airdrop page of our dApp.\n\n\u03c4Asset treasury will reserve 60,000,000 (40%) of \u03c4Doge\u2019s initial liquidity for community grants and other ecosystem building purposes.", "choices": ["Pass", "Deny"], "start": 1620223200, "end": 1620820800, "snapshot": "7159399", "state": "closed", "author": "0x19E7Aa69a8e3A53aA2EC37037B497089F7D78815", "space": {"id": "1btc.eth", "name": "BTCST"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
