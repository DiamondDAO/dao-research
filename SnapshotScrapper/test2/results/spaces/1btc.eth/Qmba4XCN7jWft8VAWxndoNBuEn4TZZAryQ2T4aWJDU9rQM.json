If STP 7 passes, \u03c4Sage will be launched via BTCST dApp v2 by the end of May 2021.\n\n# Details\n\nBTCST has implemented \u03c4 protocol to empower users to mine \u03c4Bitcoin, our first synthetic asset. While the BTCST team and our miners and mining pool partners work towards further implementation of \u03c4 protocol to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs), we observe that the current NFT mint schemes are in need of authority oracles.\n\nSpecifically, we observe that the sole and ultimate source of truth for NFT authority records, which are data establishing the link between minted tokens and assets these tokens purport to inextricably represent, are stored solely in the NFT issuance contracts. NFT holders therefore must trust that the private key holders with admin access to these contract data would not irresponsibly or recklessly temper with these records. In other words, data immutability isn\u2019t sufficiently improved or foolproof by the use of NFT technologies in most cases.\n\nBTCST proposes \u03c4Sage to solve this issue. \u03c4Sage is an authority oracle for NFT. Available for integration by any platform intending to mint NFTs, \u03c4Sage rolls up and preserve authority records of minted NFTs in the coinbase text of Bitcoin and other temper-resistant public ledgers. \u03c4Sage will also offer NFT holders simple ways to (i) trace the authority records of their tokens down to the specific blocks of Bitcoin and other temper-resistant public ledgers and (ii) export the reports to provide cryptographical proofs of digital ownership to third parties.\n\nHere is how \u03c4Sage works:\n\n* To gain access, an NFT mint contract intending to issue tokens verifiable through \u03c4Sage must first maintain a certain amount of BTCSTs as collateral for data accuracy.\n\n* The NFT mint contract will pass all authority records as they are created to the \u03c4Sage network. \u03c4Sage will perform authority validation and periodic rollups on these records to reduce them into a form suitable for coinbase text preservation. The \u03c4Sage decentralized network is consisted of miners with sufficient mining power to decide coinbase text. These miners must also post BTCST collateral as surety.\n\n* Periodically, the \u03c4Sage network will insert rolled up authority records as coinbase text of Bitcoin and other temper-resistant networks. Raw records will also be preserved by the \u03c4Sage contract for verification purposes.\n\n* Holders of NFTs issued with \u03c4Sage integration can then utilize \u03c4Sage to instantly verify the full authority chain of their tokens and explicitly identify and demonstrate with a high degree of confidence where and how the authority records of their NFTs are stored, with convincing details including the block IDs of Bitcoin and other temper-resistant public ledgers.", "choices": ["Pass", "Deny"], "start": 1617710400, "end": 1618315200, "snapshot": "6329782", "state": "closed", "author": "0x19E7Aa69a8e3A53aA2EC37037B497089F7D78815", "space": {"id": "1btc.eth", "name": "BTCST"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
