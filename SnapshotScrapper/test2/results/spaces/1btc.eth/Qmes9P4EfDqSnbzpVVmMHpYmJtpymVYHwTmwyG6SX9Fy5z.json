If this STP 6 is passed, synthetic mining of \u03c4Bitcoin by BTCST stakers and airdrops for other ecosystem participants will commence via BTCST\u2019s dApp on March 26, 2021 at 08:00pm (SGT) the earliest.\n\n# Details\nBTCST has implemented \u03c4 protocol to empower users to stake BTCST in return for synthetic assets. The first \u03c4Asset to be synthetically mined by staking BTCST is \u03c4Bitcoin, a synthetic Bitcoin that brings Bitcoin to DeFi. See the \u03c4 protocol *[whitepaper](https://www.btcst.finance/static/BTCST_Whitepaper.pdf)* for more details on the mechanism of \u03c4Assets.\n\n#### Total initial liquidity of \u03c4Bitcoin is proposed to be set at 2,100.\n#### Here are the proposed launch parameters of \u03c4Bitcoin initial liquidity event; all time intervals are approximated by block accounts:\n* Earned by staking BTCSTs: 1,050 (50.00%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly.\n* Earned by staking BTCBs: 21 (1.00%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly.\n* Earned by staking \u03c4Bitcoins: 84 (4%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly.\n* BTCST will launch a new version of its dApp with three new vaults -- BTCST-\u03c4Bitcoin, BTCB-\u03c4Bitcoin, \u03c4Bitcoin-\u03c4Bitcoin to allow for the synthetic mining of \u03c4Bitcoin proposed above.\n\n#### Here are the proposed airdrop parameters of \u03c4Bitcoin; all time intervals are approximated by block accounts:\n* One-time airdrop to PancakeSwap Syrup Pool: 10.5 (0.5%); distributed following Syrup Pool rules; users may visit PancakeSwap\u2019s syrup pool to claim syrup pool airdrops.\n* Airdropped to PancakeSwap BTCST-BNB Liquidity Providers: 10.5 (0.5%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly; to be eligible for a week\u2019s BTCST-BNB LP airdrop, a user must be a BTCST-BNB LP on PancakeSwap for the preceding week and maintained at least USD 1000 in BTCST-BNB liquidity; the amount of tBitcoin airdrops that a user is eligible to receive is proportional to the user\u2019s average balance of BTCST-BNB LP Tokens for the preceding week.\n* Airdropped to BTCST holders: 84 (4%); distributed over 8 weeks; rewards halve weekly; to be eligible for a week\u2019s BTCST Holder airdrop, a user must hold BTCST in a personal wallet (exchange accounts and other similar custodian accounts are ineligible for the airdrops) for the preceding week and maintained at least USD 1000 of average BTCST balance; the amount of BTCST Holder airdrops that a user is eligible to receive is proportional to the user\u2019s average balance of BTCSTs for the preceding week.\n* BTCST\u2019s new version of dApp will feature an Airdrop page to allow users to connect their wallets to view and claim BTCST-BNB and BTCST Holder airdrops.\n#### \u03c4Asset treasury will reserve 840 (40%) of \u03c4Bitcoin\u2019s initial liquidity for community grants and other ecosystem building purposes.\n\n\n", "choices": ["Pass", "Deny"], "start": 1616472000, "end": 1616724000, "snapshot": "5921859", "state": "closed", "author": "0x19E7Aa69a8e3A53aA2EC37037B497089F7D78815", "space": {"id": "1btc.eth", "name": "BTCST"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
