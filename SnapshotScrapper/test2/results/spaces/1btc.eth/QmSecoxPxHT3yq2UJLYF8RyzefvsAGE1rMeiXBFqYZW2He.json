In this proposed new dApp, staking BTCSTs will still mine BTC the same way (and at the same rate and Boost Factor) as the current dApp.\n\nThe difference is that before mining rewards distribution, BTC mining rewards will be converted to BTCSTs at market price at that time (we will bear the exchange trading fees). This market price will be published in daily reports and will be auditable through exchange trading records. Final rewards will then be distributed in the form of BTCSTs to the new dApp. This new dApp will also allow a staking holder to harvest mined BTCSTs and re-stake them with one-click.\n\n# Why:\n\nStaking holders who wish to reinvest mining rewards in BTC to BTCST can save significant fees and time when reinvesting.\n\nDaily automatic reinvestment will help support BTCST market price.", "choices": ["Pass", "Deny"], "start": 1612238400, "end": 1612526400, "snapshot": "4521587", "state": "closed", "author": "0x19E7Aa69a8e3A53aA2EC37037B497089F7D78815", "space": {"id": "1btc.eth", "name": "BTCST"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
