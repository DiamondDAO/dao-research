That is why we have decided to modify the protocol so that everybody whose proposal gets adopted could receive a reward.\n\nWe are going to allocate 10 million WSE from the treasury to the Governance Reward contract. This sum was committed as a fund, which will be further replenished. At the moment, once somebody\u2019s proposal is approved, they will be rewarded with 100,000 WSE. However, the reward size can be changed in the future as well.\n\nDo you agree with that proposal?\n\n", "choices": ["Yes, I agree", "No, I don't"], "start": 1616083200, "end": 1616688000, "snapshot": "12063064", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9112F50B39Fb3556F40d737d0C65e60088D78d13", "space": {"id": "wse.eth", "name": "WhiteSwap"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmaUabqY4mmquUVfLjKPzsjUkzYneRTf6j5zreynTFmG2z", "voter": "0x95Db09ff2644eca19cB4b99318483254BFD52dAe", "created": 1616577773, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "wse.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQpH56kuuTjjPU79jEXJ5vUUkvz6oHUxavtn2akfi1b6y", "voter": "0x812ed6324e2c18a2328aB18B564cbc8b081F577e", "created": 1616159414, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "wse.eth"}}]}
