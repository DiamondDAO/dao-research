Arbitrage trading is not bad thing but if it happens too often, then it should be changed. So it seems that current ZUSD redeem fee is too low, so I think the fee should be at least 0.5%. So I propose to update ZUSD redeem fee from 0.02% to 0.5%~1.0% and then the ZETA holders too can have benefits from this.", "choices": ["0.5%", "0.6%", "0.7%", "0.8%", "0.9%", "1%", "0.02% (no update)"], "start": 1604998800, "end": 1605171600, "snapshot": "11228783", "state": "closed", "author": "0x531146f30Be47bB171Cb2039c25a4Ae5D4FE164E", "space": {"id": "zeta", "name": "ZETA"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNtpFmxx1pz2cekWKfm9W5S2My8YaRFggrhfq2gTpDaiZ", "voter": "0x2aA33413Eaa4D1F43A78C36C8D00f6977bb06051", "created": 1605100366, "choice": 7, "space": {"id": "zeta"}}, {"id": "QmU6dSAR6PRVLdTZoPYwUoyH8ahwXWZMR5TFYSpKRvDuc5", "voter": "0xF04A43ee858aA98C502Ebab172939c7024280503", "created": 1605050498, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zeta"}}, {"id": "Qmd7ALoFLKyuuGk37DGL5utj1V5LjnxhSk9vFg2kAUPN4R", "voter": "0x44D1eFe1Ad9e38fCc58e715F2b5fF598D1620C4e", "created": 1605004529, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zeta"}}, {"id": "QmeJenmfY5QUpKegxjDMNd14dWtw4af2eRt4YFAW1y2mRJ", "voter": "0x531146f30Be47bB171Cb2039c25a4Ae5D4FE164E", "created": 1604998992, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zeta"}}]}
