Arbitrage trading is not bad thing but if it happens too often, then it should be changed. So it seems that current ZUSD redeem fee is too low, so I think the fee should be at least 0.5%. So I propose to update ZUSD redeem fee from 0.02% to 0.5%~1.0% and then the ZETA holders too can have benefits from this.", "choices": ["0.5%", "0.6%", "0.7%", "0.8%", "0.9%", "1.0%", "0.02% (No update)"], "start": 1604998800, "end": 1605106800, "snapshot": "11228763", "state": "closed", "author": "0x17142514BBb117aa14B80e081eC4423770cCB464", "space": {"id": "zeta", "name": "ZETA"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
