{"id": "QmQZEPBtSWT9GaKkK2CJ5ZWPxna5nfFGskCE7DVu1xANEZ", "title": "Retire Bad Pools + integrate with DRC", "body": "So, dracula protocol is a new token that has been attacking other farm tokens. It encourages its members to stake the victims tokens with dracula protocol, and then farm the tokens. The protocol sells all of its rewards for DRC, and then market buys its own tokens. For a normal token without token burns, this is very bad. For nice... we have a 20% burn. This is just extra publicity. DRC has tons of publicity (much of it negative) and they have a large advertising warchest, and are doing an airdrop to all uni holders. If we integrated with DRC, we would get tons of publicity indirectly, and we would be one of the top paying APY tokens on their protocol. Top paying apy=more investors =higher nice prices=bigger moons. \n\nThat said, we have quite a few pools that are draining us. \nCompound Escape. Depaaved conduct. Links to Russia. Republic treason. All of these are pools that were important for the initial farming of nice, but now they are a drag on our apy. The people in these pools only contribute to putting downward sell pressure on nice. I don't include the rot pools, because rot is a friendly project. \nI propose the APY for leeching pools be reduced to 0, leaching pools be moved to an \"old pools\" section of website, and these new pools be added:\n1. DRC+NICE->NICE (same rate as Unicorn Poaching)\n2.DRC+ROT->NICE (same rate as copyrot)\n\nUltimately, your answer should come down to whether you personally trust nice, or if you think it is not a good store of value when compared to one of the other token pairs. I think nice is a better token than COMP, REN, or SRM. All those other tokens have shit tokenomics compared to nice. And I think that we should trust nice to moon.", "choices": ["Yes - Nice is worth trusting as a store of value", "NO - I don't trust nice with my money."], "start": 1604077200, "end": 1605117600, "snapshot": "11159640", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7Fb7e28B8bbbA6A0C28c8Ac6a522C2FEFe44ee96", "space": {"id": "nice", "name": "NICEE"}, "votes": 17, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWbidW9kLrYZmKbefDQLpBDSrwy1orq1XnZXn7F2zNPx7", "voter": "0xD38C7588381EA699108564355b7E82AB0C91880C", "created": 1605047853, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmPjMjmT9tPC6j58hxnhuUKpbtHu5dZbQB9AKVtrCh1m15", "voter": "0xd342240C555a864CB4366031dDC6C285e3298443", "created": 1605033421, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmQuvrA51dpJAS9mCieY9t8GDcGTrPeVoXaXPT9G7XKCHz", "voter": "0x0e2481cdC9fFD4DA1EE17b3060D41c7A0a4906B7", "created": 1605005635, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmXxjxdRjW3R2PhsJeUh7L6qx2H79P6FKcqzj17inHWHbs", "voter": "0x616C259b5fD4C3ce12199c260220c80B38897d30", "created": 1604858487, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmTrJVtkHB8r8qXgPN2jrmSkEJsmdEBPfLBp2xwShQp4vR", "voter": "0xFaf6FD225Bd8a9c2e1bA3871Dff6A41B11f2a79f", "created": 1604754417, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmPen4GA8bHstZM1yKjCN4ZZ8EvSAyR3nciGHqUqTh4EYt", "voter": "0xDeb44e56d04EF2aeb82AfA177E7E85a373413C6d", "created": 1604690171, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmRB5CqHZjrsahbrAKLV5mpFQNmiZaiGrLZiZcPvNVNjfF", "voter": "0xDAb0689198149FE688361Ac5Bb4f64587dE7d7b6", "created": 1604572683, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmaBsTQWbYBMMDRkWZw4NWHdPGWDwtmE2zbGBijUYqJ26o", "voter": "0xC6Be36e90aA068526680f4E9C1e4F639cf0f5C51", "created": 1604557087, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmQ5QG6UsVT4C9xHZrb7mjLT9uMxfxyGCPhCzPCQ2wKSoH", "voter": "0x9976BeA85fC4a3Bd2deF075Be7b637E2A1BFb427", "created": 1604510457, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmerGYMfEtNHwnyGtyLHVMR3U6c2QujjN2jP8EWkpfzkaG", "voter": "0xC1684452B9e03e97134A6FAB92D708f10A8752ee", "created": 1604369629, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmWfEtYuQoBK7yXwxHZkWhnwGSYXoGpmY4GNuoeEpL76yT", "voter": "0xcb590fcbcf15a24CFce94f058aE0B0b814bdACce", "created": 1604354828, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmVdtkDdy2MHvVdguQkLTLzZBBjtLLZQrwtpCehFiC9dtQ", "voter": "0x76A8d26B61495A4a8f60E08bE83912194a820A5C", "created": 1604350880, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmTxqKk1o4WaTLj9THmynUfmAcc7JDrwXLacaxvtudqCqT", "voter": "0x8818C2E04A1Fab81cE6432f98a4674971280753F", "created": 1604346566, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmfW476fPvgDnV1F43yZntZTxD5g734pSHzbDdi6VKiBd7", "voter": "0x1cF0bbc0252e8B443012F7eD098f292da566eda2", "created": 1604344688, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmRBBVjYsmyGM1egTpicmCoSEM2JVMT1DdBve54G1tpC9o", "voter": "0xd98A3954353055ab642c9159C7F3B25dac2Dc29b", "created": 1604248288, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmQhuQ48MpakwVJRKo2hkvx6WxdesNKSMr9KRQv5cGELtJ", "voter": "0xbf8DD3E1F220A13E4D8B12fe5d8b745Df875751a", "created": 1604121212, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}, {"id": "QmaRcJuMCYSNrC3fgfu1APX12463NtYRRpkSeedJJd8p91", "voter": "0x37E04861abc7927A586aee80d13E14f71eb1aae5", "created": 1604082465, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nice"}}]}
