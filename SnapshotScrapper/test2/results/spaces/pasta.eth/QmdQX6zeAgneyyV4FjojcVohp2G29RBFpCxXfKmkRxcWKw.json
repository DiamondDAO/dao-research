However, this still represents less than 15% of the total token supply. \n\nOne potential issue is that regular Uniswap LP fees may not be enough to offset impermanent loss from occasional large changes in the PASTA/ETH price ratio. Adding predictable, long term incentives should help counterbalance this effect and support greater participation.\n\n### Proposal\n\nI propose initiating a new liquidity incentive program, distributing 300,000 PASTA tokens to the Uniswap v2 PASTA/ETH LP over 3 months. Funds would be distributed directly to the Uniswap Pool via a [Pasta Chef](https://github.com/Pasta-DAO/pasta-chef) contract like the first distribution.\n\nThe [PastaDAO multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xB449dfE00aACf406eb442B22745A25430490FE1b/balances) currently holds 1,219,000 PASTA, of which 190,000 have been committed to previously approved expenses but not yet issued (90,000 for development grants, 100,000 to be transferred to the [DAO timelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9bb5a48878baa8bd884ecf6bdbc3812ca2bf9b9f)). So this proposed 300,000 expense would represent roughly 30% of the multisig's remaining funding over the next 3 months. During this time, additional fees from PASTA transfers or sales should partly offset this expenditure.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nIf this proposal is approved by voters, the multisig will fund a liquidity incentive distribution mechanism with 300,000 PASTA from the treasury for a 3 month distribution period. Notice will be given to the community in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XAZMWBTrMH) in advance of when the rewards period begins.\n\n### Proposal Question\n\nDo you approve transferring 300,000 PASTA from the DAO multisig for this 3 month liquidity incentive program?", "choices": ["Yes", "No", "Abstain"], "start": 1622775600, "end": 1623207600, "snapshot": "12565000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x8d07D225a769b7Af3A923481E1FdF49180e6A265", "space": {"id": "pasta.eth", "name": "PastaDAO v0"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUGhyK2kBkgTMwQnTCe8ytGwcdoshjXywqtmgoxJNNek7", "voter": "0xAD549C7fcF1bd3E57BCa464D9Dce0A0D561599D1", "created": 1623130633, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pasta.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX5aTyjP3h6Cya5L5HzoHe8AdgTyVRr87UoWs8g1hKyd6", "voter": "0xF4C81e39D127bab86765075A2d55ffe925882BfA", "created": 1622851066, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pasta.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaYZyLpLZuUq6suHaTEzc3sxzqHWxWYU5pTCUx4256PWa", "voter": "0x522F527eEeBC79743D9FE59f10f1A1C8D7427a9E", "created": 1622817485, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pasta.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXnPjXuQWpDV9hs6sLpR8VDaJ3o6hDAqqL7VKQPthJW6R", "voter": "0xCC333BfF4695a2fFf5B79DBeA9890B7dF5772D53", "created": 1622794702, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pasta.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmcd7coMmvhXmZgjetdXn41H2HdYB6QrdQcWaSsU75TedQ", "voter": "0x5c8f16b3e697d7b89439d11D3D249e23e54d23DF", "created": 1622780335, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pasta.eth"}}]}
