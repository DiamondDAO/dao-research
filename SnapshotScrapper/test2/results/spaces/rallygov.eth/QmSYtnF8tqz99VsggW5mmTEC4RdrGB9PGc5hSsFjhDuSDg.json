Founded in 2010 by Rally community member Dave Young, it currently has 30k creators inside it. Dave is a veteran of the game, cinema tech, social audio, voice tech, and ad tech industries. He built an online web game publishing business serving over 40M users per month.\n\nThe group receives 100+ new member requests every day from all over the world. It consists mainly of Independent Game Developers, with the artists, musicians, promoters, and instructional content creators who create assets, courses, videos, and services for the larger Game Development industry worldwide. \n\nOver the years, members have released hundreds of games on all major platforms, worked on AAA titles and engines (Unity, Unreal, Fortnite) all over the world, and steadily grown in experience.\n\nMoving to Discord, Dave is extremely excited to lead the group in using Creator Coin to facilitate value exchange among its members and leverage the massive experience of its veteran members to infuse value back into the community.\n\nThe group is now organizing teams to create Coin-based games and visual experiences for all Rally Coin Creators to use as perks for their members. Custom/bespoke game creation will also be available.\n\nSocials\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/gamedev\n\nUse Cases\nDistribution - $PLAY coin distribution will be done via recognizing positive peer contribution, rewarding game project members for achieving milestones or innovation, and in general for working on game projects.

Industry will get access to all the expert guidance and project teams.

Players will have access to various games, perks, early beta test opportunities, etc.\n\nTransactions - Access to limited seat speaking events, paying other community members to create assets (art, coding, writing, testing, music, sound effects).
