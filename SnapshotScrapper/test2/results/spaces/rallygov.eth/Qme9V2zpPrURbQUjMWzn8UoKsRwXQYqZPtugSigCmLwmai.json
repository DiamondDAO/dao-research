Carlucci, to the Rally community to grow our creator ecosystem and optimize our engagement strategies. \n\nThis advisory arrangement is to be funded by 1) a $RLY grant from the Advisors and Collaborators pool, and 2) a monthly fee from the Community Treasury.\n\nPurpose\nDanilo has an impressive background having been in a senior community role at YouTube and has an extensive network of partners, creators and influencers that could be interested in joining Rally. As such, I\u2019d like to propose him for a $RLY Grant from the Advisors and Collaborators pool, and engage him from the Community Treasury for strategic marketing consultancy and guidance on all things creator growth.\n\nRally team members will work closely with Danilo to develop KPIs for measuring success of this program over time.  Initial metrics will be focused on # of creators brought on per month (small, medium, large), as well as transaction support volume for onboarded creators.     \n\nWe\u2019re setting a new precedent with this proposal. As Rally grows, it\u2019s in the best interest of the community to identify advisors like Danilo that can bring outsized value to the network in the form of creators that can drive transaction volume. We have received many recommendations to work with Danilo, and believe he would be an extremely valuable resource and a great initial experiment to help scale the network.\n\nSummary\nAdvisory arrangement is as follows:\n \n-41,667 $RLY per month for a period of 12 months from Advisors and Collaborators pool (with ability to terminate)\n-$4.5k/mo strategic consulting services for an initial period of 6 months (paid by Community Treasury) \n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\n\n-Deploy 41,667 $RLY per month of completed service from the Advisors and Collaborators pool to: 0x11346EB995FbF9e0ca61436488B86682818aA893\n-Deploy $4.5k/mo from the Community Treasury for a period of 6 months, starting Monday 11/2 \n\nNOTE: As part of this proposal, Rally will be moving $50k worth of USDC into the treasury to augment the treasury and streamline engaging advisors such as these in the future. \n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1603940400, "end": 1604113200, "snapshot": "11148894", "state": "closed", "author": "0x893D2E776F21143354123241bC1DC237C47BC3fC", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
