As part of the proposal, the Rally team will pre-fund the Community Treasury with $60k, during which time the community will have ample time to start measuring and evaluating these PR activities.\n\nWe strongly believe that strategic communications will drive the success of the overall Rally project, including additional influential creator sign-ups and consumer participation, as well as establishing trust, transparency and affinity with crypto press and thought-leaders. We\u2019d like to propose a recurring grant from the Community Treasury - up to a max of $20k/mo - to retain a PR firm to elevate the Rally Network\u2019s external presence in a few key areas: 1) global content marketing, 2) global media relations, and 3) global events management.\n\nPR firm would be vetted and directly managed by Kurt Patat, former Head of Consumer Communications at YouTube.  Continued services with PR firm subject to evaluation by Rally community per the outlined KPIs in Discourse.\n\nSummary:  \nA Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\n\n- Authorize max monthly payment of $20,000 for an indefinite period subject to continued community approval.\n- Authorize selection of firm and day-to-day management of engagement by Kurt Patat.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1604973600, "end": 1605146400, "snapshot": "11226752", "state": "closed", "author": "0x893D2E776F21143354123241bC1DC237C47BC3fC", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 19, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUtab7siPWtksZ5cyh7PWCdWaE8ttJQ9SMkwrtVgtAUdF", "voter": "0xF627E5F4BAd95a956468d8BB6Ee20b119F992E96", "created": 1605135213, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQJrsrENfzkhFwf4yWE1kgALCzHA5BhZU7MuKHgBcopmg", "voter": "0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2", "created": 1605131744, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZGeo38tj4KY6h7UagAkkWxvyGiQVyqbL3LuLqAReNL4N", "voter": "0x1448D5204084AA2D1e8fAf716B0748E0aD0D7A70", "created": 1605131257, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUELZ3MXvbM3HKRHmziF49BauWUjPEHrti8LTYAwhTm3F", "voter": "0xCfaF59e7661997b6f1c51e673ad6A88374A954a7", "created": 1605131174, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd8TR3xm1b6RrQMQQjLPyBjGeQFa1mXK4Wfq5ijty8xPd", "voter": "0x530cDE165934a0A2Fd5acC716409cdFc311cad85", "created": 1605127399, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ6u92iF8W44oHjDvfGSiQEupU3w3v4pHxZdqehELGpmj", "voter": "0x3f3B4c780dCFC39B24B0d09b1f1f1cF133b733D5", "created": 1605113310, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPrL2KUPhPqqYA51NRKGDP7RBC18L31h9xUR55sG1a3Xc", "voter": "0x744b130afb4E0DFb99868B7A64a1F934b69004C4", "created": 1605052886, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbwUYrQZJLaBv8vVwzHfGLBmwQCfqMPWJDGxtHSsMkhjs", "voter": "0x8a286B1BbFDdf7296c497e99d5900005a09831d2", "created": 1605051610, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT8j3kpFiqx4TAnVCP2CBdNyd1t1yEDBMjoA3tccD1tRC", "voter": "0x36aaf8A503B145F90F71C93F901049359b880Abc", "created": 1604982532, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQPbzgEZ7gnGxWDaqA2KUweGu4FL4gQK6HkMhg5mNam3s", "voter": "0x2602CC3A02e3E5717bE3dE174440E5f3FfB20BD8", "created": 1604982510, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbU8ybMPGi1XDYz97PDRjMqWfsRS5aG16fDgpnv7EK1uV", "voter": "0x4239c1EB665E588737192a08CdF2E50794B2b567", "created": 1604981996, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRSpvDMU7hYUfZhsBC68sixekh59Zze3yHhpj5RABuDbs", "voter": "0x4B433887AaC66bDcE23c04bfcA57E29989A165A5", "created": 1604981932, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSgyWi9rKHNndzqXNzWj6Yx4qyt6mXHktiZzzntz5Ujnm", "voter": "0x6D6215ae48B29E4C06078bA7Dc9658FDB5974F7C", "created": 1604979851, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXnD4CtkLfeEzS5t9bW73wukXyyKT9La6HGw3ShTaHa2s", "voter": "0xE2cC777D59b4D354FF1D55aDd7579726d04430C0", "created": 1604979512, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPCfR3y33fK1oPnwvkUNjFobE1FudZw4pNu38S41MUgKp", "voter": "0x893D2E776F21143354123241bC1DC237C47BC3fC", "created": 1604978002, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme4d7FgDNjEGkos5DGKkq1XuKEkup4HXrxqdbjo24PbkW", "voter": "0xa50b080F064E22b990776c90D004b0aF843a4Cd5", "created": 1604977396, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVZzQDuqebtdgtKfpH4yUUGuc6gXzgFn2kUrQm2BuPMi5", "voter": "0xa23c74B499215A40306A27c0d268FAb18b21d338", "created": 1604976603, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPnq4gTRRzUFDjjHqmwTHA5TUrKvgEkruyFZCVGFGYJSW", "voter": "0x22a614388b89734DF8Bc13F8CDcF6854F2b74526", "created": 1604975947, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmceDWKnd2m64iVFEXGJPiqJmEPGDKH5PVUUmnKaPxj4Eb", "voter": "0xf67e69c363771abF7319c4995aCBC99F90e32D61", "created": 1604973960, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
