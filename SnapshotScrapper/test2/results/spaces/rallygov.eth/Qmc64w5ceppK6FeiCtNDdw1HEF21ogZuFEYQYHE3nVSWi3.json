Following our humble beginnings as a Los Angeles-based local blog and club sub-promotion company, we have since seen our global outreach, industry experience, scope and knowledge expand exponentially with each passing year. \nAs of today, we have organized and promoted over 1,000 events, ranging from festivals and warehouse events, to mega-clubs, intimate lounges and unique outdoor venues. \nAside from producing events, we have helped dozens of music artists, festivals, music labels, pro-audio companies, and consumer-facing businesses reach our target demographic and ultimately \u201cget their word out.\u201d thanks to the digital marketing, social media, and native promotion skills we have honed in through our years of experience in the nightlife and entertainment industry. \nIn May of 2019 we went a step further, launching a fully-fledged techno + house apparel and merchandise Shop by 6AM. \n\nDistribution Plan: \nWe will be using our $RAVE coins as incentives for our most loyal supporters via our events and shop purchases. We plan on running contests to include the $RAVE coin as added incentive as well as include them as part of our special merchandise drops. When events return, we plan to reward attendees as well.\n\nHolding Mechanics: \n$RAVE coin holders will be put on a special list where they get offered exclusive discounts and access to our merch, first-notice of events before they are announced. \nHolding $RAVE coins and showing proof at our future events may grant them discounted entry and merch at the show. \n\nTransactions: \nWe will incentivize our fans to use these $RAVE coins for purchases of merch and event tickets, and are exploring exclusive streaming opportunities for $RAVE.\n\nCommunity Treasury Grant Tier: $1000\n\nA 'yes' will approve this proposal and provide a $1000 gift coin grant\n\nA 'no' will deny this prop\n", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1615269600, "end": 1615442400, "snapshot": "12002469", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5ea400d06Afe7aebae54216aDfD7a4bF5f15F993", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPRjBMc8z5LUPVgWFqAujwxPq58og2j7AxH2eGaeMTf8H", "voter": "0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2", "created": 1615412580, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaU9UUnGViwshDB6vHCSwnkDGbYFhq7vZMi7mgysSseco", "voter": "0x76f387E6cAF280f4bb0bea75a1FF08c871Fc2D1a", "created": 1615399523, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQdNJH8Zmj2frCmZERDuiBoGj7UMVvwnLwuaGGKqwGd7a", "voter": "0xccda0716ec78202812c7F5947e8e801461aC38C4", "created": 1615398469, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcAPSp74f6d4VgtQnDai4LMmoyL2D6t1sz6R6EvZW56vF", "voter": "0x34D6508B607Af072858E64c65cEd6e7993225E32", "created": 1615342258, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW27UuSncZtBKdDpoxNT6F976td3qMT371Nb5LYmDfp7X", "voter": "0x301605C95acbED7A1fD9C2c0DeEe964e2AFBd0C3", "created": 1615338494, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTuYoe1atCgA3Sw5eE2Aa52nJ1P1wLc3TxvigCgivV7s9", "voter": "0xE2cC777D59b4D354FF1D55aDd7579726d04430C0", "created": 1615331500, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXbD2yLqUoJ8j1L4kSb3TYib2CSmTph4RzQmzdp4JDhp8", "voter": "0x3f3B4c780dCFC39B24B0d09b1f1f1cF133b733D5", "created": 1615327272, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdKquSr9BCoWznRqKiPW53QUA3AXsuTaJn87LEV9SzrGN", "voter": "0xF1308ee3dC6fCcabFcb4FEEf685B90DA2f54B8a6", "created": 1615326935, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS2vmL8RUEYhHKBmV5hW54wpDTR6ozXAw6yqcr36BpNnp", "voter": "0xb51b62028bDe4d3a9402bF402d3b7a1eA30c02fe", "created": 1615325488, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbgQsDeUz3puwDYf2eQqUAbXvLnGkgfW7mDEAW77sSg19", "voter": "0x5ea400d06Afe7aebae54216aDfD7a4bF5f15F993", "created": 1615324497, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZfGexbvFPTd3T4a3toepdV3Lcw1QFSFLco7ScSEkJhuv", "voter": "0x61FEf96e49F352fBAC4645B0F5aefC0F40d80695", "created": 1615323128, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZnMCVCQ2pMEyTH357wufRcyXcLAH1uNPBbwB6KFwc2RD", "voter": "0x92b406851390541F445B7C697014133d4B5BfcE3", "created": 1615308862, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
