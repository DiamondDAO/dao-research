(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZub5-c1sl8FzlApp-5MpSw)\n\nThe community ambassador is responsible for recording and editing the video. \n\nEditing includes:\n- Transcription\n- Removing silences/uhhms/fillers (makes videos 20-30% shorter in length)\n- Audio leveling and enhancements (remove background noise, make voices sound better)\n- Provide Final video to the Social Media team for upload to Youtube.\n\nWith the current tools being used (Adobe Premiere Pro), the editing process actually takes more time to edit the video than the length of the video itself... A 30 minute video would take at least an hour for the whole transcribing + editing process. \n\n\nNew tool: Descript (https://www.descript.com/) \n\nDescript has been tested for our needs and was able to reduce the time for editing & transcribing by 70-80%! \n\nIt took all of 5 minutes to transcribe, remove all fillers, and export the video for the most recent governance meeting. \n\n\"I honestly can't believe how much time that saved me relative to what adobe's tools would allow me to do...\" - PhelpsGG, Ambassador\n\n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\n\n- Send $150 in USDC from the treasury to the Community Ambassador (PhelpsGG) to purchase 1 year subscription of Descript Video Editing software.\n- Save 100-200 hours of time over the next year by making video editing 70-80% more efficient.\n- Increase the quality of the recorded meetings. \n", "choices": ["\ud83d\udc4d YES", "\ud83d\udc4e NO"], "start": 1607050800, "end": 1607223600, "snapshot": "11383442", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmbp5YKoQKRTc251r39K2z25tKfCbJTa82y3AyQeH47ipC", "voter": "0xF627E5F4BAd95a956468d8BB6Ee20b119F992E96", "created": 1607153958, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSR9Ruqr5EQHhZnYBHdRVF2jznQuTpnx2D7VxVkMFudew", "voter": "0x744b130afb4E0DFb99868B7A64a1F934b69004C4", "created": 1607102412, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaSHsFYkCVYstwn6xq5yfbJhZya2B4kUq47iHiDEumWm2", "voter": "0x323AFc6d2DbE2Eb0AE71Ed1f87db8956834E861d", "created": 1607102397, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY9YAjJHsBXN6rMEUukboBHPfXJ4s3GdeqnGF2zpWgMZe", "voter": "0x7c5b7c2e572522fbAB5Cee155d4D90a634d2dE1E", "created": 1607053899, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTUZZ85bDwwjJxMomrGTgbHerjo5CMxrEdBBK18LoJp47", "voter": "0x3f3B4c780dCFC39B24B0d09b1f1f1cF133b733D5", "created": 1607053793, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbKqjVhV2oobkA3YUXomnzrAXGvtaFoP8XBbVEjPimHz7", "voter": "0x758FF8BA9B6CF5d4e19114B2956FdF870C46337e", "created": 1607053677, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXsHudqVahwwx4rVKMd3AnCsw1Njev2NrYsK9QDuazc13", "voter": "0xE2cC777D59b4D354FF1D55aDd7579726d04430C0", "created": 1607053636, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPbv3romaPAKEdTj8fVHimwvQriXCuZEW9Rqmy5ZQPGkG", "voter": "0xa23c74B499215A40306A27c0d268FAb18b21d338", "created": 1607053400, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXQJHtGRWUK5rqa6KqAXFQgPfV8296f9EaPKA92HwahWX", "voter": "0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2", "created": 1607050814, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
