Budget is time-and-materials based at 200 $RLY an hour, with the reference amount the anticipated range. Paul anticipates wrapping up the final version in September.\n\nPaul and Kevin started a forum thread here last week that has received positive feedback: https://forum.rally.io/t/proposal-rally-whitepaper/1049\n\nBackground\nThe Rally Network has not had a whitepaper due to the substantial amount of work to launch the network and short staffing of the project at launch. The core team and community on Discord/Discourse regularly are asked for a link to a whitepaper by newcomers to Rally. The core team has always wanted to develop a proper whitepaper, but has lacked the bandwidth and the proper expertise to create a paper we can all be proud of as a community.\n\nThe Rally community is expected to benefit in several ways from this initiative:\n* Crypto community, technologists, analysts, media, potential business partners, developers and of course creators can have a definitive whitepaper to reference\n* The whitepaper will be a living document that can be updated over time as the network evolves\n* Several new projects are underway, and the core team can work with Paul to capture these projects in the whitepaper\n\n\nProposal\nThis proposal will grant Paul 200 $RLY an hour from the Community Treasury to develop the project described above. The anticipated budget will be 30-40K $RLY.\n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would approve the payment of this grant. A No vote would result in rejection of this proposal.", "choices": ["Yes - I support the whitepaper", "No"], "start": 1623697200, "end": 1623870000, "snapshot": "12629162", "state": "closed", "author": "0x36aaf8A503B145F90F71C93F901049359b880Abc", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVGf9tCpA8ipX2QVnjVd3FzZBL4hm4X1NhgKuecm56YFz", "voter": "0x2ede0ccEBFb3bf307DafC57Ff700183391620a69", "created": 1623815312, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmaeq6Hq83CQcnCCsLENWwx3q9j85TaP4wVE95nbnfH6rC", "voter": "0xC5BCC6C6da4996f1351d2F51c9570B5F60821c8F", "created": 1623787066, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYPr5TFdrMF5Sk27fggo9psmECjtggquiEKhBpDwRg6YE", "voter": "0x1714A5badf44F9Aade2E902eb083b80f6d4129a2", "created": 1623782581, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU5uMLaDiWyQCUVB4bXAbTtnKHsGuG7RKK2Qu1fb8MGGQ", "voter": "0xb87ae8c4Ae8ABAAB719e5eBCFA47a50168B709b4", "created": 1623782534, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX5APLMCs6cP85mYHow1snvLj5iuXjmqsZGFhaG1864za", "voter": "0x9D9c5583f5C1f22749072fbA4Fc2093abFcd524A", "created": 1623775725, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSNtkYHPAQXBvDKGJCjGhwcDiE636HKk18fCsXUCTwvWV", "voter": "0x76f387E6cAF280f4bb0bea75a1FF08c871Fc2D1a", "created": 1623775097, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfMgb99KqRACr8saBUJxdrm7x1233y16UqAuESvbqiDhN", "voter": "0x671813687Ef1C4F0Dcccd6940880b0CB790364ad", "created": 1623764612, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZPW1bMx7MRkKHzNy55uTd65CZFKMD53WSVz3hJxkcMxm", "voter": "0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2", "created": 1623732900, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcbtFsMApDfRMRABynycUNKUxjkDzQ98uUPYzomia2zv8", "voter": "0x6387a072e215021DbCcF590F692a719f34BF4930", "created": 1623699484, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXCv6DToubg8gCSZqt1b4884XW31M8sQbWZRkoZHKGx3x", "voter": "0xBAfe6495E9BCBB78F3534a60980c3AaDbA74157B", "created": 1623697588, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
