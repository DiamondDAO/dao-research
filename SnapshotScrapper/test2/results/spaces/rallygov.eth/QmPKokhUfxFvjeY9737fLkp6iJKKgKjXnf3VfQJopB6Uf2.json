To date, we've made sure to keep most of the original Rally team off of the Rally Registry so that it's primarily creators that drive new proposals.  However, Ira is becoming much more active in governance which is fantastic for the Rally community given her legal background, and so want to empower her to create proposals.\n\nWith regards to Rob, we've previously let in key creator acquisition folks into the Registry such as me and Grant.  Rob is an extension of that and is already teeing up a bunch of high quality creators/brands.   Allowing him make proposals instead of asking someone else to do it will streamline things.\n\n\n- A \"Yes\" vote will approve Ira and Rob into the Registry/Snapshot, and enable them to submit proposals. \n\n- A \"No\" vote will deny Ira and Rob access to the Registry/Snapshot\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1610150400, "end": 1610323200, "snapshot": "11617133", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qma3T33hrLjHEtjjZStZyUeXQKVx2Wixhvyh7FcjUtJmiz", "voter": "0x6D97d65aDfF6771b31671443a6b9512104312d3D", "created": 1610276638, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXEAgiSJMt1tkm9Jsti4qGfy3GfzbrvV1AoPjPFzKBap8", "voter": "0x22a614388b89734DF8Bc13F8CDcF6854F2b74526", "created": 1610229202, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX3AKTaJvSF4rdcMfbeFX8GiCv3diXDQ7AdSvjBM6vK7Z", "voter": "0xEe2319094bBB69c3DF5f1d2E5Ef62fD2F20030a1", "created": 1610208244, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmcw4qgmw3Jw9WuGg888ez3oKYLpveKLsPs3JqG7waf8pZ", "voter": "0xE2cC777D59b4D354FF1D55aDd7579726d04430C0", "created": 1610162556, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc22RH3jQYAtVU8ibgdAVpeg4rnaYpEVJ4vAoFRHe6TxF", "voter": "0xADdC94AD74251792E52A4851591665ea0E8f7389", "created": 1610158205, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWxP9qqSGs5wFfmV2uaZAxg5RDkrkrSCJUo2g2a5aBj5U", "voter": "0x60b43c2E5694dDFb73fBEa9e81a73ac26Bde5bDc", "created": 1610153321, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmegJa3kCVPXo54CGHysqmd3SSxLkq5R5rYCmUpaQZs6i8", "voter": "0x0F497f082539a8D92EA1c0573456fbcd9f2e4B33", "created": 1610153244, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY82mtApcgCd3Zxoy6SKEZ7F8ZNVKLgRbwzWoYuM8skdt", "voter": "0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2", "created": 1610150684, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
