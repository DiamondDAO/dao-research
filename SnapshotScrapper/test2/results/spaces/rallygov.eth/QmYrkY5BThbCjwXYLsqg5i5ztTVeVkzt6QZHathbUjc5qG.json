With his key executive and leadership roles at companies like Tabuan Group, AEG Presents, Live Nation, Radical Media, Ticketmaster and 247tickets, Robb has been able to define and execute strategies for live music, festivals, sports and digital media experiences around the world. Part of his expertise stems from his understanding of the international entertainment industry, including cultural nuances for content and entertainment consumption in each territory across Asia, India and the Middle East. He has led diverse, cross-functional teams working with superstar artists like Ed Sheeran, Shawn Mendes, Beyonc\u00e9, Katy Perry, Maroon 5, Coldplay, Sam Smith, BIG BANG and Imagine Dragons to connect them meaningfully with their worldwide fan base.\n \nRobb is passionate about helping creators capitalize on technology innovations to develop new revenue streams, and that\u2019s where things get exciting for Rally. As one of the Rally network\u2019s core missions is to empower creators to build and own their customized digital economies, global audiences are a huge factor in expanding the Rally community beyond anything we\u2019ve previously been able to do. Due to the unique business and cultural characteristics of overseas markets, it will require an expert to facilitate these efforts - and Robb is well positioned to help the Rally network get there.  \n \nHis collaboration with Rally would enable the community to effectively engage audiences throughout Asia, India, the Middle East, and beyond. He would advise on international strategy, compliance and payment structures, international talent and platform partnerships, people strategy and all elements of go-to-market priorities at an international scale.  \n\nCheck out his intro video and full the Discourse Discussion here: https://forum.rally.io/t/community-engagement-proposal-robb-spitzer-for-international-expansion/894/10\n\nThe advisory arrangement is as follows:\n\n - 166,666 $RLY per month for a period of 6 months from Advisors and Collaborators pool, plus $25K USDC per month from the Rally community treasury.\n - Full-time focus on Rally.\n - During this period, KPIs will be established and achievements will be shared with the community for review.\n - At the end of the 6 month period, the community will have the opportunity to evaluate the engagement and, if the community decides to extend the engagement, it can do so through a new proposal. \n\n **A YES vote for this proposal would approve Robb Spitzer to be engaged to enable international expansion of the the Rally network based on the terms detailed above.**\n\n**A NO vote will result in no engagement.**\n\n\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1619157600, "end": 1619330400, "snapshot": "12294682", "state": "closed", "author": "0xADdC94AD74251792E52A4851591665ea0E8f7389", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVQQdu85QrcdSYXAFnYkHSzk899WGKUs2ssYFDxWspemH", "voter": "0x3637d7F6041D73917017e5d3E2259473215ecf6f", "created": 1619243035, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS2E5neE9zmDycMW4DPzgSgWZMZehxYMWEhAxrTGnhpe1", "voter": "0x5ea400d06Afe7aebae54216aDfD7a4bF5f15F993", "created": 1619224932, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcPHgX51rVS3Snv8ZdWm1dGRqW3auvB2ENPBimJGWZHL1", "voter": "0x231557D79f2320a46cC61D97070a7d64664ED2df", "created": 1619220175, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPsGLQhhsdmxyTt4setKkDP5xFrSzjZX138Ny9FSF4oaw", "voter": "0x778a9fe6c408211a41Cdb7F17A32E1e42F5641f5", "created": 1619214691, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRqwx7iTtHzV2PCxsvRbqHGDSvp2MDWc22Q3C7VEXmEcQ", "voter": "0x3f3B4c780dCFC39B24B0d09b1f1f1cF133b733D5", "created": 1619196065, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTPU6ALCCqQrAB3bffBxxFz2M8BURqFMnvaS9exQ6YhDE", "voter": "0x893D2E776F21143354123241bC1DC237C47BC3fC", "created": 1619195691, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUykb5TCwJXregqpsTmjGambtZQdos75JtT2TvREJdNGy", "voter": "0xc6AB6e61df9da48fe9a83baFE45faa54D42dabA0", "created": 1619195293, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS3bQhDtLMgDYd1FeUZDLfUJkZR6NpWiWHwCLmj22bcGp", "voter": "0x31D33391f918BbD845bEb0Ef23CAFeb74dc498E3", "created": 1619179031, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPKgFPLfd5iPNopcxqPtUJJtu2RLqVUddqvmbqLrowZGT", "voter": "0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2", "created": 1619157616, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
