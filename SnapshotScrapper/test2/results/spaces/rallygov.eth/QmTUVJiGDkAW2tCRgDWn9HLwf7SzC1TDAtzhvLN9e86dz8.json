This will make the breakdown as the following:\n\nUniswap RLY/ETH - 35%\nBalancer RLY/ETH 10/90 - 13%\nBalancer RLY/USDC 10/90 - 13%\nBalancer RLY/ETH 90/10 - 13%\nBalancer RLY/USDC 90/10 - 13%\ny3Crv Pool - 13%\n\nAlternatives: We can do a lower amount for the Uniswap allocation (30, or 25) instead of 35.\n\nUniswap RLY/ETH - 35% = Re-allocate rewards to Uniswap pool so it makes up 35% of total LM rewards per block\n\nUniswap RLY/ETH - 30% = Re-allocate rewards to Uniswap pool so it makes up 30% of total LM rewards per block\n\nUniswap RLY/ETH - 25% = Re-allocate rewards to Uniswap pool so it makes up 25% of total LM rewards per block\n\nNot in favor = No change to the current liquidity mining rewards\n\nDiscourse discussion thread: https://forum.rally.io/t/proposal-to-further-incentivise-the-uniswap-rly-eth-liquidity-pool/86\n\n\n", "choices": ["Uniswap RLY/ETH - 35%", "Uniswap RLY/ETH - 30%", "Uniswap RLY/ETH - 25%", "Not in favor"], "start": 1603911600, "end": 1604084400, "snapshot": "11146093", "state": "closed", "author": "0x565B93a15d38aCD79c120b15432D21E21eD274d6", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
