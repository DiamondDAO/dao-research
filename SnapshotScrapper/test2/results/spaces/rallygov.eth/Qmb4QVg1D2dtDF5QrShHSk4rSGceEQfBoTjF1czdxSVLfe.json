{"id": "Qmb4QVg1D2dtDF5QrShHSk4rSGceEQfBoTjF1czdxSVLfe", "title": "Community Treasury Approval: Infrastructure and Engineering Funding Request", "body": "This proposal recommends allocating up to $1,704,000 from the Rally Community Treasury to be spent on the adoption of tools and services for a 12 month period, in order to fund engineering and development, security, and scalability/performance priorities to get the Rally infrastructure ready for the next phase of growth. Key areas of focus include:\n - Monitoring and Alerting\n - Load and Stress Testing\n - DevOps Consulting\n - Economic Alerting & Monitoring\n - Anti botting / Fraud detection\n - Mobile Application(s)\n\nPlease review the Discourse forum discussion for full details, a breakdown of the total budget, and an in-depth community discussion: https://forum.rally.io/t/proposal-rally-infrastructure-engineering-funding-request/1114\n \n**Summary/Abstract:**\nThe budget requested would be to cover a 12 month period for the following areas:\n\nMonitoring and Alerting: This proposal recommends engaging DataDog, currently in use on a trial basis. Funding will enable additional instrumentation to enable improvement of code and infrastructure and to provide insight into Rally systems without major engineering work.  Requested budget required for this tool: $144,000 (12 months)\n\nLoad and Stress Testing: This funding will enable build/outsource of a comprehensive suite of load/stress tests to discover bottlenecks and ensure various parts of the Rally infrastructure system can handle load end to end.  Requested budget required for such tools: $180,000 (12 months)\n\nDevOps Consulting: Foghorn consulting (specifically FogOps) is recommended to supplement existing DevOps engineering efforts to audit Rally systems for security and performance and ensure Rally is using the latest technologies and best practices.  Requested budget required for this tool: $288,000 (12 months)\n\nEconomic Alerting and Monitoring: This spend is recommended for economic alerting and monitoring of value fluctuations and calculations. Quantiphi is an AWS partner that could help with Data Engineering and AI/ML and help set up the data infrastructure.  Requested budget required for this engagement: $432,000 (12 months)\n\nAnti botting / Fraud detection: Addressing bots and fraud is a high priority for Rally and the community. Investing in the right tools can help detect or mitigate against use of bots to commit fraud, and fraud detection tools can help detect and prevent bad behavior and not allow a few bad actors to affect the entire community.  Requested budget required for such tools: $180,000 (12 months)\n\nMobile Application(s): Developing mobile apps would help the spread the use and adoption of Rally and help with MFA, providing more security within the Rally ecosystem.  Certain use cases for creator coins can be a separate app, or an app that allows creators to white label their own apps to manage their own coins/ NFTs within their community.  Requested budget required for such tools: $480,000 (12 months)\n\n**Total requested estimated budget for 12 months: $1,704,000**\n\n**Proposal**\n\n - **A Yes vote would approve the budget and spending outlined above, based on the rationale outlined in this proposal and the associated Discourse discussion.**\n\n - **A No vote would result in rejection of this proposal.**\n \n \n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1626151500, "end": 1626324300, "snapshot": "12816717", "state": "closed", "author": "0xADdC94AD74251792E52A4851591665ea0E8f7389", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZrX7wyh1MDBt8iKzz6V1Kkmm2KCqakJsX83296ZyBgaP", "voter": "0x203D21200Ef6456A733220f225BB375316F65B7B", "created": 1626275101, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTyCj3qAyo976gDghCLGjBf2AWEnDgY4Mvr1ZBrFqL7zx", "voter": "0x3637d7F6041D73917017e5d3E2259473215ecf6f", "created": 1626242876, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYn1T6qg8W2u8kS8sNoujNcSiSKev2CzsYqAGkqbuR5jS", "voter": "0xE2cC777D59b4D354FF1D55aDd7579726d04430C0", "created": 1626213993, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdQ8YQ9fG4DyeZejBGyRxQbGYWFUMzanbLvT87a9nsZat", "voter": "0x6D8f5e1b330edcf028dc14EfD46d87FEfAA58A7F", "created": 1626212830, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXsGXXEjumRT4a3STrSqR7e6pchwsN4aLcXfLqFoV1LCs", "voter": "0x22a614388b89734DF8Bc13F8CDcF6854F2b74526", "created": 1626210616, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcFEtpRR3qs423m3BztqFoYbtsfZFKdozN2X2JtK7YPXy", "voter": "0x72E306661217bfA16961326b10d4527EB5D0D299", "created": 1626206421, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaziRbBPd7owZrhBNqAuABX7fLuQ4KcYcsSfyFWF2T27D", "voter": "0x11B4E83BC3e9605F03E2A4C34BD09567be5aeBBE", "created": 1626197127, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRDvcP1XpntS4xTXtMGGMkK2UiM8fezzuA9khohErRj3k", "voter": "0x0e52B9228F901b393C182a5C30f2a10dB2Ae247b", "created": 1626196525, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmctYWwrqGnbnvMh91GqTMaVzxvr2oQQbYBxzrtLvqVuoB", "voter": "0xb51b62028bDe4d3a9402bF402d3b7a1eA30c02fe", "created": 1626196408, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTcu9VpspuQwsfB8hsgu1W7dnRW4UGnHKaM4gciq7zXXX", "voter": "0x16cB461d27a84f3B096E4950458f8828347D0A26", "created": 1626195658, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUHrW7LZ3PMgfFya5hhoVMViY4iuthXzBuoABYMXJqnMo", "voter": "0x7Fb9b559c1164257Cca50F5a131fDDf85466E80c", "created": 1626189997, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbsqBZgXLKVSgYQQiW2Wqq4fXwGdEhcwsvMK87PN67CdN", "voter": "0x231557D79f2320a46cC61D97070a7d64664ED2df", "created": 1626184552, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaH88eHhGxK1pgtCE7eBFKXU8LgDFofnsBNiFPiU5tFzM", "voter": "0x05B4AF87e6532E7bF64b3C3BB6ACCd7526D9A774", "created": 1626182935, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSRHztbYac1E326obs2tmMdrnj1Bp2tgT5aoUdk4sZ5a5", "voter": "0xD40011295C2f7CA0e84da5dba48dd7ee6Bb4ED34", "created": 1626181090, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPzXrr1TKBkcd9SKbAurH1NXPje8XjMRuDMovBPwtjBcJ", "voter": "0x3f3B4c780dCFC39B24B0d09b1f1f1cF133b733D5", "created": 1626153061, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVgnKM4YQu78BDe9Nhy6mUa5WCscScsEKw9oeJ4Ly9pqZ", "voter": "0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2", "created": 1626151992, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
