This program would also manage a pool of $RLY to be used for rewarding those contributions.\n\nThis program would be called the Developer Bounty Program, and its purpose will be to reward developers for their work in supporting the Rally Network and its users.\n\nA **Yes** vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\n\n1. Deploy $RLY from the Developer and Strategic Partnerships pool, to fund the Developer Bounty Program with an initial supply of 1,000,000 $RLY in a secure multi-sig safe, address here: 0xaE17A6D1592b73b913f94032dD273C4796A8d3aD\n\n2. Establish the Bounty Administration with the following authority:\n- Access and control $RLY allocated to the program, with the authorization to grant these funds to reward engineering efforts of community members in the Rally Network developer ecosystem.\n- Design any sub-programs or initiatives relevant to support the above engineering efforts [2.a].\n- Manage/Administer communications roles within Rally community tools (such as: Discord, Discourse, etc.)\n\n3. Approve the first Bounty Administrators.  Initially, the Bounty Administrators will be members of the Rally Network team in order to safely launch the program. At a later date, additional Bounty Administrators will be selected, approved and removed by the community.", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1603245600, "end": 1603418400, "snapshot": "11096601", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5b8f87A44bB45AB9cF8B5Af970a0db51C337a25C", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
