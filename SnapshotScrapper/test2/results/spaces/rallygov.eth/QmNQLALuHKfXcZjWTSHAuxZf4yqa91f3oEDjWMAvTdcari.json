The Man and helped guide them towards a successful launch. He is all-in on social tokens and wants to start an agency specifically geared towards bringing big name musicians onto Rally.  More on Josh, including a video explanation from him, in this Discourse thread: https://forum.rally.io/t/rly-grant-structure-for-businesses-building-atop-rally/188\n\nIn this grant structure, the Initial Grant is meant to provide a relatively small amount of \u201cseed funding\u201d to help Josh get his agency off the ground and kick off a fundraise.  The larger Scaling Grant is contingent upon a successful fundraise for his agency and has a max cap. \n\nThis is a simple structure that also aligns incentives in a way that puts skin in the game for both the Rally community and Josh. \n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would approve a 250k $RLY grant to Josh Katz\u2019s agency from the Creator, Brand and Community Partnerships pool with no vesting terms, and also authorize a future grant should conditions be met.  \n\nA No vote for this proposal would result in no change.\n\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1612134000, "end": 1612306800, "snapshot": "11766599", "state": "closed", "author": "0x893D2E776F21143354123241bC1DC237C47BC3fC", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 17, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVcDaZiVf6iZEB2b3qjerwYwp7dQqVFCZhqoEFvQ4hm47", "voter": "0x323AFc6d2DbE2Eb0AE71Ed1f87db8956834E861d", "created": 1612288459, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNTnRwXucBGVPh6PSRGoQubDpfmYVEDJMFjjBu6aBZNe8", "voter": "0xF723d05F10E8503FEaBA5CFBb9A5513Eb8ECbfd6", "created": 1612278209, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZc4k59ffnCZxkwqxKSYZVBgsjFue4WUNFPTy1MjadAme", "voter": "0x7606537AA57C29A0f54249Bd7f236F82D782ee0A", "created": 1612263384, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTR3JhiRbacYt3asmioSVai3XDitMjt2woH3TgtzzkAAK", "voter": "0xa911ccf5F6C7BD5fb25188D41A536890c3c8fAE5", "created": 1612259334, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWHcVB7Qk5Pb5UhoyUUMfe13bVv5GBNxvDrBhYwnpLLcS", "voter": "0x3637d7F6041D73917017e5d3E2259473215ecf6f", "created": 1612254435, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSCvfJdRMxYx6hpUpCrDUkPENvQVQsjMgh7MpC3q5y7AF", "voter": "0xB57537d47F88c09E6e585D539d5915fedF2259cE", "created": 1612249202, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQtYXZLrnVaEZ24zrDW5D2pAfkkqBZX2uD48rDn2N6pRe", "voter": "0xEe2319094bBB69c3DF5f1d2E5Ef62fD2F20030a1", "created": 1612246171, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPTAAgVeUQnGZLnGjdqyNS77JqvuesD4JHhqKrGYSmfAW", "voter": "0x744b130afb4E0DFb99868B7A64a1F934b69004C4", "created": 1612241911, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaRzmprCNKryNTQbvTfECdZ8D3zyYKYGVggXLeuEFXtSK", "voter": "0xa1e4270381e381E75ef6e4dDa1a27337a4Be0939", "created": 1612241834, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmevKjNTYrFuu44pAhqQz6vsHebfn9jbAEmV24TT2vvUUZ", "voter": "0x893D2E776F21143354123241bC1DC237C47BC3fC", "created": 1612235866, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXVYcYuphcbxGod2w8DvtfgBkGKr3BJbcJY5eeDATvr6g", "voter": "0xC2D201037bDF8F7fe905F1073106Bf4385b65A6f", "created": 1612233711, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmea2QxDmG1C7BWp8YaeJGQZVRT2t6sm32BJFQpwSmh1pt", "voter": "0x34D6508B607Af072858E64c65cEd6e7993225E32", "created": 1612233420, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaTypuv1MRXhoJpknmcBA14Yitc89io9xYR87pa8PYAiY", "voter": "0x3f3B4c780dCFC39B24B0d09b1f1f1cF133b733D5", "created": 1612204180, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbAQE8nRgZujqNYdK5GGdy2vKzrSZvaQHv8joAotC2cwH", "voter": "0xccda0716ec78202812c7F5947e8e801461aC38C4", "created": 1612185081, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTu2h6CPe6PAiy7g7731DfqE4khjSuJ6fUBaAD2HVuAYx", "voter": "0xADdC94AD74251792E52A4851591665ea0E8f7389", "created": 1612148799, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPHh4CWc8zsxPjRzL2jTDZXMKKhurXkjfSJmiy6mzCC5T", "voter": "0xE2cC777D59b4D354FF1D55aDd7579726d04430C0", "created": 1612140895, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSFbCSmzujgAKwFprw9xj57ajjb9x9ymfipirg3cq5M7g", "voter": "0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2", "created": 1612135142, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
