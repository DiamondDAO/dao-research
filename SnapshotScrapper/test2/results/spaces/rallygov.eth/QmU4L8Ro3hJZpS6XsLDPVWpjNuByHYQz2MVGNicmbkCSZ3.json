It will bring more focus to Rally creators, drive market education about creator coins, enlist increased support for creator coin economics from brands, and drive attention from mainstream media. It will be a building block to support other efforts already underway by the Rally marketing team and the recently approved liquidity program. Finally, it will be led by a Rally community member and help directly impact metrics important to the network such as new creator recruitment, creator success, and the rapid scaling of market awareness and consumer participation.\n\nThis proposal has been discussed at length in the forum. For the full discussion, please review the Discourse forum posts here: https://forum.rally.io/t/proposal-new-media-opportunity-that-can-help-grow-the-rally-creator-and-social-token-economy/1018\n\n\n**Background**\nBret Kinsella is the creator of $BOT Coin which grew out of his work founding Voicebot.ai and Voicebot Research. Those organizations established the central source for data, news, and analysis for the growing voice AI community in 2016. They served to educate the market and bring together entrepreneurs, tech giants, and consumer brands to grow the industry collaboratively. Several Rally creators recognized that a similar solution could benefit the creator economy in general and the Rally Network and Rally creators in particular. \n\nThe project will consist of an online publication, podcast, and research organization that will cultivate audiences among creators, consumer brand marketers, and other news media. This is not a $BOT Coin project but instead is designed to support all Rally creators and the network as a whole. \n\nThe new organization will not be limited to covering Rally as it will be important to draw a larger audience that is generally interested in the business and technology of the creator economy. This will give the areas of focus around Rally greater reach. However, the proposed funding from Rally is requested to accelerate the program and build out the Rally-specific elements so the impact can be generated sooner. \n\n**The Rally community is expected to benefit in several ways from this initiative:**\n- Generate more awareness for Rally creators among brands and other organizations with budgets for influencer marketing campaigns that could be integrated with creator coin projects\n- Generate more awareness for Rally creators among media by providing a platform for independent exposure through a specialist media and research organization that backs analysis with concrete data\n- Provide an independent source of information about Rally that can help educate businesses, media, and others\n- Provide resources for creators to help them better manage and add value to their coin economies\n- Raise awareness among creators that Rally is an attractive option for building their businesses and enlisting them before they choose alternative social token solution\n \nBret Kinsella and his organization EdgeLens LLC are particularly well suited to deliver these benefits because of their experience building Voicebot.ai, past experience hiring and collaborating with dozens of creators/influencers, and in-depth knowledge of Rally. If approved, the project will begin in June 2021. More details are provided in the forum discussion. \n\n**Metrics**\nTo provide visibility to the Rally community, EdgeLens will publish summary metrics and activities in the Rally Discord on at least a quarterly basis related to growth, Rally-related resources, and Rally exposure. Bret Kinsella will also host an online discussion after the first three months to discuss the project and field questions from the community.  \n\n**Proposal**\nThis proposal will grant EdgeLens LLC 16k $RLY per month for six months from the Community Treasury to develop the project described above. \n\n**A Yes vote for this proposal would approve the payment of this grant. A No vote would result in rejection of this proposal.**\n", "choices": ["YES", "NO"], "start": 1622656800, "end": 1622829600, "snapshot": "12556521", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXjDA28PVcTfwGpqKiNoH7MMqtNkUNLEDRE3nLW6eenx9", "voter": "0x3637d7F6041D73917017e5d3E2259473215ecf6f", "created": 1622709096, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSDQg5XGuYjPYK7D9oWNErc8ZkMNyfz4RkPvZ2FPveL7f", "voter": "0x34D6508B607Af072858E64c65cEd6e7993225E32", "created": 1622687980, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcXYiFR4tDzT1qLyLiKtzW9jnNhjttHQoLK98z86dRbNF", "voter": "0x671813687Ef1C4F0Dcccd6940880b0CB790364ad", "created": 1622670070, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPXDk98dPXKdHfXXkh3D6rpy4995bcXyxm1M5W1bPhxqx", "voter": "0x4C86150C946c8FA03c9E5117B130C765ca5e5d72", "created": 1622668121, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ9BXGF2bFXyBrgiowDZA1C6HoZYth7Q1R8pB5hGjTvEG", "voter": "0xE2cC777D59b4D354FF1D55aDd7579726d04430C0", "created": 1622665626, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd3v1xUy3QdH5rm7vbV7bD5yjQQbwMJyFiGwJLN54fxTS", "voter": "0x16cB461d27a84f3B096E4950458f8828347D0A26", "created": 1622660647, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPkH6jguKn5t1UaRL8CjCaD8FdNpHL1fvp95MeMnqVKhd", "voter": "0xAd03653F01D62C2927CACa07c25e324eb5F32f8a", "created": 1622660599, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVyHxuKSPp98vviWuL49HS2v4zKuuPSJsZ3QfemK8TJg3", "voter": "0x231557D79f2320a46cC61D97070a7d64664ED2df", "created": 1622659567, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfH3eLs5y3SCBbbEvYtsHkfP6Pj25yQwJruf78dU7T2G2", "voter": "0x7DB7Af0061587d89B30F7D1a3C3179fbA45dbDD2", "created": 1622659158, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSBEifxGVhKWaCTDr9amv9Kkv2PrGFwCgQX7hdjTZrWaK", "voter": "0x9D9c5583f5C1f22749072fbA4Fc2093abFcd524A", "created": 1622657369, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbDEL8NvAT41Y18SqWUf4YH8zQeSyseZxwfdyMgwLMtSa", "voter": "0xF1308ee3dC6fCcabFcb4FEEf685B90DA2f54B8a6", "created": 1622657267, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
