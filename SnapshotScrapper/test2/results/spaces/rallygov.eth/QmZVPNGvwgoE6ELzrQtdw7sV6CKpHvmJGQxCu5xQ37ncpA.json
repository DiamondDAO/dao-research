He recently served as the Head of Go-to-Market and Revenue for Patreon, where he built out an organization that drove the adoption of Patreon\u2019s platform and the success of the creators on the platform. He currently advises creator projects Run The World, Playbook Technologies, STATIONHEAD, and Mine\u2019d on their creator adoption, engagement and monetization strategies.\n\nBremner's collaboration with the Rally Network would enable him to use his expertise to build go-to-market initiatives to drive further creator adoption of the Rally Network. In his activities, Bremner would oversee sales and marketing campaigns that will introduce Creator Coin to new, diverse creators and networks, and operationalize creator onboarding, enabling creators to successfully onboard and drive adoption of their Creator Coin economies. Additionally, Bremner would help increase the awareness of Rally\u2019s core value propositions through content marketing and brand marketing initiatives.\n\nCheck out his intro video and full the Discourse discussion here: https://forum.rally.io/t/engaging-bremner-morris-for-go-to-market-success/338\n\nThe collaboration terms will be as follows:\n\n - 166,666 $RLY per month for a period of 5 months from Advisors and Collaborators pool.\n - Roughly half-time focus on Rally, as Bremner has existing commitments to other creator projects.\n - During this period, KPIs will be established and achievements will be shared with the community for review.\n - At the end of the 5 month period, the community will have the opportunity to evaluate the engagement and, if the community decides to extend the engagement, it can do so through a new proposal.\n\n **A YES vote for this proposal would approve Bremner Morris's engagement for the Rally Network's go-to-market success and deploy 166,666 $RLY at the end of each month of completed service from the Advisors and Collaborators pool to his wallet address at 0x152A454aEeB33f3363BDfD49A4fFAD0AA585c12f.**\n\n**A NO vote will result in no engagement.**\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1613001600, "end": 1613174400, "snapshot": "11831832", "state": "closed", "author": "0xADdC94AD74251792E52A4851591665ea0E8f7389", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 15, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmew2kjYAp1z23ghtiWkWEwMoqqCmpisd1TbhHirFm492W", "voter": "0xab5110DAC36BFC00090496476A94A95F9eBAA9A4", "created": 1613164599, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZaoYaLaMe9QBTrcp4yq73uJjS9HxXNM1RtBWetMF9ruU", "voter": "0xccda0716ec78202812c7F5947e8e801461aC38C4", "created": 1613146179, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcugurCTDKu7bFP5XH56TbVEphGrSfYZY4sCSK73QHZ38", "voter": "0x6Db8199933Ff5cFAb685DfC266d7466483E10E7b", "created": 1613141992, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc8ecyMo3wUj6uDjBd1UqVVAAKU2QHNUPNJien76dvnG4", "voter": "0xFa1a866CC0C10759c660209eD28aFc6dd42A4c4E", "created": 1613135303, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYgeYi4Lf4uhSRSyya8kjJw7q9wee9rzWiGRBH3DYU2Zs", "voter": "0x98d048d809A00557f9762016B0803AC7c1337312", "created": 1613101185, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVrAFB9sckXTJTH6ijyZMd7TehUCzgKKwDqpqpsKUZCyR", "voter": "0x34D6508B607Af072858E64c65cEd6e7993225E32", "created": 1613100539, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma1hKLF4DBj7wzvxSYCx2jgspGkRiTGxkDxPnNB3Hdn29", "voter": "0xF723d05F10E8503FEaBA5CFBb9A5513Eb8ECbfd6", "created": 1613096552, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPSSEMWHdvnageY4yCFvg673eC7bza4KL78yUT62SM4Mg", "voter": "0x7721F140C2968D5C639A9B40a1e6CA48a9b7c41D", "created": 1613064322, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUwVqFKo7cJ2hbbsPSb951MGC5WDXf1TJo6aApD7uzQTe", "voter": "0x323AFc6d2DbE2Eb0AE71Ed1f87db8956834E861d", "created": 1613059469, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf8dwC53ZqdTqWC6nhqUaTT7tmn926pBRTMg97dSLy8yJ", "voter": "0xE2cC777D59b4D354FF1D55aDd7579726d04430C0", "created": 1613025521, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNg2UuzLhQhw1DWQwGcxjFhXZur1zcTvh2KS6YwhyPk1D", "voter": "0x76f387E6cAF280f4bb0bea75a1FF08c871Fc2D1a", "created": 1613018185, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmccC253kbE7uSurK13kXEan1rmUw68MLBPBCt5pD4HV3X", "voter": "0x3637d7F6041D73917017e5d3E2259473215ecf6f", "created": 1613008816, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmau1PYvWrLG5uq2BvwVcu3s26qQAcdKDkiLGt9NPXZdKm", "voter": "0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2", "created": 1613005916, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYAXfxcV7i2AWxu9LRiz6BD3wWhMbPu9THA8beXgQj5Rp", "voter": "0x562Cc90d95a15BDe25F8d2D4b4358F8588cd59f9", "created": 1613005746, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUSYi3t8EU3zh1c7bdrEN7f4WoPxjmyLcWxkfUv8iSdmc", "voter": "0x893D2E776F21143354123241bC1DC237C47BC3fC", "created": 1613003433, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
