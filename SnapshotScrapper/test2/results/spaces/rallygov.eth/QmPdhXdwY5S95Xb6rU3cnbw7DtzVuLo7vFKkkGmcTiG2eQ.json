Beyond just referring them to the platform, I will break down creator token to each creator, guide and propose use cases around their token, help communicate those on social media and will amplify on my channels. For 5 tokens referred, that means $1.25k worth of $RLY to alexmasmej.eth.\n\nMotivation:\n\n$ALEX is arguably the first creator token. I could onboard 5 people a month on average that are either in crypto or adjacent, like in tech or entertainment.\n\nI have a unique edge because my audience and reputation mean that I get inbounds of people wanting help for their social tokens, so I have the leverage to be a Rally ambassador; plus, my growing Twitter audience is very receptive to social tokens announcements.\n\nTarget launch: ASAP if passed\n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\n\nAllocate $250 worth of $RLY to alexmasmej.eth disbursed monthly.\n", "choices": ["Yes \ud83e\udd29", "No \ud83d\udc4e"], "start": 1605200400, "end": 1605373200, "snapshot": "11240386", "state": "closed", "author": "0xD3e9D60e4E4De615124D5239219F32946d10151D", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmfJB6gKuH5jemxLTVPnVhS8VJkDxtoLiz1NfzvFiYbGi9", "voter": "0xD3e9D60e4E4De615124D5239219F32946d10151D", "created": 1605291863, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUKFJtng2hD616BHXNAgqTp42oj8teZVZgnzY6h64dy8G", "voter": "0x22a614388b89734DF8Bc13F8CDcF6854F2b74526", "created": 1605276808, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaeYhdUTkSQn6H5h8LQ4Xfps6FaKGmKPG8VpCSv9TyQVy", "voter": "0xE2cC777D59b4D354FF1D55aDd7579726d04430C0", "created": 1605257934, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcnarMc57bGG4D6sYVB7HGN7bhw6HJgz7kZfzxJRKyz7x", "voter": "0x3f3B4c780dCFC39B24B0d09b1f1f1cF133b733D5", "created": 1605250536, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZPBRHbguc3YE66WPdpxXkAm4AhSFjMBA6sh6pFQfdSEq", "voter": "0xF627E5F4BAd95a956468d8BB6Ee20b119F992E96", "created": 1605250163, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQfVcw7btwkwb2vZuRFAiBSsXfPYezuH3wmp7xsZkzuAB", "voter": "0x893D2E776F21143354123241bC1DC237C47BC3fC", "created": 1605244244, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
