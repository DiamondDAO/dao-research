They are feted for their idiosyncratic, arguably eccentric, approach to creating and documenting contemporary cultural movements. Moving into crypto makes perfect sense as they are renown for innovating in the digital space, through projects such as their No Miming Freestyle series as well as Just Jam, their pioneering live stream.\n\n[Social]\nTim & Barry\nhttp://youtube.com/timandbarrytv\nhttps://www.instagram.com/timandbarry\nhttp://twitter.com/timandbarry\nhttps://www.facebook.com/timandbarrytv\n\nJust Jam\nhttps://www.instagram.com/justjamlive/\nhttp://twitter.com/justjamlive\nhttps://www.facebook.com/JustJamLive\n\n[Use Cases]\nDistribution\nSoft Launch - We plan to announce the coin before the official launch via our socials to gain hype.\nYouTube premieres - Using the launch of our new freestyle series we will give away $TAB at the end of the episode video premieres on YouTube.\n\nHolding Mechanics\nExclusive content - We plan to give $TAB Coin holders exclusive previews of new content and allow them to nominate their favourite new musicians for the series.\nLive event access - On the return of our live Just Jam events we plan to reward $TAB holders with exclusive access to events, as well as top holders being invited to intimate studio recordings.\n\nTransactions\nRemix competitions - With the release of freestyles we will also hold a remix competition, audio stems of the recording will be available to producers for purchase via $TAB.
