Thus a link has been provided to reference the original proposal._\n\nIn the original proposal, we proposed a part time role for moderating Rally community discussion. In light of a recent notable increase in activity in the Creator Coin & $RLY Discord, especially during the hours from 5pm - 8am PT, we seek to increase Soul's hours to keep up with this demand. and to be a voice for the community to respond to and educate the community at large.\n\nCompensation for being a full time Community Ambassador is $4500 USDC and 50,000 RLY on the 1st of each month. After the 6-month term, scope of role and performance to be reviewed for continuation/renewal.\n\n* A \"Yes\" vote will approve Soul of Jacobeh as a Full Time Community Ambassador.\n* A \"No\" vote will deny Soul of Jacobeh as a Full Time Community Ambassador.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1611000000, "end": 1611172800, "snapshot": "11680653", "state": "closed", "author": "0xBbD378951fB947eef963C096F46d04420F97905B", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSxjNy2HMKPYtLYha63vAEVPGXQNUZAxDiQmES1ExXRQg", "voter": "0x34D6508B607Af072858E64c65cEd6e7993225E32", "created": 1611148734, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdEGPw1cvizWRPtsA6VMboMj9xVnu8w61W6xE52vjZhMr", "voter": "0xa614869e9b3deEC7c04383062479d9403FE6bA17", "created": 1611126408, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRCYZ5Bz8b537QyY6EsszzTH2DuGJtNM3GjsAv4e6gS6h", "voter": "0x3f3B4c780dCFC39B24B0d09b1f1f1cF133b733D5", "created": 1611078405, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmdma8RyXcvxVQABhMDmiKX4yAahJ42yAALSmrGRu2m2wh", "voter": "0x189D67633BB902281D44FC3E933e7605e74C2dA7", "created": 1611073466, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVgPesr6hNXqBSPzGg5h13ji86cu4HVA9RqTY81LvR2Ro", "voter": "0x3637d7F6041D73917017e5d3E2259473215ecf6f", "created": 1611042478, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfWkhvgMd56pimL4bCMDdGr2oq4wk3zanAFfFDUmA8x1Y", "voter": "0xADdC94AD74251792E52A4851591665ea0E8f7389", "created": 1611032137, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmdn2D2fa36Uy6WCCm9bDaeRrcj7rkhmN6YTQxeGpbDyWn", "voter": "0xEe2319094bBB69c3DF5f1d2E5Ef62fD2F20030a1", "created": 1611012015, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXEZ8ppvDK3RkGMGF8VnbxGCjJquXbiobyCxH56frxNJC", "voter": "0x744b130afb4E0DFb99868B7A64a1F934b69004C4", "created": 1611001523, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZNbQMmyiBGFecqL1vJQTU5hBnGJ869KMyEoVFVJbd9dy", "voter": "0x323AFc6d2DbE2Eb0AE71Ed1f87db8956834E861d", "created": 1611001508, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQR66bw6CD2hqRYrm7j9M1656rQvKF9Gx9Axp91G1HN4F", "voter": "0x893D2E776F21143354123241bC1DC237C47BC3fC", "created": 1611000833, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQVKEQzh2HF436t1Hop6msQV3q6BC9o937fmF47YAE1M1", "voter": "0xb51b62028bDe4d3a9402bF402d3b7a1eA30c02fe", "created": 1611000625, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTfd5NVNjtzGxbVmo6vVsPiGvdAKhU3FHGBrsVoJkLcMm", "voter": "0x76f387E6cAF280f4bb0bea75a1FF08c871Fc2D1a", "created": 1611000310, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmULjfdUWZ8SyyGD8r2DcLqGd3xcwUy7XwZ3gJ29HFt5A5", "voter": "0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2", "created": 1611000286, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
