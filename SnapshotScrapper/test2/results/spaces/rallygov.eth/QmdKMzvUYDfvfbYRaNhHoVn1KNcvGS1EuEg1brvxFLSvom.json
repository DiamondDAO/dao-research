Through these approvals, the Community Agent will determine the specific terms for any sale in its discretion, taking into account considerations such as counterparty interest and prevailing market conditions, and in all cases acting in the best interests of the Rally community.\n\nThis proposal recommends the retention of the approved lock up range of 6 to 24 months, and in addition authorizes the Community Agent to sell certain tranches of $RLY without lock up.  The Community Agent will continue to act in the best interests of the Rally Community, and accordingly will be tasked to balance such sales with the protection of market stability for $RLY.\n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would enable the Community Agent to sell certain tranches of $RLY without lockup.\n\nA No vote would result in the retention of the current community fundraise terms.\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1610778600, "end": 1610951400, "snapshot": "11657972", "state": "closed", "author": "0xADdC94AD74251792E52A4851591665ea0E8f7389", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmasbED7ZDAeVhWe8MyreTQEf9sYHaeqKTxB5mMeULqGvh", "voter": "0x893D2E776F21143354123241bC1DC237C47BC3fC", "created": 1610931363, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmdec5doihBQzjtDL1Grqo4oTBbTwHjBi5ubD9WeQQi5Xe", "voter": "0x0F497f082539a8D92EA1c0573456fbcd9f2e4B33", "created": 1610930379, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTrEWKirF8vxmutkF5sME8aXF4iVFcUYUAq9uCdN8rpvd", "voter": "0x68575571E75D2CfA4222e0F8E7053F056EB91d6C", "created": 1610924027, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX1Kaa9jffKrcBnerDmi29ck5tMnh5NQfC6BFLoaaioV8", "voter": "0x3f3B4c780dCFC39B24B0d09b1f1f1cF133b733D5", "created": 1610906560, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmboVwx18FRkHgoG4v7oct6BEz66WET4U3PP7qsVXHkzDy", "voter": "0x85AcC988d311Db62cf45280C3174758c9681B8E2", "created": 1610867668, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZRHxFftBCHEiNRbYMmbYuhL6xM9d9Vwx2kfNxpYgAv5s", "voter": "0x744b130afb4E0DFb99868B7A64a1F934b69004C4", "created": 1610867626, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUqXpoqramZkr34zvK7RG59FUk1VaPEcYffAKFKYGhhdY", "voter": "0x323AFc6d2DbE2Eb0AE71Ed1f87db8956834E861d", "created": 1610867606, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVZ7RbeLR4EQiMfFe4Xx7oUxEUXLsBX88SppeV5bnp6qr", "voter": "0xe9B27E6b479a9FBBA4AC16091f1369e08BC31dF4", "created": 1610847074, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQYZXuk2izjfbno7mBDERZQ5snU4ezrvXB3LPdCYxQwEs", "voter": "0x1714A5badf44F9Aade2E902eb083b80f6d4129a2", "created": 1610845171, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXV5NWWAnAPz887dtj1cAf4ZKPKGP5MfurjQn8aP4hfXt", "voter": "0x76f387E6cAF280f4bb0bea75a1FF08c871Fc2D1a", "created": 1610845017, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmeo1ZzJDGi86erN5UUb1nj41dUE6yAKrumgZ6o7QmMSXX", "voter": "0x4caE8Bc922b604879A18a291C349f68b6AdAF638", "created": 1610833982, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRivDLxBxveRAb4QXs432KxGc3gzBspUcqhwPM5J79Y5X", "voter": "0x7806433c2F3069599FA8B0F27980Dc54Aa441b9B", "created": 1610833522, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
