{"id": "QmaSRXkV5jMPdAD3nVdeBWF8YakqooVBBj7xxjuHQBVRZV", "title": "Creator Review Council - Finalists", "body": "Proposal\nPrevious: https://snapshot.org/#/rally/proposal/QmX4RvUHKxMehPB3TB2wgFsVpy16zjwgRGnkHHgt2JKK6u\n\nOn Mar 14, the Rally Community voted to approve of the Creator Review Council (CRC) to represent the Community in reviewing of candidates for Creator Coins. The CRC replaces the use of Snapshot proposals for individual Creator Coin candidates.\n\nIn keeping with our ethos of Community Governance, we decided on the following course of action:\n\n1. All community candidates are listed in this single Rally Snapshot proposal. Candidates are listed by Preferred Name and a short bio (4 sentences max).\n2. Voters will select a single candidate. (Snapshot voting does not allow for multi-selection.)\n3. The voting process will last 72 hours. After 72 hours, the 3 candidates with the highest aggregate scores will be named to the Creator Review Council, along with 2 members of Rally Staff, for a total number of 5 CRC members.\n\nHere are the finalists (in order of submission):\n\nVooka\nI was led to Rally as a fan initially, by TMFA (been a big fan of Matty Mo for a while now). I consume everything Rally-related: forums, snapshot proposals, the team's social feeds, and of course everything on the Discord server. I'm very familiar with twitch and the communities there and I'm also immersed in hype geek culture which doesn't apply to all creators but will certainly be useful when analyzing creators for the younger crowds. I believe I would have a unique insight when judging which early creators would excel on the platform and whether or not they should be prioritized over others.\n\nMatt MacDonald ($CRIME coin)\nI've been independently releasing albums via Kickstarter since 2011, and I've successfully funded over two dozen Kickstarter projects for other creators, and I've never had a project go unfunded. I believe in the promise of Rally for creators like myself and others in my circle. In my years of helping launch Kickstarters and build release marketing plans for independent musicians and creators, I've sharpened my ability to assess 1.) A creators actual reach and engagement and 2.) Track record and willingness to do what is necessary to succeed. I think I can offer these skills to Rally, and I would love to be part of the process of onboarding other creators.\n\nRainRaith\nHello, my name is Jacqueline, mainly known as RainRaith on the forum and Discord! I have been an active member of this community since early February and as someone who is not a developer or marketing specialist, it is my hope that being a member of this review council will allow me to contribute to this community as best as I can. My passion in the creator space has mainly resided in the streaming community where I moderate and interact with many small-time streamers; this is in addition to my professional experience in the biochemical research field, both of which are experiences I aim to utilize in this position. On a personal note, I am keenly interested in the flourishing of inclusivity and diversity in this novel and innovative space, and I would love to be allowed to bring the unique perspective I have to Rally\u2019s review process.\n\nSIXYmofo\nAs many of you have seen from my input on the forums, I have pushed for this type of process as it will free up time for the team to focus building the dream.  When I vote on a creator,  I take a deep dive before I cast my vote.   This has helped me see some of the positives/negatives of our recent selections.   My background is building teams,  Defi enthusiast and a true believer in Rally.   I hope I can count on your vote to be one of the 3 selected.      \n\nRolf\nRolf is a member of Metacartel Venture DAO, a community by, of, and for builders in crypto. He also runs Numomo, one of the world's first Creative NFT Agencies. Rolf previously co-founded several token ventures that raised significant funding, including Savvy, a blockchain robo-advisor, and Keyless, which enables secure log-ins without a password. Rolf holds a PhD from INSEAD, where he wrote his PhD dissertation on valuing tokens.\n\nAngel#3191\nMy name is Angelica Dunkley. I am an investor of the platform, a liquidity provider on Uniswap and a frequent member to your Discord/forums. I have been a HUGE fan of social tokens since 2017 when I was first introduced to a blockchain company their aim was to give the ordinary individual a token where they can to interact with fans/community quite similar to what the Rally team are doing. I recently discovered Rally and I want to be involved more than buying the Rally token. I do not have the typical technology background, my background is Law and I am investor of bitcoin and Ethereum since 2017. I am based in western Canada and would also love to spread the word of Rally to Canadians at large.\n\nArtAboveReality\nBadir McCleary is an independent consultant. He holds an M.A. in Arts Business from Sotheby\u2019s Institute of Art (Los Angeles/London) where he focused on creating art markets and with an undergraduate degree in Internet Computing from Cabrini University focusing on e-commerce and digital trends. Badir enjoys working with artists and consider them crucial to informing his practice. Having extensive contemporary art history knowledge and experience, Badir is able to tackle large projects with confidence, protecting and tracking deliverables and ensuring high-level success for clients. \n\nPhelpsGG\nI\u2019m interested in helping identify creators that will be good ambassadors of the rally platform. \n\nMbeezy\nI am a marketing professional with over 7 years of experience and I have been involved with the Rally community since November 2020. I've applied for marketing positions within Rally and stay up to date in Discord and social channels. I am a strong believer in Rally and the Creators and would be honored to have any position within the Rally team working with like minded individuals in this new space. I greatly appreciate your consideration. \n\nGary Henderson ($GARY coin)\nGary Henderson is the creator behind Gary.club and the $GARY coin!  Over the past several years he's helped creators like Lewis Howes, Jeff Walker, Gabby Bernstein, Michael Hyatt, Dr Axe and many others build their creator economy!  Gary's currently writing a book about using the social audio app Clubhouse to build your Creator Economy!\n\nChaosed\nIn early March I wrote a detailed analysis of Rally that was well-received by Kevin Chou. I have a thorough understanding of social media, I recently started a YouTube channel called Bytesize Finance, I've streamed on Twitch, frequent Twitter & Instagram and my girlfriend is -deep- into TikTok. On top of that, my understanding of Rally is rock solid especially in terms of tokenomics. I've been involved in the crypto space for nearly six years writing reviews, analyzing technological developments and taking positions in potentially disruptive projects. \n\nJeppe_HS\nI am a firm believer in Rally and an early adopter. I have taken interest due to Nicholena and have explored Rally for months now. Recently I found very inspiring creators through Rally, and I feel it is important to keep the balance for Rally and protect the brand from any creators we would not want on the platform. I am very analytic, thorough and always like to help people get set up, answer questions and be someone who can be relied on.\n\nBigsc\nI\u2019ve sat as a trustee on various boards for pensions and health and welfare. I\u2019ve participated on many votes factoring in all relevant information at hand. I have a sound voice and am fair. I sit at the age range between boomers, millennials and Gen Z, where I can understand and relate to different types of creators and their work.\n\nAlberts#6012\nMy name is Zachary Alberts and I am a manufacturing Analyst at Georgia-Pacific (Koch Industries). Georgia pacific has instilled Market-Based Management in me, which is a culture that enables organizations to succeed in the long term by applying principles that allow free societies to prosper. I would be honored to apply the same principles to the Rally community in the form of a creator Review council member. My education is listed on my LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/zalberts/\n\nGrandMarquis\nI've been an active contributor to the Rally community since its inception. I'm the most active writer on the discourse forums, #1 across all categories. I work hard to think about ways that Rally can better serve creators and their fans, even reaching out directly to creators to better understand their needs. I'd gratefully serve the community of creators and rly holders as part of the council in this role.\n\nhammy#6924\nFundamentally, Rally is about helping creators grow and helping bring their audiences alongside them. However, the existence of this council is based on the fact that not all creators have the same community that Rally strives to assist. As someone who was born in the 2000s, I have a strong intuition about a lot of creators that aim to appeal to the younger generation (I use TikTok regularly, for example). My being part of the Creator Review Council exists primarily in being an alternate viewpoint, a voice for those that make up the majority of the community, but don't have as powerful of a voice.\n\nPilotVietnam\nLong time member with non-biased insight on how the Creator process works, and the tools they require to be successful creators.\n\nMadMikeBLVD#8154\nI'm a network engineer, solutions architect by trade. I am a long term BTC/ETC Mine operator. ETH 2.0 stalker. I am holding, using, promoting the use of creator coins and UNI RLY/ETH staking.\n\nJustin Finkelstein\nI believe Creator Coins are the future of economic transactions for people who create work that does not fit into a tiny box. I am most excited about helping creators who do not have large audiences and intend to have a coin myself. I was introduced to to Rally about a month ago through the CMO launch. I want to be part of this process to help accelerate and support new creators.", "choices": ["Vooka", "Matt MacDonald", "RainRaith", "SIXYmofo", "Rolf", "Angel#3191", "ArtAboveReality", "PhelpsGG",
