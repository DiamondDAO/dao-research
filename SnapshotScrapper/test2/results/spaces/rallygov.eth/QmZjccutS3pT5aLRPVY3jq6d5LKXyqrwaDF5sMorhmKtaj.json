Program to be funded by a $RLY grant from the Creator, Brand and Community Partnerships pool.\n\nPurpose\nRequest an allotment of 250,000 $RLY from the Creator, Brand and Community Partnerships pool, to be sent to community administrator wallets for the purposes of 1) a voting rewards program, and 2) general community awards.\n\nSummary\nDue to the current tension between using $RLY to participate in either liquidity mining or Snapshot voting, but not both, we\u2019re proposing a voting rewards program:\n \n-Weekly max of 25,000 $RLY reward allocation distributed to all voters based on % of $RLY voting power for the week\n-Eligibility requirements  - passed proposals only, minimum of 50 $RLY voting power, and a cap of 1,000 $RLY per address \n-Unused $RLY for the week to be rolled over to a future week\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019re proposing a smaller, discretionary pool for awarding notable community activity in the areas of moderation, BD, and community tooling. \n\nOf the 250,000 $RLY grant, 200,000 $RLY would be allocated to voting rewards and 50,000 $RLY for the general community awards.  There is no specific time duration for these rewards programs but we initially estimate that they will run for at least 8 weeks.\n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\n\nDeploy $RLY from the Creator, Brand and Community Partnerships pool to two separate wallets: \n-Voting Rewards (200,000 $RLY) - [address]\n-General Community Rewards (50,000 $RLY) - [address]\n\nEstablish the following authority for these administrators:\n-Access and control $RLY allocated to the program, with the authorization to grant these funds for appropriate rewards \n-Design any sub-programs or initiatives relevant to support the proposed rewards programs based on community feedback \n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1603929600, "end": 1604102400, "snapshot": "11147990", "state": "closed", "author": "0x893D2E776F21143354123241bC1DC237C47BC3fC", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
