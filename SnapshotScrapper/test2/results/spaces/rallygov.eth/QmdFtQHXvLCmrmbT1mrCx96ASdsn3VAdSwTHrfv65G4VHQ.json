{"id": "QmdFtQHXvLCmrmbT1mrCx96ASdsn3VAdSwTHrfv65G4VHQ", "title": "Developer Grant Proposal - Bonfire & Begin Work on RallyDAO", "body": "Bonfire has been an engaged member of the Rally developer community for months. Matt Alston and Melissa Zhang are active almost daily in the Discord Developer Channel. They have shown real commitment to building Bonfire with creators\u2019 needs in mind, and they have amazing and relevant backgrounds from Coinbase and Uber in engineering and product.\n\nThis proposal is designed to reward the first fulltime, outside venture funded business building on top of Rally Network and accelerate their work. The PR and communication of this grant will be designed to bring other developers into the ecosystem by giving investors further confidence that their capital will be amplified by the community as we grow the early ecosystem.\n\nHere\u2019s a demo video for their product that is live already:\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/fcabe360eace49bfbc87e8e8c12ac409\n\nThe Discourse thread where this proposal has been actively debated is found at:\nhttps://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104\n\nThe team's published roadmap is here:\nhttps://www.notion.so/31e4f8e2e88b4541a20950398bc87387?v=f5bffb5096924e44b334d665ebdde7a4\n\nThe proposal is for 500K $RLY tokens with a 6 month linear vest.  \n\nThere are well argued pros/cons of this proposal that can be found here:\nPros mentioned:\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/2\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/8\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/15\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/16\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/22\n\nCons mentioned:\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/21\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/5\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/5\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/15\n\nIt's noted that there are many quite reasonable requests to add more structure, KPI or milestone-based funding mechanisms, reporting or reduced proposal share. Taking into consideration the lack of a DAO organization to run administrative duties, this proposal adds a 6 month vesting period that is easy to administer and mitigates (mildly) some of the issues discussed.\n\nThis proposal vote does not approve a proper RallyDAO, but instead will kick off work aligned with other progressive decentralization work the initial development team is working on. The RallyDAO would empower the community further to set these matters with more effective governance tools that have come to market since the Rally launch.\n\nWe look forward to RLY token holders' vote on this matter.\n\n\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1625702400, "end": 1625961600, "snapshot": "12781398", "state": "closed", "author": "0x36aaf8A503B145F90F71C93F901049359b880Abc", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmewFBQNPbBQ4afprZL9BYNwLxhoj51kYt5mJG1Kcw8E1x", "voter": "0x7721F140C2968D5C639A9B40a1e6CA48a9b7c41D", "created": 1625930693, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc5EzM68U938rKHJw4TH96etJYBLXLCAVjNUsrfVM9avZ", "voter": "0xBAfe6495E9BCBB78F3534a60980c3AaDbA74157B", "created": 1625921688, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdYwCHPSqn8ohYZ45WAyK88xu5ABsYeB1Tcv4pbka9Ek6", "voter": "0x3f3B4c780dCFC39B24B0d09b1f1f1cF133b733D5", "created": 1625905876, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTxyp2QnX4HGgaREf7MiNnuzyE389Nno21C2dFGcj4NDD", "voter": "0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2", "created": 1625855050, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbx4fCXL5pemuFUArwPfQNcDZewumAda4PQseUoQb2Y28", "voter": "0x34D6508B607Af072858E64c65cEd6e7993225E32", "created": 1625854830, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQbbkwHTUzm2sNLX2ypweuXX5HNsJyCRwNPhhn6zuEMdJ", "voter": "0x671813687Ef1C4F0Dcccd6940880b0CB790364ad", "created": 1625839278, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdjV6v22ND3bFGLHEoHmw1UdDRoNmaNx2s3Wf814MaHwJ", "voter": "0xA8E1Ff73355411E30901fac537AB082e3d21716A", "created": 1625786339, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQhcEpDnnemhDk8Ar18c9hFTLCs5ZL8GJn14ZwfpY7nPW", "voter": "0x8d5237037A590A2dB531F3CfB8f42605cF306f34", "created": 1625785509, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZcABPMKKKdzEnLVJByXPJqxjyQigzK19Kt9oeEntDKGM", "voter": "0xA986289bDe73A7881179f2A899895F59F4a34bD4", "created": 1625775498, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUqcnuF6hXNyP1VCmZ4P6mMZEKu6NjXHmhqk6P1LMXwVP", "voter": "0x76f387E6cAF280f4bb0bea75a1FF08c871Fc2D1a", "created": 1625762625, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRkZaDSuLDHPjExvsvNmT47sG2L9NJZyN3DomJWhFBYpa", "voter": "0x0536E38fd228bf11a4084B78489BA684b3DBcF7B", "created": 1625732024, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
