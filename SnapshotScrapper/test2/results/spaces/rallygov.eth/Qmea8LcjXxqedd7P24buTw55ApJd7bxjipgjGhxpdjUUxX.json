The benefit of keeping the bar high is that it keeps out bad actors from the network. The downside is that it limits the reach and awareness levels of Rally.\n\nIt might seem favorable to the community to let everyone in, but this will make it more difficult to amend the Registry later on. I recommend keeping the bar high to draw in the highest quality of creators to Rally. This will also let us focus on the growth of individual creators on the network and study how they\u2019re using their Creator Coin.\n\nProposal: We should increase the quorum of $RLY to get accepted into the Rally Registry to minimum 50,000 $RLY. This will encourage more creators to be aware of the votes and also have them campaign for votes with $RLY holders.\n\nYes = Creator must have at least 50K yes votes AND be majority to be accepted\n\nNo = No change to the Rally Registry\n\nDiscourse discussion: https://forum.rally.io/t/increasing-quorum-for-rally-registry/68", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1603393200, "end": 1603566000, "snapshot": "11107971", "state": "closed", "author": "0x565B93a15d38aCD79c120b15432D21E21eD274d6", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
