Matt (band lead) streams regularly to their devout following and runs a solid community through his discord server focused on fun and connection via music. For Rally, the most exciting part about this creator is their enthusiasm for the platform, and willingness to lean into driving transactional use cases with exclusive access for coinholders. \n\nUsecases: The Classic Crime will employ the following use cases\n\n1 - Distribution of Gift Coin: Rewards for existing monthly subscribers in their Discord server, and giveaways through group party games like Jack Box and other browser-based multiplayer titles.\n2 - Incentives for HODLers: An added \"Coinholder\" Role and badge with some extra privileges like access to the private holder channel. In that channel Matt will have two exclusive streams monthly with music/viewing and just straight up hangs/AMA.\n3 - Transaction Commitments: The Classic Crime will sell handwritten lyrics and mystery boxes with their coin (last year they sold 100 mystery boxes at $100 ea in 1 week). Matt also plans to sell acoustic recordings from streams and unreleased sessions as an album (potentially exclusively via their CC). Matt will also provide song reviews/feedback in exchange for coins on stream and within Discord.\n\nCommunity Treasury Grant: $300\n\nA 'yes' vote will approve The Classic Crimes for the platform with a $300 gift coin grant from the treasury.\n\nA 'no' vote will decline this creator coin.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1612927800, "end": 1613100600, "snapshot": "11826184", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5ea400d06Afe7aebae54216aDfD7a4bF5f15F993", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUXsS69sQJMvdeaRQAAjJNbWctNCJmnVZFsn9NrSLaeCK", "voter": "0x562Cc90d95a15BDe25F8d2D4b4358F8588cd59f9", "created": 1613005854, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbqmWEnp6JBGAPjX9ypnjLPewWboBbo17CrzkX8wYnXNV", "voter": "0x76f387E6cAF280f4bb0bea75a1FF08c871Fc2D1a", "created": 1612977590, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaZgBe2g2eNXNqo3z3r2bYinPHGQL9ZQJ9NQe9WTFbvPn", "voter": "0x34D6508B607Af072858E64c65cEd6e7993225E32", "created": 1612971777, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXinXyaYEpfxsNT2SthQKsF93UPjJ1DNHznHHTFynKYbN", "voter": "0x5714Bd32195126EaeB3b5B5265420f0eA7886C79", "created": 1612961149, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmURB1z9ERfxQmrDcxwb5NNRqgXr9mwuuY3LQTCW3o4UW2", "voter": "0xADdC94AD74251792E52A4851591665ea0E8f7389", "created": 1612939906, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme5xQigQZTyXzwjh23gmzJiLCNEauHKfBqvAqCHyZJ7QA", "voter": "0xb51b62028bDe4d3a9402bF402d3b7a1eA30c02fe", "created": 1612938734, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbX9fNbo8AuQAr6is9op6PHLznrY7Ec7AsxWCYszEk52x", "voter": "0xE2cC777D59b4D354FF1D55aDd7579726d04430C0", "created": 1612938216, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYkjAVPnkAqzqPf6AWSnAcDJvVkHyrxXKzC7v8eEtnmqM", "voter": "0x893D2E776F21143354123241bC1DC237C47BC3fC", "created": 1612935385, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmdd8HGjENwBwXzyF5YMbw2xxzTrRuRATL6PYiaF9sPe6D", "voter": "0x3637d7F6041D73917017e5d3E2259473215ecf6f", "created": 1612935156, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaPZ5m4bqLkEZVtdc3CP3FpQA9cYJZjF4zVtmdFCajhCR", "voter": "0xa156008f7D6F2DC99d91B671Ed1C986D968BF6E2", "created": 1612934374, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
