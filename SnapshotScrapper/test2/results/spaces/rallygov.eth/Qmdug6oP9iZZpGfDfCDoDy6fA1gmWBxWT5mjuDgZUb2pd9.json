Gating content using Creator Coins allows creators to reward their top token holders with exclusive content, as well as generate more demand for their coins.\n\nFor full discussion, please review the Discourse forum posts here: https://forum.rally.io/t/proposal-gate-content-using-any-rally-coin/882\n\n**Background:**\n\nMintGate would like to propose the following budget for their development and implementation of a widget and token gating API to enable creators to use Creator Coins to gate their content:\n\nAdditional testing and research of OAuth:\n*8 hours * $100 = $800.*\n\nImplementation of the widget (for creators to add to their websites):\n*40 hours * $100 = $4,000*\n\nImplementation of the the token gating API:\n*60 hours * $100 = $6,000*\n\nTesting and troubleshooting\n*10 hours * $100 = $1,000*\n\n*Total budget: $11,800*\n\nMintGate would like to provide each creator with two free token gated links. Any creator who creates more than two token gated links has the option to choose either: 1) a monthly subscription for $25 worth of their Creator Coin a month for an unlimited number of links and analytics, or 2) $5 worth of their Creator Coin for a one-time purchase of one link that is valid for a year.\n\nCreators who want to access the APIs directly on their personal sites and projects will be billed directly. Creators and community devs can use the API for free up to one link and an additional $5 to $10 per additional link.\n  \n**Proposal**\nThis proposal will grant MintGate $11,800 in $RLY from the previously allocated $RLY for developer grants and bounties to develop the creator tools described above.\n\n**A Yes vote for this proposal would approve the payment of this developer grant of $11,800 in $RLY to MintGate.**\n\n**A No vote would result in rejection of this proposal.**\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1621633500, "end": 1621806300, "snapshot": "12480175", "state": "closed", "author": "0xADdC94AD74251792E52A4851591665ea0E8f7389", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTE65uEoJp7G2NZ9ceQ3YBMmgL78LGtYpQfH3yMnmPAK4", "voter": "0xb51b62028bDe4d3a9402bF402d3b7a1eA30c02fe", "created": 1621738964, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdGCktM5uBJcZpWJjGKEo7LnTiUyh22cEAMTjjfwvbgC9", "voter": "0x9D9c5583f5C1f22749072fbA4Fc2093abFcd524A", "created": 1621719594, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaeJXkpsv5nAqRX28pdoRxd1wyihn8us64USeHshHqdMP", "voter": "0xE2cC777D59b4D354FF1D55aDd7579726d04430C0", "created": 1621716889, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbT2BiqAZNd48JhmMs8M6tQ4ebyDkEprBWXADQkL8wt39", "voter": "0x7721F140C2968D5C639A9B40a1e6CA48a9b7c41D", "created": 1621715993, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ3uStHjToXFPwnhkRD8ivuuxs3R16MqwMKgjJeQWSaWd", "voter": "0x0e52B9228F901b393C182a5C30f2a10dB2Ae247b", "created": 1621715450, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYoF1qQ9t8FN9vznZLUtEMWzTV2eNSwWTwqVkRHUN7sxA", "voter": "0xccda0716ec78202812c7F5947e8e801461aC38C4", "created": 1621713430, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVmSzeNWNLC4eqwMR77U7rSFexU6NB3PVdCeWz3G25JVq", "voter": "0x16cB461d27a84f3B096E4950458f8828347D0A26", "created": 1621688303, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbsDN3wfNQU8bquYMmcKEvzT7biNFynjfrgSsUs85aQ82", "voter": "0x3637d7F6041D73917017e5d3E2259473215ecf6f", "created": 1621668020, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSRjAS6LhQkQMfaxyhmpPz5oHeKn3TD1xtDQ5DTaHgjtq", "voter": "0xf19192062C93887D65F6dFFffdAe2E7975FEb1Ea", "created": 1621640611, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXm5VbrQTWYEodVWc2Ppsm4UyrMHZBjoB5ArW42kbvbif", "voter": "0xEe2319094bBB69c3DF5f1d2E5Ef62fD2F20030a1", "created": 1621634094, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
