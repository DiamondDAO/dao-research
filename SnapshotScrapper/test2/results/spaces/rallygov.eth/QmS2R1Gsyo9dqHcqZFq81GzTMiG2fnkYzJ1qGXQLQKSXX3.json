The core motivations for YDVs were:\n\n - Introduce the Rally project to the Ethereum DeFi community\n - Provide a fair distribution mechanism to start getting $RLY in the hands of contributing community members\n - Enable users to earn $RLY through active participation in the Rally Network\n - Create a sustainable way in which contributors could support building a community treasury without taking on significant capital risk\n\nYDVs have largely performed as expected to date but the risk profile seems to be changing. We chose Yearn vaults for the yield delegation and $RLY distribution strategy because of the quality of their engineering team, the stability of their protocol, and our understanding of the level of risk associated with their yield generating strategies. \n\nAs Yearn builds forward on their vaults and starts migrating to their v2 design, this risk profile starts to change substantially. The Yearn v2 design allows for more rapid iteration on strategies, dynamic rebalancing within a single vault in order to support multiple strategies simultaneously, and a general move towards capital efficiency and leverage possibilities. All of these are fantastic ideas and should continue to position Yearn as a leader in the DeFi space. However, they all also increase the risk profile of Yearn vaults in a way that makes them less compatible with the motivations behind the introduction of YDVs. And this is all exacerbated by the fact that one of the seemingly minor modifications supporting the v2 transition opened the door to an exploit of one of Yearn\u2019s v1 vaults (https://www.coindesk.com/yearn-finance-dai-vault-exploit).\n\nPerhaps most importantly, we no longer need to continue funding the treasury through YDVs as we conclude the first part of the Rally community fundraise (https://forum.rally.io/t/community-treasury-fundraise-update-and-next-steps/378/).\n \n**Proposal**\n - Set all Yield Delegating Vault rewards to 0 $RLY (https://vaults.rally.io/vaults), and return the full underlying yearn vault interest to the capital contributor\n - Reallocate the current Pool 6 rewards for Curve 3pool LPs to the Pool 1 Uniswap Pool LP reward (https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x27fd0857f0ef224097001e87e61026e39e1b04d1/), increasing the Uniswap LP Rewards by roughly 15% \n \n**A Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:**\nApproval of the above terms to enable the core development team to set YDV rewards to 0 and reallocate Liquidity Mining Rewards to the Uniswap LP Pool \n \n**A No vote would result in rejection of these terms.**\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1613695500, "end": 1613868300, "snapshot": "11884089", "state": "closed", "author": "0xADdC94AD74251792E52A4851591665ea0E8f7389", "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth", "name": "Rally"}, "votes": 19, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRyg7eCCr7BHoURkiC413R3qJjP5QDj2ymmt9DGnMY2jR", "voter": "0x17d44a8fD2b87FB73A76898dd1F41DB57e265527", "created": 1613857453, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSSkKRwvihBR3DZ1umbuH1cjFjy4yHpFJ4DBJ4GJHtznH", "voter": "0x4f2ea13c2E7D8b8f51f440Bdf4fA4FBB48d0c944", "created": 1613857442, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNvY8YCP35MYPLPiwmz74z8NUQFna6UpVicZC2RDoLjNV", "voter": "0x97d524A5d50EAeED87d09B5116736aCD6a9c6458", "created": 1613857430, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTY2cEfwt68oaVJBw8cVfT7grRc6Esu9nJcxgZ2fS1LoC", "voter": "0x9A2a14835Bf43F8f6Dea84424D786F74146b7714", "created": 1613857418, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUrcYYCSqGA7wuexRHS7FVnK44x3pjoNHHcejk2EhFZac", "voter": "0xfeb2B87e417f82871257c6D4726410f6AbE25681", "created": 1613857405, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXfozZiG2gQMr8tgNXx7xZBK2h9386RDGRY99RvepfJ1j", "voter": "0x13F6b636C1Ea91D2fEed6f8c42874121b9744060", "created": 1613857394, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX1aDCjefVKfESrpJz1Tuq5XPv7Ktzm48kt65LouEvavf", "voter": "0x4C73bF6CE4Fa4E1Dc84A08a4ed7daFbE60e8768A", "created": 1613857384, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPmeEacPbf1dBtzykPdSpkGoRWoV34DgKusJuNHYp8Nom", "voter": "0x99655e21288c01465191aFa0e4629d012C39a2db", "created": 1613798317, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUGtCFw2E7yKRrX5VqxawfY83JHephwxDb9M2TCzWS947", "voter": "0x57A2Afd5795478d129ddc644D5BDb9fa4810eE13", "created": 1613765454, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYtkTXaGyGcARs6MhyD8uce1w7UPGbpfnCW3zby4TsGup", "voter": "0xb51b62028bDe4d3a9402bF402d3b7a1eA30c02fe", "created": 1613756143, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQdH71wwFpXQutkpcsFt5Dt6FRkJAwQFHdkrWMtYECgq9", "voter": "0x893D2E776F21143354123241bC1DC237C47BC3fC", "created": 1613755067, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSsyzU5n9vcNeeUTbxN5KVCJucpyq84zaX7T8ZLUZM2Sn", "voter": "0x5ea400d06Afe7aebae54216aDfD7a4bF5f15F993", "created": 1613754817, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUujLoytnB7jKqm5gVDzkA25F9PDGz6dij3GiwLXb4b9K", "voter": "0x34D6508B607Af072858E64c65cEd6e7993225E32", "created": 1613743168, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZq3ys4St64Q8Ty5fVqnGDfzukZzZMUAsattfUdEVCS3x", "voter": "0xaB2B4d715F8130Fc193D0B54f1A76675d004C539", "created": 1613739803, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYyMZPRu6tNb5mnLGTHnYeWpmzDWWsQbxMD7wCwmmC21f", "voter": "0xccda0716ec78202812c7F5947e8e801461aC38C4", "created": 1613737251, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQhHgBtj6opG5szBqgWrGUvHVA12qvK1sDEMYHgtVrDZC", "voter": "0x3637d7F6041D73917017e5d3E2259473215ecf6f", "created": 1613721204, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd9H9rXLZ87wXiCyCy6D6jS2sNZ56sLWooWNGUEauPX5j", "voter": "0xE2cC777D59b4D354FF1D55aDd7579726d04430C0", "created": 1613699228, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXwKYxvw1EkUnsi32ueue9UDFtdN8U75FdJzqFrdftEoq", "voter": "0x76f387E6cAF280f4bb0bea75a1FF08c871Fc2D1a", "created": 1613698880, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb7w1eEdoKwzUyB3GA83hdnfnMVku3ppDH9uQMjmFMmwf", "voter": "0x3f3B4c780dCFC39B24B0d09b1f1f1cF133b733D5", "created": 1613697527, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rallygov.eth"}}]}
