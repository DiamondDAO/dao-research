{"id": "QmZAXoTxXmTy28tmaaMu7Zvz3uJfRCTA2VxSDLgUjwYSnG", "title": "{GODPROP #4} Yomopu Plan", "body": "Here's an old tale from the Deliland Archives. \n\nMeandering along a rocky road alongside Lake Lauren, a young chap by the name of Ygar Skorgi stumbled across a patch of wild yomopu. It smelled so delicious... pungent of course, but sweet when savored long enough... Was it a fruit? No. Ygar lifted it up to his face to get a better look. \n\nBut looking was not enough. And the smell... was it salty as well? \n\nHis first bite was like being smacked by the Great One themself. He gathered as much yomopu as he could hold an ran back to town.\nHe added it to every recipe. Yomopu meatloaf, yomopu sourdough.. you name it, yomopu made it better.\nNot before long the entire town could not stop eating yomopu.\nAt first, gathering yomopu was difficult. But Ygar's friend was hard at work finding new ways to search it out.\n\nThese are their findings:\n\n\n# Proposal to add New Pools and Fee Tiers to Yomopu\n\nIf this proposal passes, the following classification will be unchangeable until a new proposal is passed specifically for the purpose of modifying it.\n\nThe classification is important, because each group defines a Fee Tier: deposit fee and allocation points will be the same for each pool in the group.\n\n# The Classification\n\nEcosystem Core Farmables (ECF)\n\n1. SPIRIT\n2. BOO\n3. ORI\n4. WAKA\n5. BRUSH\n6. TOMB\n\nEcosystem HODL (EH)\n\n1. ZOO\n2. ECHO\n3. AURORA\n4. YORO\n5. BUTT\n6. GRIM\n7. JUST\n8. NIPS\n9. CASPER\n10. Steak\n11. fUSD\n12. ifUSD \n\nEcosystem Farmables (EF)\n\n1. CHAD\n2. CATNIP\n3. SHIT\n\nCore Cryptos (CC)\n\n1. DAI\n2. ETH\n3. FTM\n4. BTC\n\nDefi Blue Chip (DBC)\n\n1. CURVE\n2. LINK\n3. CREAM\n4. SUSHI\n5. YFI\n6. AAVE\n7. BAND\n\nShould this proposal pass, all pools on the list will be eligible to add to Yomopu. They will require separate proposals requesting they be added.\n\nIf you vote yes on this proposal, then you must select a Fee Structure. Again, this is something that can be changed through proposal, but only for an entire group.\n\n# Fees and Allocation Points\n\nFor reference, the allocation points for Yomopu and DAI are both 1.\nThe DAI pool has a deposit fee of 0.4%.\n\n# Option 1 - Benefits Farmers the Most\n\n1. ECF : 0.1% / 1\n2. EH : 0.3% / 1\n3. EF : 0.1% / 1\n4. CC : 1% / 0.25\n5. DBC : 1% / 0.5\n\nWhen someone deposits a farmable into yomopu, they are deciding to forego compounding their earnings into their initial position, in order to earn yomopu. \nConsidering the assets in ECF & EF, this would hopefully help decrease selling pressure across the ecosystem. \nIt also benefits farmers more than hodlers. \nSimilarly, most of the assets in EH are also used to farm on Fantom. \nBecause they are less susceptible to price decline, we require a slightly higher deposit fee.\nCC and DBC are given increased deposit fees. CC assets earn at 1/4 the base rate, DBC assets at 1/2.\nThis should prevent non-fantom maxis from dumping there blue chips and eth/btc into yomopu. \n\n# Option 2 - Benefits HODLers the Most\n\n1. ECF : 0.2% / 1\n2. EH : 0.2% / 1\n3. EF : 0.2% / 1\n4. CC : 1% / 0.25\n5. DBC : 1% / 0.5\n\nThis option is the same as Option 1, but with reduced fees for assets in group EH, and increased fees for assets in ECF & EF.\n\n# Option 3 - Benefits Whales the Most\n\n1. ECF : 0.3% / 1\n2. EH : 0.3% / 1\n3. EF : 0.3% / 1\n4. CC : 0.5% / 0.25\n5. DBC : 0.4% / 0.5\n\nThis option increases ECF, EH, & EF asset deposit fees to 0.3%; it reduces the CC deposit fee to 0.5% and DBC deposit fee to 0.4%. The downside to this option is that humble farmers will have a more difficult time earning Yomopu than whales with lots of Blue Chips.\n\n# Option 4 - Benefits the DAO\n\n1. ECF : 0.1% / 1\n2. EH : 0.1% / 1\n3. EF : 0.1% / 1\n4. CC : 4% / 1\n5. DBC : 3% / 1\n\nIn option 4, all ECF, EH, & EF assets will have the lowest fee (0.1%); but, the allocation points to CC and DBC are brought to the same level as everything else, and the deposit fees are significantly higher than the prior options. This option would bring maximal value to the DAO.\n\nPSA: All deposit fees will be deposited into Curve or Cream until proposals pass determining the allocation of funds.
