Under the conditions and in the manner of rule #3, universe level governance can be switched from ECHO to the universe's Core Token. \u200b( read more https://app.gitbook.com/@maxusog/s/maxus-multiverse/ )\n\n3. If a user passes a proposal through the DAO, using ECHO, and adhering to all other rules laid out through official proposals, the Core Token for that universe can be made to act as voting power for matters regarding that universe's projects.\n\n4. #3 is reversible through the same process (using ECHO).\n\n5. No tokens other than the Core Tokens can be made the governance token of the DAO or any universe.\n\n6. All ownership of chef contracts is not a subject of DAO governance, until the DAO has matured. If we have more than 100 people voting, on average, for a month straight, contract ownership can become a topic of discussion. Ownership will never be transferable to anyone but myself, to a smart contract (for automated governance in the future), or to the dead address.\n\n7. Fees and profits cannot be requested to be transferred to any individual (including myself). They can only be used for in-universe value generation, or to farm assets, which then will only be able to be used for in-universe value generation. This can only be done by via proposal.\n\n8. Acres pools cannot be added with allocation point amounts that do not already exist.\n\nIf you vote yes, and this proposal passes, then all of these rules will become official.\n( I'll smack you across the mouth if you vote no. I promise all of these rules are to make sure this works. )\n\nAlso, some pork: Whether or not the proposal preceding this passes, it is { GODPROP #8 }.\n\nAdd the { GODPROP #N } to your proposals from now on if they are meant to be official.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1627113600, "end": 1627146000, "snapshot": "12810334", "state": "closed", "author": "0x8DE3c3891268502F77DB7E876d727257DEc0F852", "space": {"id": "farmgod.eth", "name": "Farmgod DAO"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNiaWwdJQJD2NeeYv64N7GVb4Kq2gZXstvZRErxTF6Zvb", "voter": "0xfF1e908e05B4BE5E98dd1177FC1b7A39df233d93", "created": 1627142666, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "farmgod.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWZ5y4vpuGaFA92CFWQFz32eDUeSXekKxDtcCRnb6Fuag", "voter": "0x2996d82Fb798A98C9ce18DC9528e0f88E3871e86", "created": 1627130233, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "farmgod.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmdqp6Th1M1sbhWCQKtR5AyehXRgGdg3G4UosXGit9rBzk", "voter": "0x8DE3c3891268502F77DB7E876d727257DEc0F852", "created": 1627114168, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "farmgod.eth"}}]}
