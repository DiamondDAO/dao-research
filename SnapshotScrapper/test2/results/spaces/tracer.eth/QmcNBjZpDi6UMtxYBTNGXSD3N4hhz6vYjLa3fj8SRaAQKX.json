{"id": "QmcNBjZpDi6UMtxYBTNGXSD3N4hhz6vYjLa3fj8SRaAQKX", "title": "Proposal #25: Code 423n4 (Arena) Audit - Bug Bounty #2", "body": "\n# Summary\n\nDiscourse link: [**here**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/code-423n4-arena-audit-bug-bounty-2/555)\n\n\nThis proposal is for the purpose of engaging Code Arena (Code 423n4) to audit the **Tracer Perpetual Pools contracts** as a bug bounty. Code 423n4 offer a \u201ccommunity-driven approach to competitive smart contract audits\u201d. They have also previously provided a bug bounty audit for **Tracer\u2019s Perpetual Swaps contracts** as per the  [**EOI, operations post**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/code-423n4-audit-operations/278) and the reimbursement [**proposal**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-12-update-to-myceliums-offer/316). In addition to Sigma Prime\u2019s audit, this initiative accords with Tracer\u2019s vision for deploying impenetrable smart contracts.\n\nThe audit is running for a total period of one week starting from 6/10/21 - 2:39pm UTC time. Prior to the audit, everyone wishing to participate in the audit should join the **C4 Discord channel** to register their address as per the documentation here: [**Become a Code 423n4 Warden**](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/wardens). View the countdown for the Tracer contest to begin here: [**Code 423n4**](https://code423n4.com/). There will be a total of **$30,000 USDC** & **$20,000** (USDC equivalent) TCR offered in the prize pool for bugs found in the Tracer Perpetual Pools contracts as per the criteria here: [**Judging Criteria 1.**](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/wardens/judging-criteria).\n\nPlease share with anyone who would be interested in auditing the Tracer contracts in return for USDC.\n\nMycelium has already paid the required $30,000 USDC for the bug bounty. If successful this proposal will action to have Mycelium reimbursed by Tracer DAO.\n\n\n# Growth Fund Allocation\n\n\nIncluded in this proposal is a **$20,000.00** (USDC equivalent) **TCR** payment for winners of the bug bounty. As per the [**Tracer Growth Fund proposal**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385), the bug bounty TCR payment sits within the remit of initiative 1 within Deliverables as a Service Provider:\n\n  1. 80,000,000 TCR (8%) new Service Providers and contractors and employees of existing Service Providers.\n\nMycelium has already paid the required $20,000.00 (USDC equivalent) TCR payment for the bug bounty. Once the Growth Fund is live, the decision to reimburse Mycelium sits within the remit of the Growth Fund Managers. Thus, if this current proposal is successful, it will only trigger the reimbursement of $30,000.00 USDC to Mycelium.\n\n\n# Remuneration\n\nFor the provision of these services, the following remuneration package is proposed:\n\n  1. $30,000 USDC (or equivalent) to reimburse Mycelium for the bounty award pool.\n\n\n# Deliverables\n\n\nIf engaged by this DAO proposal to provide the services described in this Offer to the DAO, Code 423n4 will commit to provide the following deliverables:\n\n  1. An Audit of the core Tracer Protocol perpetual pools codebase at [**https://github.com/tracer-protocol/perpetual-pools-contracts**]( https://github.com/tracer-protocol/perpetual-pools-contracts)\n\nThis audit will be community driven and aim to locate bugs, exploits and security concerns throughout the protocol code.\n\n\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n  1. Code 423n4 acknowledges that, if engaged, its engagement can be varied by future proposals.\n  2. Code 423n4 expects that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the deliverables specified above.\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n  1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n  2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nCode 423n4 wishes to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n  1. No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n\n # Interpretation\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a proposal under the Participation Agreement, Code 423n4 may more formally document aspects of that proposal.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [**CC0**](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n", "choices": ["Accept", "Reject"], "start": 1633859100, "end": 1634031900, "snapshot": "13390077", "state": "closed", "author": "0x64ed1b023858dc329Ad0f8bC7C8389FE7e4517FE", "space": {"id": "tracer.eth", "name": "Tracer"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVLpLbsvRgo3dp5wV3grgXJH24oxSXhxuzHPNkBdvSX7o", "voter": "0x4D1271Bf27901DfCB3Fe8D67C52C907B2BB7afcA", "created": 1633994593, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeL3FDFBSad4GAA2VMZQuKaAsMtchhMFg9odznGS87Fog", "voter": "0xE962A349e5b0665c322577F0b7f3c497FDA7556F", "created": 1633964690, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcXsVjeVV8DCPsDp4SP3JozewB9FjFagvE4yfUhiRY1Hh", "voter": "0x05e92fB03d0126cEDd3a5B06020b121e8D3Ca857", "created": 1633941708, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma4vL5JRhapwuuFV4wohfDcD8sCxZuBbUwYcvCKenttXt", "voter": "0x55F4f271408F36299222d5C2ecB95D33ea1c99ee", "created": 1633940045, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNV36mStKNKTipACzUFF3J8G1j11Zrc66L3nTX8VntJ8b", "voter": "0x9B7A417Cde9D1e116958E4aaEF6c09928E0fe5BD", "created": 1633926076, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmchDYb8Kx1NDtmtA7uU7PxTTwdq4hgkp2LqrDhTvjJEBo", "voter": "0x64ed1b023858dc329Ad0f8bC7C8389FE7e4517FE", "created": 1633926049, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdvKwZbX8xqk9cW6GmX6NuDku7Rg89NKWupiG3RdJSKdf", "voter": "0xB960665D4e601063df28c9067c0d925069cf9142", "created": 1633924949, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcEBBHdSNoUM2PtnJfKA3s9dqLUdNAsq9JUNsh4VR1GXZ", "voter": "0x5eeA91e130Df8767c847d36e7139dC5Dd648bd43", "created": 1633924561, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmckMCNm4MatG5GBc11x839dvAHV63fAmBE4jo2FK4MaPh", "voter": "0x219BaD06180F4024A06C372d754E882D175Df098", "created": 1633922002, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTSEhyxZ1rcXX9Be3EYGenESh3g6jVLnbvYgjjFEvG5oH", "voter": "0x21d507A87c77A6A27E0E8284ccFD48aDda71c814", "created": 1633921194, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}]}
