Stake TOKE to vote on other projects in the upcoming C.o.R.E.2. event; and\n2. Stake TOKE in order for the Tracer DAO to effectively optimise its treasury for greater capital efficiency by earning yield on the TOKE tokens that are staked in [Tokemak.](https://www.tokemak.xyz/)\n\nTracer's experience with the first C.o.R.E. Rector event was a huge success and in turn developed strong relationships with the protocols that were in the spotlight. The C.o.R.E. event also effectively provided greater market exposure for Tracer DAO.\n\nAdditionally, it enabled the TCR token to have strong volumes of liquidity for users to seamlessly purchase TCR to become apart of the DAO and provide exit liquidity for liquidity miners currently using Tracer's Perpetual Pools financial contract with lower slippage. \n\n## Rationale\n\nTracer has acquired Toke in its treasury and now has the ability to utilise this TOKE to build a partnerships through the next round of Tokemaks C.o.R.E.2 Reactor voting. \n\n*\"TOKE staking voting will be 1:6, 1 TOKE = 6 votes (increase from the first C.o.R.E. for single asset staked TOKE)\"*\n\n[https://medium.com/tokemak/c-o-r-e-2-begins-tuesday-november-9th-f52ca43f0770](https://medium.com/tokemak/c-o-r-e-2-begins-tuesday-november-9th-f52ca43f0770)\n\nBecause of the multiplier of stake voting, Tracer's vote has the ability to increase the chances of the these protocol igniting a token reactor which will in turn build strong partnerships with the winning protocols and their community. \n\n---\n\n# Consideration\n\nTo expand the Tracer ecosystem, Tracer DAO will stake TOKE in its treasury to:\n\n1. Vote for 3 of the 45 candidates in the running for the C.o.R.E.2. Token reactor. \n2. Receive staking rewards up to 57% APR. Tracer DAO has 27,406.56 TOKE in its treasury available for stake voting (equating to 164,439.36 votes).\n\n![image|690x377](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/tracer/original/1X/592a44cce01f1d47b768c08d6e4d036326c2f68f.png)\n\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\nAn open Discourse poll will be open for members of the DAO to vote in the token of their choice for the 2nd C.o.R.E. event on Tokemak.\n\n1. The #1 voted candidate will receive 50% of the Tracers voting power;\n2. The #2 voted candidate will receive 30% of the Tracers voting power; and\n3. The #3 voted candidate will receive 20% of the Tracers voting power.\n\nOnce the poll has reached consensus, this proposal will be updated to include the top 3 tokens. The proposal may then be pushed to Snapshot to accept Tracer DAO staking TOKE in the Tokemak reactor to receive returns for staking and to vote on the tokens selected from the poll. \n\nThe results from the [Discourse poll](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-tokemak-reactor-vote-round-2/643/2) are as follows:\n1. TEMPLE (Temple DAO)\n2. SPELL (Abracadabra Money)\n3. MATIC (Polygon)\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. If this proposal is successful, it can be varied or terminated by future Proposals.\n2. TOKE tokens staked in Tokemak may be returned to the DAO via future proposal. In a case of a smart contract hack/emergency 'black swan' event, veto power is given to the Mycelium team to effectively protect the DAO by returning TOKE tokens back to the DAO.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nConflicts of interest to declare:\n\n1. No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n---\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, others may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).", "choices": ["Accept Tokemak proposal", "Reject Tokemak proposal"], "start": 1636792200, "end": 1636965000, "snapshot": "13606547", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4d834700AF7915Ca8441f486bb09268fAd7DEd1E", "space": {"id": "tracer.eth", "name": "Tracer"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xa5ffea59512a2ded4243720519d8adf298b6fe3976ba9f83b88250a651d82b80", "voter": "0xB64C462A155dBe151fA34f402C12564671eE08Cb", "created": 1636956425, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0x08209061f27678c86dc226bd7dbb0dd2d9de24821c794e2710af699aa77f62e9", "voter": "0x4D1271Bf27901DfCB3Fe8D67C52C907B2BB7afcA", "created": 1636932159, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0x949914c391fd2d174df7b2e63cbfba980f96ac9f6cdc6406cb7ea03dc4d3271e", "voter": "0x7F7F671d60D784272176B0e1c86Cc81f0DAca57f", "created": 1636900884, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0x3bdc0de5c60a9a6b95e2c1e8bee52b8e6f81a749f73267a36bef10f5cf9e9859", "voter": "0x5eeA91e130Df8767c847d36e7139dC5Dd648bd43", "created": 1636847310, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0x22947cdaf127cd208e6576e70d790ee1ced485ecd310c8c9f966490f114315f6", "voter": "0xB960665D4e601063df28c9067c0d925069cf9142", "created": 1636802936, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0x27a577166d58549814cec8e8923a4f5cf1206d6b08225c70a896449f02e1ca10", "voter": "0x4d834700AF7915Ca8441f486bb09268fAd7DEd1E", "created": 1636793435, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}]}
