I am bullish on seeing the traditional financial system replaced with more secure and reliable transactional methods that minimise counter-party risk and maximise transparency and value provided for users of the system. From what I\u2019ve seen, Tracer DAO fits this bill and I\u2019m happy to provide my time and money to work with the DAO to seek this end.\n\nI believe that I can provide great value in guiding the Tracer DAO to change the future of finance. I intend to guide Tracer DAO to build derivative contracts that will enable new digital and real word markets to be unlocked that provide meaningful ways for people to manage and take risk.\n\nFor now, you must respect my decision to preserve my identity and privacy, the Mycelium team will be able to confirm my value as a strategic advisor to Tracer DAO.\n\n**Remuneration**\nFor the provision of my diversification efforts and services, I request:\n\n- 10,000,000 TCR vested on a pro rata basis over 91 weeks, starting on the day that this proposal is executed.\n\n**Deliverables**\nIf I am engaged to provide the services described in this Proposal to the DAO, I will provide the following:\n\n- 1 hour per week of consultation to the Mycelium team.\n- $250,000 USD (half in wBTC and half in ETH), delivered upon execution of this proposal.\n\nI also commit to not be involved in any product that is a competitor to any of the Tracer Factory\u2019s products.\n\n**Variation and Termination**\n- I, Yamashita, acknowledge that, if engaged, my engagement can be varied or terminated by future Proposals. However, this termination is limited to 5,000,000 TCR which relates to my advisory efforts.\n- I expect that any engagement will be terminated if I fail to deliver in accordance with the Deliverables specified above.\n\n**Conflicts of Interest**\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n- Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n- Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nI, Yamashita, wish to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n- No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n**Interpretation**\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, I, Yamashita, may introduce more formally documented aspects of the Proposal.\n\n**Copyright Waiver**\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0 1](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).", "choices": ["Accept Yamashita's Services", "Reject Yamashita's Services"], "start": 1627974000, "end": 1628146800, "snapshot": "12950674", "state": "closed", "author": "0x27412e76f372bd30400D6883B010C50909d5258d", "space": {"id": "tracer.eth", "name": "Tracer"}, "votes": 18, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRgwgzjHAyPkD6e1XkdLBKdqzCJsEwrwDa9Hszhx8ZFT1", "voter": "0x76A84A7E932a19aFbBAB9731CEd5f2B11dD5640d", "created": 1628138044, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfFvr26bxRHbGTHpPGvzZ5n25jATAss7CC1nMJzczNG3a", "voter": "0x2E0b150ed2A12F0a5C249Ff598C4f045f96bC4b9", "created": 1628071638, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWgGXu1cLdGzWreyVU2mjLY8MH7F7DyawPTiC8mpNByfd", "voter": "0xd814B879edBc928601A48887a2953F2Ddf0e237e", "created": 1628049122, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQhXjr4SKQofA5W9yspnRmtKXQAyP6oAevroSRNEuMUvT", "voter": "0x10F3678A860E21d951ACfb775f84e5741396164b", "created": 1628045896, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZkiyDgN9xaxTvpLaqjyW267qaw815XHXieBaZMtEFnE1", "voter": "0x06187EAA4EF0891571F0a78a2DDEf0d291555E09", "created": 1628045893, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXNKs525MEE2bU4ZepAuMhrncgfgZMpDkRY2wwj95XC1k", "voter": "0x20197847A6c35Ed97F3C78CD4De862F686CbEfd6", "created": 1628045104, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP81EkXbgaZAyMnCLTQ5pmVehaKr9xddawNdnjbjDMNE4", "voter": "0x8A3Ad42D4A6159fceee4bB348Ac72152804b51Bd", "created": 1628043400, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcKWu9f7JzvJhuCQ4XtCqtwJ8D17tgx2cm9zW5v1MGoT4", "voter": "0x27412e76f372bd30400D6883B010C50909d5258d", "created": 1628041309, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfMSpfK9bqasqPRiPeQcTVz63TeB695jKCP3qAwAFJbxe", "voter": "0x9899c037866B335a4eEb59E62b4Cf77a955bb1a4", "created": 1628040308, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd2HzmhfiJZzN2RHqzZkdwwNcXWM5hEizDPkW4DPD47rs", "voter": "0x21d507A87c77A6A27E0E8284ccFD48aDda71c814", "created": 1628034757, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS6w6pGbVp6jg6spAdGvWXEHkuoqSwBibads3PBfFEPR5", "voter": "0x10464d14d27d5115A9C9D4d9Ec9C62E5C7146ad4", "created": 1628028567, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW3foTPp2ham3WpWDjbX24HjbrCHkQ5cdTNGuXgQ3nbgy", "voter": "0x219BaD06180F4024A06C372d754E882D175Df098", "created": 1628023004, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP6Fh9FpV8EXQTy31C9KKmoK4tbrGuWQZ7qDmsxXcBaAK", "voter": "0xE962A349e5b0665c322577F0b7f3c497FDA7556F", "created": 1628009501, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP45X7p9SeGi1NXA4pm1MSSDXUi338ATWUQvHKAvm2hiv", "voter": "0x05e92fB03d0126cEDd3a5B06020b121e8D3Ca857", "created": 1627998988, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTGHzuSfHRbLNBWa1imWgB5bH8kdvt8Yej4ZGNdhqVwqC", "voter": "0xaB57ad01EF6C420089C2BaC26F204A28406F73e0", "created": 1627990519, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSru3UhkvY72PUMzfuMmD814d54F99xb2hXXBhxLvC3D2", "voter": "0x3babBC5E1566DE998ffc82D73510647D835e01B6", "created": 1627983826, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQzsQ2TViuu3qd9B5RKZRfzFTa7TyeaqbgtLQytviuQFY", "voter": "0xd7988b659063352A3867979f8F35181A5835b439", "created": 1627978485, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcGqoH9g155WtwgAMTJuWXKqGigeyMuycKk6rSfChCDMA", "voter": "0x5eeA91e130Df8767c847d36e7139dC5Dd648bd43", "created": 1627974761, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}]}
