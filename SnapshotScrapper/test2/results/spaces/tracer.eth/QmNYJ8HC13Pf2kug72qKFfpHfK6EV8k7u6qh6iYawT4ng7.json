Chris Berg (Co-founder) of RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub | 0x219BaD06180F4024A06C372d754E882D175Df098 |\n\nCollectively, these parties will be referred to as the **Growth Fund Managers** or **Managers**.\n\n# Remuneration\nThe Managers will not receive any remuneration for the provision of these services.\n\nThe following tokens will be transferred to a multi-sig controlled by the Managers:\n1. 280,000,000 TCR Tokens (28% of TCR total supply) vested across the proposed distribution:\na. 80,000,000 TCR Tokens (8% of TCR total supply) vested linearly across year 1 (year 1 commencing as soon as Growth Fund is implemented); and\nb. 200,000,000 TCR Tokens (20% of TCR total supply) vested linearly across years 2-10.\n\n![Growth Fund Schedule](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/tracer/optimized/1X/29b5c442bfd5bc08fa5eae829bae1bcdb53d27de_2_690x427.png)\n\n# Deliverables\nIf this proposal succeeds, the Growth Fund Managers will commit to provide the following deliverables:\n1. A monthly update, via Discourse, including all activities conducted by the Managers; and\n2. Ensuring that the fund is effectively spent.\n\nAt this time, it is expected that the Growth Fund will be used to further the following initiatives:\n1. 80,000,000 TCR (8%) new Service Providers and contractors and employees of existing Service Providers;\n2. 80,000,000 TCR (8%) operational expenditure;\n3. 60,000,000 TCR (6%) cash reserves;\n4. 30,000,000 TCR (3%) advisors; and\n5. 30,000,000 TCR (3%) short-term development.\n\nThis proposal envisages that the remit of the Managers will be decisions involving growth opportunities and operational expenditure related to the the **short-term and long-term development** of Tracer DAO and Tracer. Each of the above initiatives are detailed below:\n1. Engaging contractors and new team members of Service Providers, to perform certain services on behalf of the Tracer DAO. For example, developers and auditors;\n2. Engaging professional services to support the operational and strategic decision-making of the DAO. For examples, lawyers, accountants marketing professionals etc;\n3. Cash reserves to cater for situations where the Growth Fund needs to exchange TCR for non-TCR tokens (particularly USD) to support the aforementioned activities of the Managers. For example, unforeseen expenses and DAO M&As;\n4. Engaging advisors to support operational and strategic decision making of the DAO;\n5. Engaging short-term contributors via proposal or grant (can be retroactively reimbursed) and funding events and programs.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\nInnovative solution ideas were raised within the \u2018Tracer Drop\u2019 call with RMIT [Tracer Drop Episode #04: Development Funds](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/tracer-drop-episode-04-development-funds/336). These ideas will be further explored using the Growth Fund and implemented where deemed suitable. Ideas included:\n\n- Granting funds (TCR tokens) to \u2018philanthropists\u2019 to execute solutions for certain problems;\n     - This effectively combines a typical \u2018Grant\u2019 model with the long-term incentive structure of venture finance; and\n     - These \u2018philanthropists\u2019 in time will receive reputation for their work and will become trusted to deliver future work.\n\n# Commitments\nIf the Managers is engaged to provide the Deliverables, it will:\n1. Not use tokens held in the Growth Fund to vote on Tracer DAO Proposals.\n\n# Variation and Termination\n1. The Managers acknowledge that, if engaged, its engagement can be varied by future Proposals. For the avoidance of doubt, the engagement of certain members of the Managers can also be varied by future Proposals.\n2. The Managers expects that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the deliverables specified above. If the engagement of the Managers is terminated, all remaining tokens in the Growth Fund will be returned to Tracer DAO\u2019s treasury.\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\nIn the context of the Tracer Project, conflicts of interest include:\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nThe Managers wish to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n1. Raymond is a Co-founder of Mycelium, an existing Tracer DAO member (Service Provider);\n2. Ash is also a Co-founder of Mycelium;\n3. Pat is also a Co-founder of Mycelium;\n4. Michael and Vance are Founders of Framework Ventures, an existing Tracer DAO member (Strategic Partner);\n5. Richard (CEO) and Aaron (Research Associate) of DACM, an existing Tracer DAO member (Strategic Partner);\n6. Balder (Managing Partner) and Mathijs (Investment Manager) of Maven11, an existing Tracer DAO member (Strategic Partner); and\n7. Chris (Co-founder) of RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub, an existing Tracer DAO member (Academic Advisor).\n\n# Interpretation\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, the Managers may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\nCopyright and related rights are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).", "choices": ["Accept Growth Fund proposal", "Reject Growth Fund proposal"], "start": 1630396800, "end": 1630569600, "snapshot": "13131423", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4d834700AF7915Ca8441f486bb09268fAd7DEd1E", "space": {"id": "tracer.eth", "name": "Tracer"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWUGukK8dhiXsYTnDLx381T1TiZ4LG4n8JwDdVG75nZrQ", "voter": "0x41b4D7a945d825b288539E5EcD26e623E2f0460a", "created": 1630545020, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXU1NkZuJ916pqcudiyh15QdKV8R3JLvQVD8q8Z875ZFB", "voter": "0xD3Cd153156E97638b7Fe71a8dd4A9a5c3a59A020", "created": 1630523759, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUNnEjdPEsempFKC5CN22EU5v9CFmWVSjRxnsSiTMMFfV", "voter": "0xdE5ff4e6e841ECDdA4599b0a63EEA991e9148444", "created": 1630502432, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXMSZLq2WsYdXTyegPaAV3EVKd3MCwhAYVjQ1GfHXAjV7", "voter": "0x219BaD06180F4024A06C372d754E882D175Df098", "created": 1630442756, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVBZndUVTKGh2TuBTpg1kZyB9ZaBd4GctB4jwWRmSUL3V", "voter": "0x6A4EE72138f3F92BF79eA0d2403F61c0f56eE605", "created": 1630409302, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmamr5PT4ZFTsDRcj9AEhfEnxjQH6EfdT4LGyVRLQdEaUg", "voter": "0xF817554Cc4Ca4Fe435dbF43BD1bACF0d7B0f38d7", "created": 1630408573, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYsjkRb3uu9sYGtXDkzmLTsUbJ72MFr7Qnc6cAgaUiiJB", "voter": "0x05e92fB03d0126cEDd3a5B06020b121e8D3Ca857", "created": 1630406638, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSqsYiGpcWyKVbfXyXnotkmrTL2xu7SWzHZHUdgPssheN", "voter": "0x8A3Ad42D4A6159fceee4bB348Ac72152804b51Bd", "created": 1630399721, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSh2A7A62Eqt2LCkbyweCWU1UePjtBRTJ4uxHASqY26tg", "voter": "0x5eeA91e130Df8767c847d36e7139dC5Dd648bd43", "created": 1630397790, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}]}
