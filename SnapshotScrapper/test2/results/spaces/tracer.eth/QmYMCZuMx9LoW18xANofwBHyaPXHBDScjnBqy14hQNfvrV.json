According to the proposal, Tracer DAO will supply the liquidity for both pools using its treasury funds and have Visor Finance manage the pools. Visor Finance are an active manager focused on liquidity provisioning strategies on Uniswap v3. Visor Finance currently manage over 20 pairs on Uniswap v3, and provide an infrastructure for protocols to use their own treasury funds to provide liquidity and generate yield. the Visor Finance treasury management service caters to the individual needs of the protocols serviced by Visor Finance. For Tracer DAO, the focus will be on providing deeper liquidity for the TCR-ETH pair to support larger volume trades without suffering significant slippage.\n\n# Rationale\nThe current slippage on Sushiswap both on Mainnet and on Arbitrum is very high due to the lack of liquidity. A trade of around ~$3,000 USD will suffer around 2% slippage on Mainnet and even more on Arbitrum. As such, it is of utmost importance to deepen the liquidity for the TCR-ETH trading pair.\n\nThe capital efficiency of Uniswap v3 offers many advantages. Given that much of the liquidity will be concentrated around the current price tick, there will be less slippage for same volume trades on the same amount of liquidity as on Sushiswap (or Uniswap v2). For example, concentrating liquidity around +/-50% of the current price will have 4x the capital efficiency of Sushiswap and may require less than 25% of the liquidity as Sushiswap. See calculation here: [** TCR Capital Efficiency Calculations - Google Sheets 4**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-tcr-eth-uniswap-v3-liquidity-pool-proposal-visor-finance/522). Additionally, the lower liquidity threshold required on Uniswap v3 allows for Tracer to provide the liquidity with its own treasury, diminishing the need to pay liquidity mining rewards for TCR-ETH.\n\nManaging the price range on Uniswap v3 requires active management, which is provided by Visor Finance and its research organization Gamma Strategies. As the price of TCR varies, Visor Finance will ensure that the price stays within range, and that there is sufficient liquidity to support TCR-ETH trade volume.\n\nAt present, there is an urgent need for trading liquidity on the secondary markets. The capital efficiency of Uniswap v3 makes it possible for Tracer to provide that liquidity with its own treasury funds. Doing so saves costs by eliminating the need for liquidity mining rewards for TCR, in addition to generating additional yield for the treasury.\n\n# Consideration\nTo provide further liquidity of the TCR token, Tracer DAO will supply the following for Visor Finance to manage:\n\n1. $500,000 USD equivalent of TCR; and\n2. $500,000 USD equivalent of ETH.\n\n70% of the supplied liquidity will be directed to Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum and the remaning 30% will be directed to Uniswap v3 on Ethereum Mainnet. The 0.3% fee tier shall be used for both pools.\n\nFor the provision of these services, Visor Finance requests:\n\n1. A management fee of 10% of the earned Uniswap fees. 90% of the earned fees are re-invested back into LP positions to increase the balance of liquidity over time.\n# Deliverables\nIf engaged by Proposal to provide the services described in this Proposal to the DAO, Visor Finance will provide the following (***Deliverables***):\n\n1. Ensure that the provided liquidity is effectively managed in the Uniswap v3 Arbitrum and Ethereum Mainnet TCR-ETH pools.\n\n# Variation and Termination\n1. Visor Finance acknowledges that, if engaged, its engagement can be varied or terminated by future Proposals.\n2. Visor Finance expects that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the deliverables specified above.\n3. If this proposal is successful, the liquidity provided by this proposal may be withdrawn via a future proposal.\n# Conflicts of Interest\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nVisor Finance wishes to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1. No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n # Interpretation\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, Visor Finance may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to CC0.", "choices": ["Accept", "Reject"], "start": 1632758400, "end": 1632931200, "snapshot": "13309381", "state": "closed", "author": "0x64ed1b023858dc329Ad0f8bC7C8389FE7e4517FE", "space": {"id": "tracer.eth", "name": "Tracer"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXLXyuVEdaLr3YuMM2eiamagM8JvygZomfWR758npF5tV", "voter": "0xF817554Cc4Ca4Fe435dbF43BD1bACF0d7B0f38d7", "created": 1632921684, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaxgYnh4m6Pa9UQERX8Ba2ovUUsk9RvaoWtzBBiayf32H", "voter": "0xd4E9464660Eb9c5F18A44E3D9DbA9403Da3f3A6b", "created": 1632908030, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdqRqXRrMwDD2yVg67XUpTeEipwZYFk3KtLB7Vzj4RteD", "voter": "0x5eeA91e130Df8767c847d36e7139dC5Dd648bd43", "created": 1632866465, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQCR86hsYNezXUNPqi21tfEtZkrhuC86i3HdrU1WpsCHH", "voter": "0xdE5ff4e6e841ECDdA4599b0a63EEA991e9148444", "created": 1632849409, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWyYQjMmZ3qK4Et54ZBnpijDwT7igkmXAYfT6eE9ExrBR", "voter": "0xe085327c5AD2F77147F10973Fed45Fb19d734F7e", "created": 1632838264, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXFb5upbgqUcUs6uVVhZquXStfn27RusP2erJC7eAgzvC", "voter": "0x6A4EE72138f3F92BF79eA0d2403F61c0f56eE605", "created": 1632814642, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUDKGa5WrH1t9ckzXYwYhjQeFYj7RptS17mrPgSvFo1t3", "voter": "0x4D1271Bf27901DfCB3Fe8D67C52C907B2BB7afcA", "created": 1632810014, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUd3iPwzEDbXMg9o9LvjyBN9a2EmwyqaGhUMsG7nomUV5", "voter": "0xF65C1A89A5A30B4A9743Fe93408b601f4045A504", "created": 1632801143, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbTAvkuwDFELVJ1RoHLB1La3nXrWcWKJiskmxnqeCgJp6", "voter": "0x05e92fB03d0126cEDd3a5B06020b121e8D3Ca857", "created": 1632790914, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdTFAL1WmjZU9uu3HdrJtt3T9mtHhPWGVqtcxKv54kfCM", "voter": "0xB960665D4e601063df28c9067c0d925069cf9142", "created": 1632787990, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVEqmfWTmNtBQHj5GY3DupBE2drs4Ak515fcvmvvmXypk", "voter": "0x219BaD06180F4024A06C372d754E882D175Df098", "created": 1632786979, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUum9khbhkJcV8LWvPD54rcSTeVdbuD8JVgiQ3uGP4S51", "voter": "0x64ed1b023858dc329Ad0f8bC7C8389FE7e4517FE", "created": 1632767652, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}]}
