{"id": "QmU4nSSUeUYcpfe5vWVTFUg2A8X6gxLbDYj3rHNB1n2TRo", "title": "Proposal #17: Sushi MISO Auction - Public distribution event", "body": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal has been formalised based on the previous [**EOI**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/sushi-miso-auction-proposal/432) and [**proposal**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-sushi-miso-auction-public-distribution-event/433) on Tracer DAO's Discourse.\n\nFollowing extensive discussion by Tracer DAO members and the Tracer community [**on Discourse**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/using-gnosis-auction-for-token-distribution-event/242) - this Proposal relates to Tracer DAO engaging [**Sushi**](https://sushi.com/) to conduct a public token distribution event via [**batch auction**](https://instantmiso.gitbook.io/miso/markets/markets) to be conducted on [**Sushi's**](https://sushi.com) [**Minimal Initial Sushiswap Offering**](https://instantmiso.gitbook.io/miso/) (MISO) platform.\n\nSushi's MISO platform is [**described**](https://instantmiso.gitbook.io/miso/) as follows: MISO aims to drive new capital and trade to the exchange by increasing the attractiveness of SushiSwap as a place for token creators and communities to launch new project tokens. \n\nIf this proposal succeeds, Sushi will provide a batch auction for the public token distribution event. Sushi describes batch auctions in its [**documents**](https://instantmiso.gitbook.io/miso/markets/markets) as:\n\n*A Market method whereby a set amount of tokens are divided amongst all the contributors to the Market event, weighted according to their contribution to the pool. Whatever your percentage of the total raise, that's the portion of the total tokens on offer you will receive. Straightforward. Batch Auctions will be useful for projects looking to ensure that everyone taking part is rewarded, no matter their net worth.*\n\nThe reason for proposing the use of Sushi MISO's batch auction over other alternatives, such as [**Gnosis Auction**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/using-gnosis-auction-for-token-distribution-event/242), is that it provides wider visibility for the public token distribution event because it is hosted by Sushi (a large player in DeFi) and also provides the option of simple migration of liquidity to [**Sushiswap Exchange**](https://app.sushi.com/swap) post launch.\n\n# Consideration\n\nUse of the MISO platform is of no cost to Tracer DAO. The passing of this proposal will allow 50,000,000 TCR tokens (5% TCR network equity) to be transferred to the MISO whitelisted address to be provided for the public token distribution event.\n\n# Parameters\n\nThe parameters for this proposal arise from a community poll on the [**Discourse**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/using-gnosis-auction-for-token-distribution-event/242/3) in addition to further advice from strategic partners and academic advisors to Tracer DAO. Additionally the minimum valuation capitalisation is proposed based on a combination of the mentioned polls, previous [**valuations**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-11-strategic-treasury-diversification/286/14) and advice to Tracer DAO from advisors Chris Berg and Peyman Khezr of RMIT made on [**Discourse**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/using-gnosis-auction-for-token-distribution-event/242/26) referencing their research [**paper**](http://chrisberg.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Khezr-and-Berg-TracerDAO-Gnosis-auction-reserve-price.pdf): *Setting the reserve price for the Tracer DAO Gnosis auction*.\n\nThe proposed parameters for the auction are as follows:\n\n1. Total distribution: 50,000,000 TCR (5% TCR network equity)\n2. Bidding token: [DAI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f)\n3. Auction token: [TCR](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9c4a4204b79dd291d6b6571c5be8bbcd0622f050)\n4. Minimum price per token: $0.05 DAI = implied minimum raise of $2,500,000 DAI (min. fully diluted valuation = $50,000,000 DAI)\n5. Auction start date: September 10th\n6. Auction period: 5 days \n7. Auction type: Batch Auction\n\n# Deliverables\n\nIf engaged by Tracer DAO, Sushi will provide a TCR (Tracer governance token) public distribution event for the Tracer protocol via batch auction on the Sushi MISO platform for a total distribution of 50,000,000 TCR (5% network equity).\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nMISO Auction (Sushi) holds the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1. No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).", "choices": ["Accept MISO Auction proposal", "Reject MISO Auction proposal"], "start": 1630918800, "end": 1631091600, "snapshot": "13171156", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4d834700AF7915Ca8441f486bb09268fAd7DEd1E", "space": {"id": "tracer.eth", "name": "Tracer"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmToEeAVUuopEYbp7NwqAsfaMRZHjD2Dk1EmptHypJbm8n", "voter": "0xF65C1A89A5A30B4A9743Fe93408b601f4045A504", "created": 1631037971, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXP9cXXmCwR2DxY7eStAEPtnm2syLr9Bz5LW6BHohgnWw", "voter": "0xF817554Cc4Ca4Fe435dbF43BD1bACF0d7B0f38d7", "created": 1630981857, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQDpKbQ6HZPwb1PymGhjyiaE6pXiM7X8ysj3saeqVymkb", "voter": "0xdE5ff4e6e841ECDdA4599b0a63EEA991e9148444", "created": 1630973924, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPJ5hvgmDdk1WtTkR6BBJ7ED58Zzm25QL1L1x54maBeHp", "voter": "0x6A4EE72138f3F92BF79eA0d2403F61c0f56eE605", "created": 1630940836, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd83cBfaVK3okFFD9Pt1Uewmor3miUqHHnBZh6ZgZ5Gat", "voter": "0xd4E9464660Eb9c5F18A44E3D9DbA9403Da3f3A6b", "created": 1630936721, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXdB84m4QTo9zyHTs9gdci1ZjETghfDQ6qQTRLvUcm6Cs", "voter": "0xADEEb9d09B8Bcee10943198FB6F6a4229bAB3675", "created": 1630935245, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeagVBwT8h7qXJ3KcYGfa796pLFSBLTwX1ckJ66rLysPg", "voter": "0xE4993eD3FA9130e312E99150d661AD591Be8ba63", "created": 1630930883, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdhzTcBqokjXdEQZaNgVBK1ZZEAN4kqfUDPfhjLpDkotF", "voter": "0x05e92fB03d0126cEDd3a5B06020b121e8D3Ca857", "created": 1630924979, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNZzsQghyD3xbaJXbdaojunHue7XmcfRU1HKwe6QihCy1", "voter": "0x8A3Ad42D4A6159fceee4bB348Ac72152804b51Bd", "created": 1630924235, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}]}
