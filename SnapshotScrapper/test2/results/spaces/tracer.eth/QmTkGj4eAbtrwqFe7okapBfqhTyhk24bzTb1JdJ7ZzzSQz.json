I will provide immense value for Tracer DAO through advisory. I have invested and worked with top exchanges worldwide from day 1. Through my experience, I'm able to provide hands-on advice on product design, trading/liquidity mining programs, tokenomics and more.\n\nBesides advisory, Bitlink will also provide liquidity for Tracer through market making service. Bitlink provides liquidity to most known defi projects. We have historically contributed between 20-50% volume on dYdX and been ranked as no.1 on their first month liquidity program.\n\nWith us, we are able to offer the best in class liquidity, providing Tracer with a competitive advantage compared to other major CEX and DEX. It will in turn be beneficial to the token holders.\n\n# Remuneration\n\nFor the provision of my diversification efforts and services, I request:\n\n1. 3,000,000 TCR vested on a pro rata basis over 102 weeks, starting on the day that this proposal is executed.\n\nRemuneration to be provided to address: 0x7c1b4b31fd641E1Ea73E895b3656D93a659f0D0D\n\n# Deliverables\n\nIf I am engaged to provide the services described in this Proposal to the DAO, I will provide the following:\n\n* 1 hour per month of consultation to the Mycelium team.\n* $150,000 USD (in LINK tokens), delivered upon execution of this proposal.\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. I, Chuck Li, acknowledge that, if engaged, my engagement can be varied or terminated by future Proposals.\n2. I expect that any engagement will be terminated if I fail to deliver in accordance with the Deliverables specified above.\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nI, Chuck Li, wish to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1. No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, I, Chuck Li, may introduce more formally documented aspects of the Proposal.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to[ CC0 1 1](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).", "choices": ["Accept Chuck Li proposal", "Reject Chuck Li proposal"], "start": 1631104200, "end": 1631277000, "snapshot": "13185030", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4d834700AF7915Ca8441f486bb09268fAd7DEd1E", "space": {"id": "tracer.eth", "name": "Tracer"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmURkqiipEkqJLgnQKER8sts7whK8q5wCbdiZitBdLjG1M", "voter": "0xE4993eD3FA9130e312E99150d661AD591Be8ba63", "created": 1631257179, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVz4dyzbqxQo2xw4S4GC3JscDZT7Tr1iPDXiYJY286sZH", "voter": "0xE962A349e5b0665c322577F0b7f3c497FDA7556F", "created": 1631242778, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWiH7KBauQ9aouNAaQsKveq29ksqskuqy7mgZ7sFKseUK", "voter": "0x5eeA91e130Df8767c847d36e7139dC5Dd648bd43", "created": 1631241872, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbG9jj2GrcxeZvsEUR5pwSGXoYbFSboZ7ZME4No6fkKNA", "voter": "0x7A1E6e171C312409Bd646b64b8829deD07711f29", "created": 1631233850, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWT8oL6VBktoMZyrAjREcTPzJnN6gMqspqZXk88cb1xqn", "voter": "0xAD0808b39237c95108eaeBEBA7D4b6513B9bF4d5", "created": 1631201669, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXW4iRpvgJ8jtk4yFatAgLUhRCUT7WDBzQsfmbHxY3gkW", "voter": "0x93c3dC0cC0af3525aa7F2ff49272437b44Da1F0B", "created": 1631201506, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPatwxpEaNPsEoGMSTc5GngAvdbhudbapnnFkKirw7bPY", "voter": "0xD3Cd153156E97638b7Fe71a8dd4A9a5c3a59A020", "created": 1631129964, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmenAo4jgJgB4iEk9io3hQfVdcvECoTqBrditpnHX65mMB", "voter": "0xF817554Cc4Ca4Fe435dbF43BD1bACF0d7B0f38d7", "created": 1631116414, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme93RjKzB3bRiXpAhHSj5QvBnbB93gpj29w86gikZKNGD", "voter": "0x6A4EE72138f3F92BF79eA0d2403F61c0f56eE605", "created": 1631116093, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmey6QPe4qexpEZRoVzYEu5JVHxbnh7zriRRZfJXUwQZ7L", "voter": "0x05e92fB03d0126cEDd3a5B06020b121e8D3Ca857", "created": 1631104800, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}]}
