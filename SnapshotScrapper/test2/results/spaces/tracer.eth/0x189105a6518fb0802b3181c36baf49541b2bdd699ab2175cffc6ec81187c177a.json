As per the forecast for the last quarter, it was expected that our costs for quarter 3 and inevitably quarter 4 would significantly increase. Our costs have increased by approximately 220% since that time (approximately U$1.1m per quarter) due to further resource allocation in the following areas:\n\n1. Senior Development hires (2);\n2. Senior Business Development hires (1);\n3. Business Development hires (2); and \n4. Ecosystem/Community hires (2).\n\nIn the coming weeks, we are looking to further expand the team (additional Senior Developers and Marketing leads) to support the following strategic goals:\n\n1. Finalising the Perpetual Pools v2 contracts (SMA pricing, permissionless deployment, solving for volatility decay) and supporting versioning updates;\n2. Greater market exposure and adoption for the Perpetual Pools contract; and\n3. Building DAO frameworks to enable decentralised contributions to Tracer DAO's contracts, community and growth.\n\nWe are currently spending approximately $400k per month. We are currently finalising Mycelium's third quarterly report to Tracer DAO and will publish it in the Discourse in the next week.\n\n## Updates\n\nIn accordance with the Proposal engaging Mycelium, and to assist Mycelium to execute upon these strategic goals, Mycelium requests:\n\n1. The current remuneration of U$250,000.00 (or equivalent) per month (or part thereof) is increased to U$500,000.00 (or equivalent) per month (or part thereof) starting on the day that a Proposal implementing this Proposal is executed and ending when Mycelium is no longer engaged by the DAO, to be paid on the last day of each calendar month. If a payment does not occur because the DAO has insufficient funds, the amount of that payment will accrue and be paid to Mycelium when the DAO has sufficient funds to pay for that calendar month.\n\nIt is expected that all other aspects of Mycelium\u2019s engagement, detailed in the Proposal passed on 12 February 2021, will remain the same.\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables and Commitments\n\nIf this proposal succeeds, Mycelium\u2019s Deliverables and Commitments, as outlined in the Proposal passed on 10 February 2021 as well as the update proposal passed on 14 July, will remain the same.\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. Mycelium acknowledges that, if engaged, its engagement can be varied by future Proposals.\n2. Mycelium expects that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the deliverables specified above.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer Project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nMycelium wishes to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1. It is an existing Service Provider to Tracer DAO.\n\n---\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, Mycelium may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n---\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).", "choices": ["Accept Mycelium update proposal", "Reject Mycelium update proposal"], "start": 1635580800, "end": 1635753600, "snapshot": "13517213", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4d834700AF7915Ca8441f486bb09268fAd7DEd1E", "space": {"id": "tracer.eth", "name": "Tracer"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xdf83c37d0a1686884d510483dbdd07c9ad95bdf66d5308ebaa285df1295cf6e6", "voter": "0x05e92fB03d0126cEDd3a5B06020b121e8D3Ca857", "created": 1635723275, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1443b754d038b852fafceb87cd076bce2bbbaaf761b384807bf305a938a400cf", "voter": "0x219BaD06180F4024A06C372d754E882D175Df098", "created": 1635721127, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0x90c0f2e1a7914fd1bcb56b43003b3524328ffde34b6c38d7b41d168e8bfb0d15", "voter": "0x4D1271Bf27901DfCB3Fe8D67C52C907B2BB7afcA", "created": 1635670214, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0xcd7e951ffabc5023d3ffae04183ab63956d043ce16a7f4bd770a3a7db85bd1a1", "voter": "0xB64C462A155dBe151fA34f402C12564671eE08Cb", "created": 1635654703, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe66f72de61d974920b8c9f9c77bb2f6b39c7f60eb6ad0b2c2114b3a2b1f08b54", "voter": "0xB960665D4e601063df28c9067c0d925069cf9142", "created": 1635584260, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}]}
