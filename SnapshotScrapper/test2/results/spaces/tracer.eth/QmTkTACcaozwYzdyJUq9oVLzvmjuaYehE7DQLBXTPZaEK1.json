{"id": "QmTkTACcaozwYzdyJUq9oVLzvmjuaYehE7DQLBXTPZaEK1", "title": "Proposal #22: Runtime Verification Perpetual Pools Audit", "body": "# Summary\nDiscourse link: [**here**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-runtime-verification-perpetual-pools-audit/523)\n\nTracer DAO is considering engaging [**Runtime Verification**](https://runtimeverification.com/smartcontract/) for an audit of Tracer\u2019s codebase. Runtime Verification provide a smart contract analysis and verification service with experience in formal modelling, analysis, safety, security, validation and verification. They have worked with \"*NASA, DARPA, Boeing, and Toyota, on formalizing and verifying safety and mission critical systems, and with IOHK and the Ethereum Foundation to formally model and verify not only smart contracts, but also consensus protocols, programming languages and virtual machines.*\n\nThis audit will be a 7 week process, during which Runtime Verification will detail any errors found with the **Tracer Perpetual Pools** and **vesting contracts** codebase. The Mycelium team will work with Runtime Verification throughout the audit to fix any bugs and help them to navigate and understand the codebase. This initiative aligns with the Tracer Whitepaper ([**Tracer: Peer-to-Peer Finance**](https://tracer.finance/media/white-papers/peer-to-peer/peer-to-peer-finance.pdf)), where it was set out that Tracer DAO would adhere to strict security standards in relation to its smart contracts.\n\nIf engaged by Tracer DAO, Runtime Verification will commence work on 25 October 2021. This proposal seeks to remunerate Runtime Verification for their services to Tracer DAO.\n\n# Consideration\n\nFor the provision of these services, Runtime Verification requests:\n\n1. 105,000 USDC immediately; and\n2. 105,000 USDC at the conclusion of the audit.\n\n# Deliverables\n\nIf Runtime Verification is engaged by Tracer DAO via proposal, it will provide the services in accordance with the points below:\n\n1. Provide a comprehensive security audit for the Perpetual Pools contracts; and\n2. Provide a comprehensive security audit for the DAO vesting contracts.\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. Runtime Verification acknowledges that, if engaged, its engagement can be varied or terminated by future Proposals.\n2. Runtime Verification expects that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the deliverables specified above.\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nRuntime Verification wishes to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1. No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter that are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, Runtime Verification may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [**CC0**](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).", "choices": ["Accept Runtime Verification", "Reject Runtime Verification"], "start": 1632880800, "end": 1633053600, "snapshot": "13317747", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4d834700AF7915Ca8441f486bb09268fAd7DEd1E", "space": {"id": "tracer.eth", "name": "Tracer"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWDX5rWG3kGQvkK2suNj1R5a6cQDYdHvhQySeS9rrBu1N", "voter": "0xB960665D4e601063df28c9067c0d925069cf9142", "created": 1633026929, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUG8txb9jsB373iqEgJkNQUkSq7LTxCki5QUvbojzZ6fC", "voter": "0x55F4f271408F36299222d5C2ecB95D33ea1c99ee", "created": 1633021279, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTERpQ2QY5XKWsNjKZtviZzHuhuUmBfuBsn5bbTVBFhNy", "voter": "0xe085327c5AD2F77147F10973Fed45Fb19d734F7e", "created": 1632984660, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVzzpBXCcLcNaa6gRAfdLuhkUMBsZQERGqRuhcCffAJJw", "voter": "0xF65C1A89A5A30B4A9743Fe93408b601f4045A504", "created": 1632974858, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRRN3xCmTHxXYRfEKPJBp4xd1GrkbZjbcDn9K4QL2r2Bv", "voter": "0x3F3E305C4Ad49271EBDA489dd43d2c8F027d2D41", "created": 1632967859, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTAUa9R4wrxEqVfL4mfa6fTkjXG71byxc46Ar3MVACN7Q", "voter": "0xdE5ff4e6e841ECDdA4599b0a63EEA991e9148444", "created": 1632936412, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVGN7mWZtuHJtQFMBLSyuiYbcNfmLkenymAX7ZbLTPx15", "voter": "0x6A4EE72138f3F92BF79eA0d2403F61c0f56eE605", "created": 1632934704, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ8W2GAzRb8ycvAMnL5pxaddFgviDwpJCmhjSeywkg4rt", "voter": "0xF817554Cc4Ca4Fe435dbF43BD1bACF0d7B0f38d7", "created": 1632921700, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYSPoUGwJncPAxJzhfuApmhisDUSzb8ojyTHm6Bgcmk9j", "voter": "0x219BaD06180F4024A06C372d754E882D175Df098", "created": 1632915042, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdjpEc6EZPjhgRmipzrMHEFNJqGE3PNfEv9j1Qh4wjFkm", "voter": "0xbb430eED7aBd721639cf916F548D943B3A5e7aE2", "created": 1632908500, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd2AtoFsGVTLseE6bnyLrzk4FuC7GUUQvCNnVHauMMUbF", "voter": "0xd4E9464660Eb9c5F18A44E3D9DbA9403Da3f3A6b", "created": 1632899311, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmay7gkWyomTx6KNudCYqdkpmNRQEDoRZfvpn5ztN8ty3E", "voter": "0x8A3Ad42D4A6159fceee4bB348Ac72152804b51Bd", "created": 1632891243, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcZUNgTHtWfRwBkc9uAtpfu724ibBc5wstPH9qsLGdLgr", "voter": "0x05e92fB03d0126cEDd3a5B06020b121e8D3Ca857", "created": 1632887718, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVEKdna56UXvdfCBbbesiMb8A4nvRoxeML8nG1hg8KvHk", "voter": "0x4D1271Bf27901DfCB3Fe8D67C52C907B2BB7afcA", "created": 1632886438, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSRBppjGhkD26Hci4wASZAYEjCY7LZBsuXgU1Me8LT4eZ", "voter": "0x4d834700AF7915Ca8441f486bb09268fAd7DEd1E", "created": 1632885905, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdsG6pCR24VuYsLLPqhqtEvUdfcjxj8Gc2pbvKEXrwZ9L", "voter": "0x5eeA91e130Df8767c847d36e7139dC5Dd648bd43", "created": 1632883077, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}]}
