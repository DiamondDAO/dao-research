Risk Harbor has provided risk management and protection services for other major DeFi protocols including Anchor, Element Finance, and Iron Finance.\n\nRisk Harbor\u2019s services aim to provide the following:\n\n1. Protect against smart contract risk and network vulnerabilities;\n2. Invest safely and earn risk-adjusted rewards by providing protection; and\n3. Maximise capital efficiency with market-informed dynamic pricing.\n\nRisk Harbor offers its services to Tracer DAO in order to work with the DAO on initially insuring Tracer DAO\u2019s Perpetual Pools financial contract against smart contract risk. In addition to allowing the ability for individual users to protect themselves using our services, this proposal aims to have Tracer DAO protecting each of the currently offered markets in Perpetual Pools including:\n\n3L ETH token;\n3S ETH token;\n1L ETH token; and\n1S ETH token.\n\nThis proposal is to offer protection on the above markets in the case of smart contract failure as specified within our documentation 1. Initially, this proposal, if successful, will implement \u2018protection pools\u2019 that are funded by the DAO to emphasize Tracer DAO\u2019s approach to security against smart contract failure. These pools will be initially allocated with 100k USDC per market as listed in the above dot points (400k USDC total). As Perpetual Pools moves toward v2 and market conditions change, further proposals may be proposed to increase these protection pools and/or add protection to the BTC/USD and other Perpetual Pool tokens.\n\n# Next Steps\nIn order for this proposal to take effect, it must be pushed to Snapshot by a DAO member and that Proposal must succeed.\n\nWe encourage the discussion of this proposal in the comments below.\n* * *\n# Consideration\nFor the provision of these services, Risk Harbor requests:\n\n400k USDC to protect against smart contract failure across the 4 different ETH/USD Pool tokens on Tracer DAO\u2019s Perpetual Pools financial contract:\n\n1L-ETH/USDC\n\n1S-ETH/USDC\n\n3L-ETH/USDC\n\n3S-ETH/USDC\n* * *\n# Deliverables\n\nIf engaged by Proposal to provide the services described in this Proposal to the DAO, Risk Harbor will provide the following (Deliverables):\n\n1. Risk Harbor builds wrappers and contracts defining how depeg events are detected, and will launch protection pools for the select Tracer DAO perpetual pools products listed below:\n3L-ETH/USD\n3S-ETH/USD\n1L-ETH/USD\n1S-ETH/USD\n\n2. Tracer DAO to purchase protection for their users:\nAll users will then be protected (on a pro-rata basis), depending on the available protection capacity. This is a strong signal for Tracer depositors and will increase new and existing engagement for TracerDAO users as a whole as they are programmatically protected against any loss event. It is also a marketing rallying point to the ecosystem as a whole.\n\n3. Tracer DAO will underwrite Tracer DAO protection pools on Risk Harbor:\nThis shows that the Tracer DAO team is confident in their product - to the extent that they are willing to underwrite Tracer DAO protection on Risk Harbor and provide capacity for users and the community to protect themselves against any events of risk.\n400K USDC initial underwriting capacity from Tracer DAO allocated as detailed in the Considerations section. Underwriting capital will be reallocated across pools, as they expire, optimistically until Tracer DAO votes otherwise.\n\n4. Risk Harbor community admirals and team members provide support to Tracer DAO protection buyers:\nTutorials, documentation, etc. if needed\nContinuous customer support in Discord, Telegram, Twitter, etc.\n* * *\nOther sections omitted due to max word limit", "choices": ["Accept this proposal", "Reject this proposal"], "start": 1636948800, "end": 1637121600, "snapshot": "13615200", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6815084e9b2abb657b377f6DcA85ee7A1d2C1d89", "space": {"id": "tracer.eth", "name": "Tracer"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xa6fef40419b41ba112e068f7f13cbe07ba53b0fb1ae7f63868ceaff9b406e73b", "voter": "0x05e92fB03d0126cEDd3a5B06020b121e8D3Ca857", "created": 1637116991, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0ab08e6140649e58b8733abfe0f7633422ce23b94dc45e90bb75cd2b578eb420", "voter": "0x4d834700AF7915Ca8441f486bb09268fAd7DEd1E", "created": 1637109298, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe7c5d3785000f867076dab15b0cfdad70ad080be8e07630f0a3f6c915acae9d6", "voter": "0x7F7F671d60D784272176B0e1c86Cc81f0DAca57f", "created": 1637074447, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0x494d279487631f962ddd218959870631917bad7a0c261f333c60f68e2f9ee92a", "voter": "0xB64C462A155dBe151fA34f402C12564671eE08Cb", "created": 1636956463, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0x4e1927963e4415c2946f35c137ee5a17bbc89d6419bb91f3b874a9e541551114", "voter": "0x5eeA91e130Df8767c847d36e7139dC5Dd648bd43", "created": 1636951993, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe7c31568f5045a9a14582d19f05437e8bea84276d3dffcddf6899d2e2ae3ba42", "voter": "0x6815084e9b2abb657b377f6DcA85ee7A1d2C1d89", "created": 1636949700, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "0x32cdd21cf1024bae019fd8d12385bdeea8227de624e0ec0ec4ddea9cefad8e01", "voter": "0xB960665D4e601063df28c9067c0d925069cf9142", "created": 1636948999, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}]}
