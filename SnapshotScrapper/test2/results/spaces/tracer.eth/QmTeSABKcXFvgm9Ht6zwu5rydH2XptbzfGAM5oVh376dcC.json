Bankless started in 2019 as a newsletter, and added a podcast in 2020. In 2021, we have earned our place as a self-sustaining media company dedicated to democratizing access to information across the DeFi landscape.\n\nAs a commitment to these values, we planted our flag with Bankless DAO, the first media and culture-centric DAO, on a mission to propagate crypto media, culture, and values to 1 billion people.\n\nA key component of the Bankless mission is our marketing partnerships, in which we develop mutually-beneficial relationships with projects we believe in. The unique advantage of partnering with Bankless is the opportunity to work with an informed team that cares about DeFi values, as well as access to a powerful network of loyal followers who trust our partners.\n\nWe have found particular success in our \u2018Blitz\u2019 campaigns, which involve focused, 2-week sessions of intense media coverage across our Twitter, Youtube, Podcast, and Newsletter platforms. These Blitzes work especially well when announcing new projects, events, or exciting community developments. Flexibility in our content, communication with our partners and partnering communities, and crafting organic & engaging narratives are all important to us.\n\nThe scope of the partnership is set out below, detailing two such Blitzes to take place August 16-31 and September 16-30 of 2021.\n\nWe are excited to team up with Tracer DAO and spread the word of its innovative and capital efficient approach to derivative contracts. We are interested in following Tracer DAO\u2019s progress and want to be a part of its launch into the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n**Remuneration**\nFor the provision of these services, Bankless requests:\n\n*30,000 USDC* to be paid immediately upon approval of the Proposal.\nDeliverables\nIf engaged by Proposal to provide the services described in this Proposal to the DAO, Bankless will provide the following (Deliverables):\n\n\u2022 A Two-Week Marketing Blitz Campaign on Bankless\u2019s Media Platforms (August 16-31) consisting of:\n- 4x 10 Second Mentions on Podcasts (and show notes)\n- 4x 10 Second Mentions on Videos (and show notes)\n- 8x Tweets across our primary Twitter accounts\n- 5x Newsletter Mentions\n\n\u2022 A Two-Week Marketing Blitz Campaign on Bankless\u2019s Media Platforms (September 16-30) consisting of:\n- 4x 10 Second Mentions on Podcasts (and show notes)\n- 4x 10 Second Mentions on Videos (and show notes)\n- 8x Tweets across our primary Twitter accounts\n- 5x Newsletter Mentions\n\n**Variation and Termination**\nBankless acknowledges that, if engaged, its engagement can be varied or terminated by future Proposals.\nBankless expects that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the deliverables specified above.\n\n**Conflicts of Interest**\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n- Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n- Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nBankless wishes to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n- No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n**Interpretation**\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, Bankless may introduce more formally documented aspects of the Proposal.\n\n**Copyright Waiver**\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [***CC0***](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).", "choices": ["Accept Bankless Partnership", "Reject Bankless Partnership"], "start": 1627534800, "end": 1627707600, "snapshot": "12917864", "state": "closed", "author": "0x27412e76f372bd30400D6883B010C50909d5258d", "space": {"id": "tracer.eth", "name": "Tracer"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQgDbXzT1Ecdf86wQYwgkfpVHHjxJMpsQmZybqfFaPFuT", "voter": "0x5DbB9aC850B1DA38c332b68e2045186F1339CaF4", "created": 1627706698, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmagTvBHGGzHZ5DatgnvZcUSWX2A3cz6or1y2GAVwFJXsv", "voter": "0x3babBC5E1566DE998ffc82D73510647D835e01B6", "created": 1627702335, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme4NcQb9cG842LzKH42fiCEX26CmXp1hqcXRMkbstdxBD", "voter": "0x7A1E6e171C312409Bd646b64b8829deD07711f29", "created": 1627691152, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdfQo73AK3zBBn6JvTyswVhuMKmjxGnPVKmeHFErNv8Nz", "voter": "0xF65C1A89A5A30B4A9743Fe93408b601f4045A504", "created": 1627671969, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbvZEpHYmd9Um3QWLhmuSqPh8cXKrV274Y2eeNmDMPQpd", "voter": "0x05e92fB03d0126cEDd3a5B06020b121e8D3Ca857", "created": 1627658769, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf6qtxsJDXFNxSUD2AbEv1JkjzPiVuBSKu3jqeBLByUqN", "voter": "0xdE5ff4e6e841ECDdA4599b0a63EEA991e9148444", "created": 1627654234, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmced36VVpLFxbhJxf8WKEbDto3k98YEwDWksx8rhiFScw", "voter": "0x8A3Ad42D4A6159fceee4bB348Ac72152804b51Bd", "created": 1627633139, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRLkXxYADN3AWu35g5xmjQwstcXbEEXn36u6uGVQa51fZ", "voter": "0x46B8FfC41F26cd896E033942cAF999b78d10c277", "created": 1627624520, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP1Zr7EQn7DjPb6oTKHzqA1zzvtUwGytYAfDWkakZDdtZ", "voter": "0xd7988b659063352A3867979f8F35181A5835b439", "created": 1627621938, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd5QjMKA483ghMMJRx2tySJWu2D4jk1wQ6yu6Bgi3nmtX", "voter": "0x5eeA91e130Df8767c847d36e7139dC5Dd648bd43", "created": 1627597890, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNcQfXkzGsb5Rx9bvoPVC6i6YwLvR9rroNd1mQwfk7Aow", "voter": "0x219BaD06180F4024A06C372d754E882D175Df098", "created": 1627592205, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeRjScqfXbFG8xxhKeuzHGKzPwFRWdZftyp6dte33NWV9", "voter": "0xd814B879edBc928601A48887a2953F2Ddf0e237e", "created": 1627541250, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}]}
