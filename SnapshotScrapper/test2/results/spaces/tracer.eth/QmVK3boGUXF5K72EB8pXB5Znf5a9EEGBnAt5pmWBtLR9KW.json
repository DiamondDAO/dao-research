{"id": "QmVK3boGUXF5K72EB8pXB5Znf5a9EEGBnAt5pmWBtLR9KW", "title": "Proposal #27: Advisors and Growth Consultants: Ryan Sean Adams and David Hoffman", "body": "# Summary\n\nDiscourse link: [**here**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/advisors-and-growth-consultants-ryan-sean-adams-and-david-hoffman/445)\n\nRyan Sean Adams (RSA) and David Hoffman (David) are jointly proposing a growth consulting and strategic advisory service for Tracer DAO.\n\nBoth of us have played an instrumental role in building thriving DeFi communities and propagating core narratives in the space. As advisors, we would apply our community building, media strategy, and narrative building skills to propel the growth of Tracer DAO.\n\nAdditionally, we believe Tracer DAO will need connections, allies, and partnerships, both in the DeFi ecosystem and in the traditional world. Our work as Media producers of the Bankless podcast (1 million downloads per month) and the Bankless newsletter (80,000 subscribers) has given us an extensive network of relationships across exchanges, funds, media, and influential individuals. As advisors, we can lend this network to help with introductions and advice.\n\nWe believe strongly in a bankless future.\n\nWe also believe DeFi needs a strong and capital efficient derivatives market such as those found on centralized exchanges. To date, centralized parties haved dwarfed DeFi perpetuals products by all measures. We believe Tracer DAO has an opportunity to change that by building a decentralized perpetuals primitive that surpasses centralized alternatives and brings us closer to a more bankless future.\n\n## Growth Fund Allocation\nIf successful, this proposal will draw TCR from the [Growth Fund](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385). As the Growth Fund is currently not implemented, this proposal will draw TCR from the DAO treasury. The amount of TCR will be deducted from the Growth Fund allocation.\n\n---\n\n# Remuneration\n\nFor the provision of our diversification efforts and services, we request:\n\n1. 3,500,000 TCR vested on a pro rata basis over 91 weeks, starting on the day that this proposal is executed; and\n\n2. 50% of the above TCR remuneration will be provided to RSA and 50% will be provided to David.\n\nRemuneration to be provided to addresses:\n**RSA Address (RSA.eth)**: 0xe9d18dbfd105155eb367fcfef87eaaafd15ea4b2\n**David Address**: 0x9f8D8096489d7d0e1A1051ABa87D34024447b7e3\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\nIf we are engaged to provide the services described in this Proposal, we will provide the following:\n\n* 1 hour per week of consultation to the Mycelium team in connection with its development of Tracer;\n* Private advisor channel with response to requests for assistance in 48 hours; and\n* Regular presence in the Tracer DAO community\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. We, RSA and David, acknowledge that, if engaged, our engagement can be varied or terminated by future Proposals. However, this termination is limited to 2,000,000 TCR which relates to my advisory efforts; and\n2. We expect that any engagement will be terminated if we fail to deliver in accordance with the Deliverables specified above.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nWe, RSA and David, wish to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1. Angel investment in Lyra Finance - RSA.\n\n---\n\n# Clarification\n\nAny advisory service provided by RSA or David will not provide Tracer DAO any unearned access to Bankless related podcasts or newsletters. Bankless editorial decisions are merit-based only.\n\n---\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, we, RSA and David, may introduce more formally documented aspects of the Proposal.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n- RSA and David\n\nAuthors:\n\n[Ryan Sean Adams] is a crypto investor, advisor, & co-founder of Bankless.
