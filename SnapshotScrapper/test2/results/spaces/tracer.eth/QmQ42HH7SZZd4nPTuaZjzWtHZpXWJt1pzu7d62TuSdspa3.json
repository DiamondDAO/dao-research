If DAO members are in favour of the recommendation, the proposal can be pushed to Snapshot to commence voting. The proposal must be then passed and pushed onchain to engage the Alpha Testers.\n\nAs mentioned, this proposal is a recommendation which is open to suggestions for any changes that members see fit. Members are able convey such suggestions in the comments thread below. If a change is deemed worthy by the DAO, the proposal can be updated before it is pushed for voting.\n\n# Summary\nTracer DAO (DAO) is considering accepting 100 applicants from the 1650 alpha testing applications it received while applications were open (the Alpha Testers). Lion\u2019s Mane has curated a list of applicants to present to DAO members for discussion and selection. The process for curating the list can be found here: Alpha Testing Applications Selection Process.\n\nBefore the Ethereum mainnet launch of Tracer\u2019s Perpetual Swaps, these Alpha Testers will be required to test the protocol\u2019s code to ensure that it is functional, secure and rid of any bugs. Alpha Testers will also serve the purpose of reviewing the protocol\u2019s UI/UX to suggest any improvements or fixes before the product is ready for mainnet. The recommended Alpha Testers were filtered based on the best of the following characteristics:\n\n- Traders;\n- Market Makers;\n- Insurers;\n- Liquidations; and\n- Oracle Experts.\n\nIt is important to remember that this process is designed to cultivate the best possible group of Alpha Testers to ensure the protocol is as good as it can be.\n\nThe following Proposal, if accepted, will accept 100 applicants into the DAO, as Alpha Testers. The full list can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v2qdYu1ptOuIzmEjb5h2tgApEbppNgvGFVMbAfzGX1Y/edit#gid=1533278785)\n\n# Consideration\nIf this Proposal is accepted, each Alpha Tester will receive the following:\n\n- 1 TCR governance token vested on the day that the Alpha Tester is engaged; and\n- 24,999 TCR vesting in equal monthly instalments over a two year period, starting on the day that the Alpha Tester is engaged, except during the first two months following engagement. On the first day following those first two months, 1/12 of the tokens will vest.\n\n# Deliverables\nIf this Proposal is accepted, Alpha Testers will provide the following (collectively the Deliverables ):\n\n- Active engagement in Alpha Testing of Tracer\u2019s Perpetual Swaps contract; and\n- Active engagement in Tracer\u2019s communications channels (Discourse, Discord, Twitter).\n\n# Variation and Termination\n- Alpha Testers acknowledge that, if engaged, their engagement can be varied by future Proposals.\n- Alpha Testers expect that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the Deliverables specified above.\n\n# Interpretation\nUnless otherwise defined in this Proposal, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires. The singular includes the plural, and the converse also applies.\n\nIf this Proposal is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, members may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to CC0.", "choices": ["Accept alpha testers", "Reject alpha testers"], "start": 1619319600, "end": 1619924400, "snapshot": "12306486", "state": "closed", "author": "0x41b4D7a945d825b288539E5EcD26e623E2f0460a", "space": {"id": "tracer.eth", "name": "Tracer"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZAtRh33fe5mUwYzLUh2tzbq5X6YD9J1kqce8V5nsxx2D", "voter": "0x13cCDb2080483d7cf9545f496457d393994B7Da6", "created": 1619827862, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf1VSNLcmfr673kYYL4znfqM6rQ7GMj8btfHQQLJWuA54", "voter": "0x5DbB9aC850B1DA38c332b68e2045186F1339CaF4", "created": 1619649454, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQajHVWfADGZSmrFSPDmpNy1qnRUbcVDDePwts7VKuc46", "voter": "0x6F2A8Ee9452ba7d336b3fba03caC27f7818AeAD6", "created": 1619582518, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSjEygtNaKzDRwDhzZX3xxCxyXHyxgMPFx8Va3xk4er8v", "voter": "0x2431EE5776B55a82187A1313a32d994c77c0B858", "created": 1619570374, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb4DU7531N3K8Jvz9XHTUr4h6roMN22y1bLdtar11d3rr", "voter": "0xF0170d8fA923D7CDdF9C86E80B6B6c9429255235", "created": 1619565933, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTXeWtzhCXxhHoiXXtNKfbqVd8tV7FYBZbRrzajLAdnvj", "voter": "0x21d507A87c77A6A27E0E8284ccFD48aDda71c814", "created": 1619499772, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdvbYi5mH74N9wNeSc22R1495ACrgL8ExnUJtvNoyB8Yb", "voter": "0x3babBC5E1566DE998ffc82D73510647D835e01B6", "created": 1619499754, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYGG25CRkn9bru9Lo3irEuePDjG6KmPVWYQ1YxrUbr1ri", "voter": "0x219BaD06180F4024A06C372d754E882D175Df098", "created": 1619476321, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTP9aoUT6hZbaMUVu4fHDWep1HmfuAvHqLZNKpyuAPwWy", "voter": "0x5eeA91e130Df8767c847d36e7139dC5Dd648bd43", "created": 1619319805, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tracer.eth"}}]}
