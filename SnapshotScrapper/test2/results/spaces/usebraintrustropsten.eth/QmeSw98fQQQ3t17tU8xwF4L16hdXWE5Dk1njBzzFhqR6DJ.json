Meet your matches and start reviewing proposals. If you don\u2019t take action on your job in 11 days, we will automatically close the role. CTA: Review Candidates\n-> 5 days: repeat email, \u201cif you don\u2019t take action on your job in 9 days, we will\u2026\u201d\n-> 10 days: It looks like this job may have decreased in your priority. Would you like to pause your search and close this job (URL to Client Dashboard)? If not, please review your candidate list. If you don\u2019t take action on this project in 4 days, we will close the job automatically. CTA: Review Candidates\n-> 13 days: You haven\u2019t taken action on your job yet. If we don\u2019t hear from you in the next 24 hours, we will close it automatically.\n-> 14 days: We\u2019ve automatically inactivated your job posting due to inactivity. We\u2019ve notified candidates that this job is on pause. When you\u2019re ready to reactivate your job you can do so here. Talent that has previously applied will be able to easily reapply if they are still interested and available.\n\n- The countdown will not start until the job has at least one proposal. When a client takes an action, the countdown will restart.\n- Actions to qualify remaining open include: view the individual proposal, change the status of a proposal, send a message, etc)\n\nRISKS:\n- Any automation comes with the risk of taking an unintended action.\n\nVOTE:\n- (A) Add this feature to the backlog, with the general execution and high-level requirements as outlined above. We may make minor adjustments but will stay true to the general plan.\n- (B) Add this feature to the backlog, but with a different set of requirements. Go back to a temperature check with new execution guidelines. (Discuss recommendations in Discord).\n- (C) Do not add this feature to the backlog\n", "choices": ["(A) Add to backlog as is", "(B) Add but with different reqs", "(C) Do not add this feature"], "start": 1626451200, "end": 1626750000, "snapshot": "10651395", "state": "closed", "author": "0xcA7b7B124F7F9950Cfd186892cB6E0a0Ab468F8B", "space": {"id": "usebraintrustropsten.eth", "name": "Braintrust (Ropsten)"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
