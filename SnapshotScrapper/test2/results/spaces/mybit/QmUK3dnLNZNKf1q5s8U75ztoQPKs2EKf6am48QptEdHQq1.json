We can always look into increasing the fees later on if we need to, but right now we need 1 thing and 1 thing only - users. So we must value users more than anything else right now, and make things as easy as possible on them.\n\nWhat I propose is a combination of 2 things:\n\n\u2022 Lower the foundation fee (extra fee) to 3% instead of 5%. So if someone wants to invest 1000 DAI, it only costs 1030 DAI total instead of 1050.\n\n\u2022 Lower the foundation share (ownership stake in the asset) to 1%. So if someone invests enough to get 10% of the asset, they actually still get 9.9% instead of 9.5%.\n\nUnder the current fee structure, let's say an asset costs 10,000 DAI and the asset manager has their management fee set at 10%. At face value, an investor who wants the whole asset can invest the 10,000 DAI and get 90% of the asset since the management fee is set at 10%. But in practice, they would have to invest 10,500 DAI and only receive 85% of the asset - this is a huge difference and will likely cause them to think twice about making the investment.\n\nUnder the structure I am proposing, they would invest 10,300 DAI and receive 89% of the asset - still different than what they intended, but much better than the first scenario.", "choices": ["Yes, change it to 3% foundation fee and 1% foundation share", "No, keep it the same", "3% fee and remove the foundation share altogether"], "start": 1601643600, "end": 1602248400, "snapshot": "10975684", "state": "closed", "author": "0x48a96544B24f77B3410AEB3d694c054f1eC94F55", "space": {"id": "mybit", "name": "MyBit"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmcgkVhjJmBVS9c7u3V6GYrFDAKVwc2ac2455GiE2uS8KP", "voter": "0x6b18d96b493CD5668893Bb2d8374ceE808604957", "created": 1602156384, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mybit"}}, {"id": "QmQwpjkFUw7gAGM5YHNZj1rtkjQw3KmE7hRVshBbh7nhMP", "voter": "0x5fD89D0Deaf063Aff411dc66F2332659FdF2A34F", "created": 1602097829, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mybit"}}, {"id": "QmczrTTBCuHdrgQe7JiQU5bfuPys4dcgGc7E3rBhid7Mvb", "voter": "0x44f40e0A9Eb72caAeaE56FD69C87ADf5dAFEBdC4", "created": 1601735508, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mybit"}}, {"id": "QmZc4brLy468Te8NkxnebEvS9q41J1mV17kxVBBLLRYBBi", "voter": "0xBE5d3C961aDA34bD82b177F2F457B6629458D86f", "created": 1601716064, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mybit"}}, {"id": "QmR6HzCLXAM3WEikavUz1aAfsYpFS5wMmrGMtqCMucUCAd", "voter": "0x48a96544B24f77B3410AEB3d694c054f1eC94F55", "created": 1601703231, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mybit"}}, {"id": "QmNamCHupjcALfLK3JVuPBgZtNekuDVZhwqEf2hoR15vpA", "voter": "0x4ff2981956c8116c32a2F2628c86623537514669", "created": 1601678773, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mybit"}}, {"id": "QmZG35mnZ38e2nxw2JTWw7bepF9GCsAvxAEJguYXYvLUeP", "voter": "0x81F75c23A1096e3174ee4f5B7e582ae6a448Cd3c", "created": 1601657712, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mybit"}}, {"id": "QmbZouqswE8ikn1a5BPfEwoFAo2eczWUL3NEXBLEEdcudY", "voter": "0xE3a45ad8a69E129d357c1C4b5Cd352EFbc06aE12", "created": 1601649897, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mybit"}}, {"id": "Qmbv1pidUnBdmm8XwhTx29Qm8ZKocU1eVaBYShmHQ9Btrn", "voter": "0x7d675f49526a9e017D0Ad6bC6821297B7074Eb8F", "created": 1601646832, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mybit"}}, {"id": "QmUYowYQvrFFHrfDWFqDdgqTQDKEseGgTLXRQxstGFLyEZ", "voter": "0x7e6d34f441c5469A25d4E9b1BcDc4805D0ACfBeF", "created": 1601645538, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mybit"}}]}
