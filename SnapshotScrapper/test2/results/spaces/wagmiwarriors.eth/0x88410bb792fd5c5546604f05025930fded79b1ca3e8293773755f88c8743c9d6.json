Almost a daily user since. Lots of baazaar activity and been petting my Gotchis from the start. Have multiple H1 in top 200 kinship. Started small but couldnt help myself to put in more and more funds since. Been doing lots of extensive research on everything about the game and really optimised rarity farming in respect to my investment. \nCan't wait for it to launch!\n\nLove what you have been doing with Aavegotchistats.com and all the work you already put into the Wagmi Warriors Guild. Although, I must admit I pretty much hate fast food chains like McDonalds, I do really love a yummie burger ;)\n\nI want to be part of a Guild that can optimize farming for everyone with many members that are not only willing to invest their GHST and Parcels but also some time and effort, so WAGMI!\n\nShould be able to manage transactions most days, but chose \"every few days\" since there can always be some days I am w/o internet access or just prioritizing family over anything crypto.\n\nHardware wallet? Yes\n\nHow frequently will you generally be able to check-in to manage transactions on the Gnosis Safe?
