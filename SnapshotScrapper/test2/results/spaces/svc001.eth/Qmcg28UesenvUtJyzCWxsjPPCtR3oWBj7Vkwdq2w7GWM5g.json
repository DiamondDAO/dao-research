These tokens would then be burned. In addition, if sufficient liquidity is on Sushiswap for a similar discount, ETH may be used at the discretion of the DAO Council to buy back those tokens as well.\n\nThis would allow significant holders with exit liquidity while benefiting other SVC001 holders whose share of both remaining ETH in the fund and other investments would increase. It also allows the fund to provide liquidity without reducing diversification, which would occur if the fund provided ETH/SVC001 liquidity (i.e. on Sushiswap).\n\nTo simplify the process, decisions within the above constraints would be deferred to the DAO Council, who shall provide reports any time a transaction (or series of transactions) is made.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1622574000, "end": 1622746800, "snapshot": "12550339", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1FEC6e04bC5Db1bcBB29682DC02F2530Ff9B5559", "space": {"id": "svc001.eth", "name": "Stacker Ventures Fund 1"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmcFgrwkqoVi4qYuiwSCcZCw81a9wckD31DYwSZz74DFeu", "voter": "0xa33397FA402E624431ebbb5dA752b7f5A6F6BB36", "created": 1622673852, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "svc001.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWboAxq8Mf2RWGNRtzuqCRHAaoxqZohMyiLV9mCRb9HW8", "voter": "0x60Df8a187Bd4edC720E272f6Ea0d068355Ef39aB", "created": 1622671954, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "svc001.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTTwxejn7v8NLTLsnvywF3BVCedXNsA14TaJTjXmx2YBc", "voter": "0x00610d1b203f9Ddf2776D8729B0de854F5dcE8Ed", "created": 1622661916, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "svc001.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVwCic6hSTLfCa6imnYttb2oyf3akrkU4qPcqsnRAduZC", "voter": "0x8f5f921a30B23a33b84A08CA23D10E5c6054E51F", "created": 1622654541, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "svc001.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWZxXibgUwhhAGgi3tkt9uTNs7Ymy8RETdFBsgDhH8PtY", "voter": "0x0Be9d3deF703eA7EB101445a9e982f296e882f71", "created": 1622585915, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "svc001.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPbVk1kUhhmsYKkqvYmjmJVUU1KVoejVXPRoRQ6RX9FXV", "voter": "0x484A65471112c5e0ec266Bb9a366e81e13306aB4", "created": 1622581519, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "svc001.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTV9pTwBbPdqUWSYsa1S3UiKxCjdzdzsQ2s4iSmNUygDm", "voter": "0x26b567B5EfEB4d1a0482c1a417437FA6bedB0639", "created": 1622575187, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "svc001.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRfoxFpqnReZ697wUaEe4MH8mxPEdPzkGcbxk3QggZz6r", "voter": "0x683231E17F6DB6B4208206164C08e19826bc068A", "created": 1622574857, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "svc001.eth"}}]}
