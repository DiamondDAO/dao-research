It\u2019s success is inevitable let never forget the greatest organizations or empires weren\u2019t built in day. \n\nWhat I\u2019m proposing is simple allocating 51.78 eth to put that money to work and slowly grow the bank. \n\n\nCurrently as we speak 32 ETH can go into staking program today and start producing roughly 1.9 eth yearly with stable return at no risk. \n\nWith the remaining 19.78+ ETH, it should be allocated into these 4 assets at the percentages outlined. \n\n\n40% COMP ( compound.finance)\n25% UNI      ( uniswap.org)\n10% RARI     (Rarible.com)\n25% Filecoin (Filecoin.io)\n\n\nIf this proposal does pass it will come with monthly check up on how the assets are performing and which ones are doing better then others.", "choices": ["Yes ( Start the process)", "No ( Hold Funds in eth )"], "start": 1625126400, "end": 1625212800, "snapshot": "12783358", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6951C974c096fad15D1645076A1782E5A904De8E", "space": {"id": "luckymaneki.eth", "name": "Lucky Maneki"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
