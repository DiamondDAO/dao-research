Instead, we propose to redirect 50% of AMO profits to buyback and distribute FXS to veFXS holders. \n\n\nMotivation\nThis proposal is motivated by lack of incentive for people to vote-lock their FXS. By adding these rewards, community members will be incentivized to participate in protocol governance. \n\nveFXS follows the Curve Finance vote-lock model. veCRV holders currently receive 50% of trading fees from the protocol. At this time, partially due to these incentives, about 50% of CRV supply is vote-locked into veCRV for an average of 3.65 years. We propose to follow a similar reward structure, and hopefully see similar success for the Frax protocol.
