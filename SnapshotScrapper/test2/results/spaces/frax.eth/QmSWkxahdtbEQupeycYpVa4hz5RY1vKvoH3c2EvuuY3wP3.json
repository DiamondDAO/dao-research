A lot of these jars are wrapped+incentivized yearn vaults themselves like crvFRAX. Pickle has expressed interest in staking veFXS to offer its users higher yield on gauge farming pairs. This would expand Pickle\u2019s offering as well as allow them to further incentivize selected gauge pairs with PICKLE. Overall, this seems like a win-win for both protocols if they work together. Essentially, Pickle would like to become the Yearn of FRAX the same way Yearn has an outsize position in veCRV. Since the Pickle community as well as Larry the cucumber are great people, I think that this is a strong addition to our veFXS protocol whitelist.\n\n### For: Add Pickle Finance to veFXS whitelist\n### Against: Do nothing", "choices": ["Add Pickle Finance to whitelist", "Do nothing"], "start": 1629910800, "end": 1630170000, "snapshot": "13098365", "state": "closed", "author": "0xD84c2FDF2F8733A5BbEA65EEC0bB211947792871", "space": {"id": "frax.eth", "name": "Frax"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUiVpoftUAdHaW92GgPrmdWbX98pX9DKigZycb39vnBe7", "voter": "0x8a07Fa8Afa2C54Bc47Da559A0ab4bc15b43Bc897", "created": 1630160816, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frax.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNPnhXrS6sKAFjGNMNJFr2wWGr4ThnAZwM5X62DDKKZWs", "voter": "0xF75e32eea34Ec4c326F340f26E9C7F0CDe69CB02", "created": 1630156322, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frax.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVqKQCfwdCMnB2JdD9CWFQriifbfjRPbMmADkcpPbASC4", "voter": "0xb1417C3a3D10102E57bc123827B942fB60DcA1E4", "created": 1630096592, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frax.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZdirfd27WyCcTKgc622pB5oBFSvjVqkR4kdw8VuJoJGc", "voter": "0x87edd1AA75af9f9677908e286f405a124785E7ED", "created": 1630043720, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "frax.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXqdXa9eykHST5ddCSss1c3tWQ2iC4sC4LJ3kwVe95oEB", "voter": "0x9de9fBc5DFa267610e7d8ba137FB4fe18cE39900", "created": 1629957242, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frax.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSKrwE5wdndkX2QtNzjyyszgZ4Fuks3SqnD8SyAiWDbkH", "voter": "0x95861c41E7767Dc737bca90b175AD51e5F7B9ADA", "created": 1629949710, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frax.eth"}}]}
