Externally owned accounts may generate veCRV as they wish, but smart contract accounts must be whitelisted in order to be able to generate veCRV votes and participate in Curve governance [source](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-dao-contracts/blob/master/contracts/VotingEscrow.vy#L190). The whitelisting process is unrelated to normal Curve listing, and we are unsure at what point we can get whitelisted. As a result, we propose to move all of the Frax metapool LP tokens to a team-controlled EOA to get the 2.5x boost on CRV yields on the Frax gauge as a voter, and lock the farmed CRV for more veCRV to vote for higher Frax gauge weights. Our updated Curve AMO contract implementation that supports this logic can be found [here](https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-solidity/blob/master/contracts/Curve/CurveAMO_V2_Non_Impl.sol)\n\n\n**If adopted**, this proposal seeks to:\n1. Move the metapool LP tokens to the Frax Investor Custodian EOA from the updated Curve AMO\n2. Deposit the LP tokens into the FRAX gauge to receive a boost in CRV yields\n3. Vote-lock the CRV yields for veCRV\n4. Use the veCRV to vote for higher Frax gauge weights\n\nThis **benefits Frax** as a whole by:\n* Increasing Frax gauges by voting for them with the CRV generated by the metapool LP tokens\n* Boosting the CRV generated by the metapool LP tokens", "choices": ["Yes", "No change"], "start": 1620149400, "end": 1620408600, "snapshot": "12375531", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1e84614543Ab707089CebB022122503462AC51b3", "space": {"id": "frax.eth", "name": "Frax"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
