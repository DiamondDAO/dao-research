Making FIP\u2019s that the community agrees with and passes are vital to the continued existence of the protocol and should be encouraged.\n\n## Motivation \nAt present there is no incentive for making Frax improvement proposals - FIP-9 fixes this.\n\nYes: Authors of passing FIP\u2019s be rewarded with a bounty of $500 USD worth of FXS from the community fund and a unique NFT bearing the FIP number. \n\nNo Change: Do not create rewards for successful FIP authors at this time.", "choices": ["Yes", "No Change"], "start": 1622487600, "end": 1622833200, "snapshot": "12546352", "state": "closed", "author": "0xD84c2FDF2F8733A5BbEA65EEC0bB211947792871", "space": {"id": "frax.eth", "name": "Frax"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmfRC24vFtwnHTxDpciiBA9H2GebKKHZpXXFxzhrXGJ8Nh", "voter": "0x6ef13909698e4b287aB35A39088f0E7A57588C22", "created": 1622754405, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "frax.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUjdLR8dbphRbeuTabFADq6WhYbTGiedKUQbhb2b3ty43", "voter": "0x87edd1AA75af9f9677908e286f405a124785E7ED", "created": 1622722804, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "frax.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYEv6hWwXLrsFK2u3TknL9GgMu7P9WCHwW7iGvFQA3pwi", "voter": "0x169787961b393d800AfAfc0B9927088Dc84d692B", "created": 1622617885, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frax.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbU4vY8DSjqX3heCXG8SGsNT6EmZfojwkuiqNHXPNiyjx", "voter": "0x76Da9F88e63a85Ba8BFA19F3821D5A271753D3dc", "created": 1622602234, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frax.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNQD5UjTC2A4oqd1AWyMcw1DuqAhtXj6G3n9E3hipBV35", "voter": "0x8593B031D147cB86824BA55DaCC7625A9D446bcF", "created": 1622523866, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frax.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNyfAy98mdaCXPjb33VjCAaFvMvhCjDDRdWKnykmAWo7P", "voter": "0xD84c2FDF2F8733A5BbEA65EEC0bB211947792871", "created": 1622521485, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frax.eth"}}]}
