Without liquidity, there can be no users, and without users, there's no volume.\n\nFor this to change, we need to be able not only to attract people to the telegram group but to maintain and nurture them so they use app.\n\nI've studied MFI's telegram chat since March 20, and there are several recurrent subjects:\n\n| Word | Number of messages |\n| --- | --- |\n| Price | 785 |\n| Marketing | 674 |\n| Team | 596 |\n| Presale | 345 |\n| Market cap | 105 |\n| Partners and Partnerships | 92 |\n| Investors | 92 |\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, marketing is the second most significant concern for the community, right after price.\n\nThese numbers align with the controversial (50-50 vote) proposal made on October 18. This proposal suggested that 50% of the fees should be used for buybacks (for price) and 20% of the MFI to be invested in marketing.\n\n# Lack of communication\n\nMFI has been unable to attract enough people to join and grow the community. This is primarily due to the lack of constant, proactive efforts in communication and community management. \n\nRecently, we've seen people leaving the telegram group after asking for basic information and either not getting any reply or not being satisfied with the clarity of the answer, even calling the project a scam. This has happened with team-related details, but also with price and marketing. \n\nOne could propose to hire a community manager that will politely return to these people with straight answers. Not only would this person have to answer the most tedious and repeated questions, but they would also regularly update the community about what is proven the community cares about: price, marketing, and team.\n\n# Scalable communication \n\nThe problem with hiring a community manager is that not only it's a fixed cost, but they also can only be available during a humanly possible schedule.\n\nFor this reason, I propose the development and deployment of a community bot.\n\nThis bot should give generic but satisfactory replies to the most common subjects. These would be the available commands:\n* /price - returns MFI price based on the different exchanges;\n* /team - provide team information;\n* /links - medium, reddit, twitter, discord, telegram, github links;\n* /marketcap - returns current MFI marketcap;\n* /supply - returns the circulating and max supply;\n\nAdditionally, we might create aliases like /mkt for /marketcap, /circulating to /supply, and so on.\n\nThe team will develop the bot with public information; however, to improve the messages, the original core team should create a document including:\n* Team - Name, relevant social profiles, and short bio (1 or 2 sentences);\n* Partnerships - Relevant names, dates, URLs, and roles;\n* Investors - List of presale investors, how much they invested and for how much;\nand share that document with the community.\n\n# Deployment\n\nThe development team will deploy the bot in a test group, open to everyone.\n\nAfter being tested for a couple of days, the admins of the groups \"Marginswap Protocol\" and \"MarginSwappers\" should add the bots to the groups, giving it the necessary privileges to function perfectly.\n\nThe code will run inside a docker container, ensuring portability and easy, reproducible deployment.\n\n# Fees\n\n## Development\n\nI have a development team ready for the development and deployment of this bot. \n\nThe work is estimated to take one/two weeks to complete, from gathering project information and APIs, formalizing the work and deployment.\n\nThe bot would cost 4191.63 USDC, to be transfered to 0xd1579377f33a830Cb226b7a9dB6ab85285565acd.\n\nThe USDC should come from the collected trading fees as a part of a marketing effort.\n\n## Hosting\n\nThe development team will share the code publicly on Github after payment. They will also host the bot for the first two months, giving plenty time for the core team to deploy it on MarginSwap's infrastructure. \n\nIf required, the community might vote to extend this period through another proposal.", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1634900400, "end": 1635073200, "snapshot": "13467499", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6e0e75B64010da83bA46A18e4cFD7BeCC23401Ba", "space": {"id": "marginswap.eth", "name": "Marginswap"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRviXj9ZqHU2QznDQmrwCB4vNQnEKMBGnHJcZcAkHjZWZ", "voter": "0xB124C2E19B7De50dB658E899d5EcF0A88DC6D99C", "created": 1634988387, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "marginswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZbjuG4TeLCiMGcnGgJrUQT4NJZoNzpLz2mL5v49MMhJr", "voter": "0xB20354100dA748446Ee8F821c4e0A8d6DdFA2a07", "created": 1634988274, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "marginswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXoscWEwPwpqjVrNv5Nkykxpvpx2TS2mwutt5iRB6TJmc", "voter": "0x9125C8f8876494DaBE0c4F0f911031AC1bf6696a", "created": 1634978218, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "marginswap.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbbta3nGdGxuizkzmtpG7vAEjDfXa3J66BVu9zWNbdvhQ", "voter": "0xd1E550C9Da2cB74CcF3AC6dd9a49D1b51b7a0a83", "created": 1634969641, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "marginswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPEzb1aXMdPhFPpxjBoE3cauwCrU3dvPZQMqc5Q52qQuj", "voter": "0x7d636a0Cb8dF3ae13fB6D838481A7399D382Ee49", "created": 1634934559, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "marginswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNdNmc8soZ2PvKzFtroYQzQWTC2T7pE3k77Xhnv5PTz4d", "voter": "0xeb959Caad3BB6e28BA3D9312A8a7cE745767249D", "created": 1634909175, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "marginswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXadqjCf2k8FwsczT3bCH5gdEBYkUtiANtp66L2Moue1B", "voter": "0x6e0e75B64010da83bA46A18e4cFD7BeCC23401Ba", "created": 1634908901, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "marginswap.eth"}}]}
