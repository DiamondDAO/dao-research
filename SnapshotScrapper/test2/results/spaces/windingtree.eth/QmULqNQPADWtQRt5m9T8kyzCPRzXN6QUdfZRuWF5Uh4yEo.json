You may observe that I'm more known as \".\" in the Telegram - busy holding the team to account, exceedingly honest with my feedback, and following best security principles.\n\nIt was I who was emphatic about the need for the upgradeability to be under very strict security parameters - with control of that capability firmly outside the hands of a a team who are known to one another that may present a potentially malevolent force.\n\nI shall rename my account on Telegram to mfw78, and you are free to ask me questions there. My interests are aligned with yours - I've been here since ICO, actually have increased my stake since initially purchase. I'm an active developer in smart contracts and have assisted members of the community to recover LIF tokens from wallets that have been less than receptive given the reduced ERC20 compliance of the current token.\n\nI look forward to working with the community to ensure the safety, and strict ethical compliance of this upgradeability. You can be assured I will discuss any upgradeability with the community, and provide you all with feedback - extremely direct, honest, and at often times, brutal. That's my pledge to you.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1632218400, "end": 1632779940, "snapshot": "13268930", "state": "closed", "author": "0xE618050F1adb1F6bb7d03A3484346AC42F3E71EE", "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth", "name": "Winding Tree"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qme7HYfqFEBaBcZZQgXSZHbGcdQd5cjrPQvGPzXEqa91H5", "voter": "0x15B9f66B37bB61D80dFe1b608435b1845bf917EE", "created": 1632601126, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXnr2cPVWKVzmHzVGVYGfBRrojF3NC3AoSHtJZ6MMEzkb", "voter": "0x546a0cB802377153B4fEAe052a5ed14C98B3CC9C", "created": 1632477653, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXtQtm5r2yQAgz21PnyTF4KfY9gRZ9fWXjgsP4VAEwfzp", "voter": "0x52232cFEb58Bf7b6d4E8e767aD3aC232E1497432", "created": 1632425209, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW8KV9tJJHKoHaibaTkbq9rcrQwpNtHJsKJQTecfwmwY8", "voter": "0xc01dA44D90cB7c655b605656bAd8A077D2ed6656", "created": 1632424516, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYxVcY1rhjghbvHyriqMPBwiarhx3YUkmvR4qBNt66K51", "voter": "0xA983D376c9590c8e7bBa8556B3914c194F07D9EA", "created": 1632421762, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeC4DcUffWabiE2KqqqiL2NbNFeCCRNfYqaKoieQGNFwg", "voter": "0x3369aBdA5a53c19bbAb3f52a8713bb3aF3E7992f", "created": 1632421649, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfQ9o6YpogHFqyARtE3ie9ArwnAaRqXNyCtkEjRJKbGha", "voter": "0x68131029980ACDaa510fC988178515D2a9e0F689", "created": 1632298826, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbJ2ZEB5xCCq51whmGakQU7UY1d1jV489HS12S4fQt9vQ", "voter": "0x81ADD34137675F0b27F6305646eAac1c129c5AA7", "created": 1632247178, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNjd8GHKipDiDvkBD8NRZesVJrB92p4xhYpMyo72M5Jry", "voter": "0xcf04f1eB7D9024c519CFb968e15bA01FDe7DBADC", "created": 1632243584, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR8TaqosoKXFzDk7kFe8beSH6B9dHVj23qZgPJ4vH1kpy", "voter": "0xE618050F1adb1F6bb7d03A3484346AC42F3E71EE", "created": 1632224965, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}]}
