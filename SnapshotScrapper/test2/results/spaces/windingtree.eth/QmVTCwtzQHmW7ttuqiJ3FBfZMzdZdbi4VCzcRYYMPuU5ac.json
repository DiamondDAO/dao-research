I have recently changed my name on telegram to NTL. I've been following the project since 2018, active in the group asking questions, and keeping up to date with developments.\n\nFor several years now, I have taken an active interest in Cryptography and Blockchain and what roles they play, as protocols of connectivity. This has evolved DAO\u2019s and Tokenomics, which I also have found a keen interest and understanding in where they can disrupt industries like travel. \n\nYou will see from the group that I like to ask questions about the direction of the project and partnerships. I enjoy keeping up to date on developments in the travel space and where WT aligns. I have been eager to share research, ideas and help shape the portal in the ambassadors, plus main group and would continue this deep dive, exploratory approach. Any updates that are put forward I would ensure puts the community first, and more importantly is for the benefit of the travel organisations that will utilize.\n\nIt would be a privilege to represent and be a voice of the community. We all want the same thing, and I would ensure that the right DAO principles and Tokenomics are adhered to and scrutinised, on the journey to mass adoption. Feel free to ask me any questions in the group or pm.\n\nThanks, and cheers to the future of Winding Tree\n", "choices": ["YES", "NO"], "start": 1632218400, "end": 1632779940, "snapshot": "13277998", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB41B40bB2F11E43De9bD98773b5264b60Ca80e33", "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth", "name": "Winding Tree"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYR6FKH99GThBMSr8zXBW8F6wgfgcMpYKiviENFPhU5wu", "voter": "0xB41B40bB2F11E43De9bD98773b5264b60Ca80e33", "created": 1632734513, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYL5yhRU48X1PreUqQhQ2m1EeGhZ3kUhwU7sZKKmGrLQm", "voter": "0x117364C0211CE57F4f732FAd850f06777d444C56", "created": 1632637749, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNg5fTzWhVDpT2KfS6DhFAGvbBxMLn5rNvCcsVD3CkYBX", "voter": "0x52232cFEb58Bf7b6d4E8e767aD3aC232E1497432", "created": 1632421886, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYe3vh8JNTX2qfPmiDYzWZuCi4dYLcYrkj4ZuD3mUuEHW", "voter": "0x5B9233E8a366d3B4b1654Db7a6A3dDd45D1876Ab", "created": 1632410489, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZcVP9ShC7aS9kpRTy2z4U7KW46ngFpdTM2pzKJN3QfGx", "voter": "0xE618050F1adb1F6bb7d03A3484346AC42F3E71EE", "created": 1632400022, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf7Bew9cDuSFq7qhBmZFmQxJVwKYFx3fxCSGQ9Z7HcD5s", "voter": "0x4F4538e2553C61BCE747f73C5fE8133D4B383Dda", "created": 1632386426, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXZCQaUmvZy6GSdhhf3nQFRaR5irHG8draDRoz81DKMiW", "voter": "0xcf04f1eB7D9024c519CFb968e15bA01FDe7DBADC", "created": 1632385071, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "windingtree.eth"}}]}
