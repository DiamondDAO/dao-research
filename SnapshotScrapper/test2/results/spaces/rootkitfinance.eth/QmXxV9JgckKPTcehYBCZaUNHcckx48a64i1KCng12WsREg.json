Our goal remains to eventually be on every possible chain that our code base works on. This vote is for sentiment only and there is no guarantee the results of this vote will be implemented.\n \nSome people have stated concerns that launching on other chains makes it seem like we are moving on. This is not the case, our system is designed to always be expanding. The best evidence of new projects helping old ones can be seen on the rootkit reaction to the UPBNB launch, both price and volume went way up.\n \nEach chain we consider going to has different factors and benefits for us.\nOptions:\n- MATIC: offers fast and cheap transactions and they're in a strong position to see a lot of activity in the near future.\n- ETC: just saw a huge price rise, so launching on that chain would let us jump on the already existing social hype that comes from people making gains.\n- TRON: has a leader with a great smile who will definitely push our bags up. Tron's been around a long time, and since we're not a scam coin, there's a good chance Justin will come through for us!\n- FTM:  it's only a few buttons to launch there and it's a top 100 coin, and I actually know someone who used it in real life.\n", "choices": ["MATIC", "ETC", "TRON", "FTM"], "start": 1621105200, "end": 1621558800, "snapshot": "12429443", "state": "closed", "author": "0x804CC8D469483d202c69752ce0304F71ae14ABdf", "space": {"id": "rootkitfinance.eth", "name": "Rootkit Finance"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPXCj41SpfwittoPckYTPBwq7eQEEYpR4JjawCeQhaJQ2", "voter": "0xf5131764EA4dCbc70363C4393006BC2959f8Bd92", "created": 1621300806, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rootkitfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmaov4zbreaecggHjQeokpQHQwcBRyNW8msKv9Yxs3dGaD", "voter": "0x154Ed1518027A26536905a2c4551956d6203BBf3", "created": 1621286871, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rootkitfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWqhA6D5zQ9esTinoe2jPCxFpJh2ZEjnw2SELf7RCSk15", "voter": "0x77aCACd64F304EBbf8783a33211D5cB7E4363d47", "created": 1621282513, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rootkitfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXh4t5C1bLMnhRf6nSFStSE1TPLu6pGDx92EbMQA3wqgT", "voter": "0xD1EDfeA03C20Be9CC9a87aaffdeC174A0C39a5c0", "created": 1621207253, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rootkitfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWKkwCPVAiZv7yoay14JpU1va5LNBgzUPoptDaYQpjSde", "voter": "0x94Ae267f4780ab8B7eC405CCb90BF423e30a2AED", "created": 1621179215, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rootkitfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme8WWMhLy7JtVzeurpZ3R9KMBRZbdAtYEtj6TL43Yj68B", "voter": "0xbE6A09128934F593D5B9613B2402f9Af65648AfB", "created": 1621155908, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "rootkitfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTvoUAUHDLjfKkBESYeJ4H4ZVD3ejTHiixHRmkxjdvdQD", "voter": "0x1200Eb4fA3dF9903fC6EfF1d7A4a5D17502329b2", "created": 1621112452, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rootkitfinance.eth"}}]}
