This was to make sure the Wearables were compatible and able to work in world as well as having a quality control to make sure the collection was wanted in world ny the community.\n\nNow they have removed the DAO Vote from the process. Without a vote by the community the ecosystem will be flooded by collections of wearables. Some issues that could arise from a lack of quality control and moderation:\n\n- Low effort wearables (single image on a plane t-shirt)\n- wearables with no community interest\n- Major drop in value for all wearables\n- flooded marketplace with low demand\n\nArtist should be able to express their creativity and fashion without destroying or disrupting the ecosystem. There also should be interest for new collections and not just collections being minted because one person wants a shirt or other wearable. Fees for minting a collection can only do so much for moderation. If anything it only prices out artist.\n\nSo I call for a vote on whether or not new wearable collections should have a DAO vote before being minted.\n\nHappy to hear feedback or other ideas on the forum as there is always more ways to solve an issue.\"\n\nShould the DG DAO vote YES or NO on this proposal?", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1622919600, "end": 1623178800, "snapshot": "12588316", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E42f33749A9CbBE7AfA732191BB4C282a3866C2", "space": {"id": "decentralgames.eth", "name": "decentral.games"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSSyVe4gauCwXTt495o4GrrG16Dzs6dJccvtr1iBFw8Gm", "voter": "0x65562b673896B1C62e4b2429A9A91C1F010B8977", "created": 1623176372, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentralgames.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX9E8vvE6jYFFS22rhtHJhQPUEJMJEamiHXh5pTTQcZFr", "voter": "0x3c3F755aeF3DDF2829dC577C17205De21FfcdB59", "created": 1623173392, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentralgames.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSXnckvvKMu6gRRyQQRZkWEk3kjq5cjgGyD35WZsRoDir", "voter": "0x6A96E5f0DeA7490411D84D5f0FAB3b518B224D71", "created": 1623168308, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "decentralgames.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRbvXmXzYBqCvhBsomwxjAfJ6U6ScBcdZ5X4WANqGLPrA", "voter": "0x7e5DCA041b0E91Af20142aE96081EEc9D73d2af9", "created": 1623125321, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentralgames.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW3YRcUazcusCniBANAPusgN2XziNoPAEgx8DR5GgX7ZG", "voter": "0x90c878CE39208E58477EE6BF4ba1c8B24d9b361A", "created": 1623113912, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "decentralgames.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYBAZuYush9pxAZZaaTR8kdd5iGMDZHAK15VDDhMfP3H8", "voter": "0xa1614C4DECbfA292d35021C03dA1eb4DedC06384", "created": 1623102945, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentralgames.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSABsj7ufbG1WqGQrNeVhygheWztauHy6WCFQe9vsTrCg", "voter": "0xb3Ab3a2f58a7d91Fe3Dcf9ABAd53C0dD1603B847", "created": 1623090825, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentralgames.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVXVy5SYWKKk5RaaHJ6X9bYvGvLG8EGbGQQ4yK4mTpvQX", "voter": "0x3fB38CEe8d0BA7Dcf59403a8C397626dC9c7A13B", "created": 1623087090, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentralgames.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWLkknXM9C5a3GPX5affwwtgY56VuhWzrwbTpLytxmkAJ", "voter": "0x8d1bF34397D31903320AC0a8Fee81B3bB7531537", "created": 1623082515, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "decentralgames.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbksnpiK51bhfT86tMPoCDWHW4Ake67Qjy425tLEDeJ33", "voter": "0x5E42f33749A9CbBE7AfA732191BB4C282a3866C2", "created": 1623081494, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentralgames.eth"}}]}
