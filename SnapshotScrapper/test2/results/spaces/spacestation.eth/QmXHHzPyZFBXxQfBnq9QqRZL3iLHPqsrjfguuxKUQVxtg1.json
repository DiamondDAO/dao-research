", "body": "SS DAO\u2019s Axie scholarship program for DAO members  \n\nOverview: (Cost 0.4 ETH per scholar = 0.8 ETH) \n\n2 DAO members have expressed interest in being the scholars for the DAO. A scholar is one who benefits from borrowing the axies that are purchases by the DAO and agrees to give 50% of their earned SLP in exchange for usage of the axies. The DAO will retain full control of the axies (nfts) and the ability to transfer of all tokens including SLP. The scholar is expected to meet the daily quota set forth by the DAO. In return for the services, the DAO will agree to facilitate and transmit the appropriate compensation to the scholar. To fund the 2 scholars, it will cost about 0.8 ETH. Optimal time to capture a 100%+ ROI (0.8 ETH becomes 1.60 ETH) would be approximately 6-8 months depending on the scholar\u2019s performance and ability to learn the combat mechanics and if the axies maintain the same price (not increasing or decreasing) along with the market value of SLP.\n\nWhy?\n\nThis will give DAO members a great opportunity to learn about the most popular play to earn games in the industry. Axie Infinity has yet to capture a larger market within the entire gaming sector. Currently there are over 1 million daily active users. The growth of Axie Infinity is remarkable and being able to gain the perspective of a player/scholar will provide invaluable insight for the DAO. \nUnlike other investments, this investment will generate monthly income for the scholar and the DAO. The DAO will retain the full control of the axies which can be sold for ETH when the time comes and capture a monthly income by selling the SLP that scholar earns. \n\nHow does this work?\n\nScotty will create the scholar account and DAO\u2019s account. Scotty will be in charge of payment to the scholars and the DAO. Multi sig wallets are not compatible with Ronin Wallet. Each account needs a metamask wallet and a ronin wallet. The axies will be bought on the DAO\u2019s account. The DAO account will gift each scholar account with 3 axies. The scholars will begin to play once they are given the QR code and download Sky Mavis (client for the game). The scholar is expected to earn at least 75 SLP per day (this is literally the bare minimum). After 1 month, the SLP will be collected on both scholar accounts and sent to the DAO\u2019s main account. The DAO account will bridge over the SLP back into ERC-20 SLP. The DAO account will send both scholars their share of the SLP according to their performance. The DAO account will keep its share of SLP and has the option to swap the SLP for ETH or USDT to place back into the DAO Treasury.(edited)\n\nCost? \n\nThe initial cost will be the investment itself. The typical price to fund each scholar is about 0.33 ETH (~$1100). We will incur 2 gas fees on the Ethereum Network but once those are completed, we will be on Axie\u2019s L2 called Ronin. Within the Ronin sidechain, users are granted 100 free transactions per day. The final cost will be incurred when the scholars and the DAO are being paid. 1 Ethereum tx will be needed to bridge the SLP from Ronin back into the Ethereum network (ERC-20). Another 2 Ethereum tx will be used to send the scholar and the DAO their share of SLP. This is assuming the DAO wishes to hold the SLP. Another Ethereum tx will be needed if it is decided the SLP needs to be swapped into ETH or USDT. The DAO account will absorb the gas transactions for payments to the scholar. \n\nRisks? \n\nThe price of SLP will be the most influential aspect of this. The all time high for SLP was around 33 cents. Current market price is 17.5 cents. The scholars do not have permission to withdraw SLP or any of the axies (nfts) because they are only given a QR code which grants them permission to play the game. The price of the axies that will be bought will be near the floor price so there is not a huge risk of a large draw down, however, the market can determine said axie is worth less and potentially drop the floor price. If the scholar is found to be in violation of using multi accounts (ie playing 3 accounts on multiple devices) then they risk getting their account ban which will lead to the NFTs getting locked. There is no appeal system in place, so we lose the NFTs. The servers have a potential to crash if there is a sudden influx of users. However, the servers have undergone an upgrade back in March. Worst case scenario is that axie infinity implodes and everything will go to $0. There are no guarantees in any market. \nScholar accountability \n\nWe have members in the DAO who will aid the scholars in learning and give guidance to help them achieve higher SLP outputs. Scholar will be expected to at least earn 75 SLP per day. Scholars will be expected to seek help if it is needed as this is a learning experience. The scholar understands the time commitment they will need to incur to satisfy the agreed upon terms between the DAO and Scholar. The Scholar will be expected to understand Axie Infinity\u2019s rules and do their best to not get banned somehow? (ask me for more info if it is needed)\n\nScholar accountability \n\nAll scholars will be given a quota after their first week. This quota is set to at least 75 SLP per day. \n\nWe have members in the DAO who will aid the scholars in learning and give guidance to help them achieve higher SLP outputs.
