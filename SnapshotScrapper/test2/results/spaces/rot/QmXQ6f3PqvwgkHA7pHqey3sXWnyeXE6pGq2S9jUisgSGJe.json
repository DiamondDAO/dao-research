ROT strikes a balance that we should test, especially with the latest emissions cut.\n\nWhere we really need help is in bringing more new money (and volume) to the project. With enough volume, the tokenomics of ROT really starts to shine.\n\nOne way to bring in more volume is via an exchange listing. If that's something you'd like to help with - please vote here: https://vote.rottenswap.org/#/rot/proposal/QmPKaiVk8t3yEU7dDLENpmVeykw7jdJ2J7BqWUGfGQTuN2\n\nAnother way to bring more volume to the project is with more marketing. Like the exchange listing - this would be a community-funded effort.\n\nFunding would be directed to social media platforms with the ability to target users interested in cryptocurrency. Hit them with our best memes, and best introductions to the ecosystem (via the medium article, other community-written articles, videos, etc.). \n\nFunds would be sourced via a crowd funding platform, with invoices from social media platforms and videos exploring reach / engagement dashboards as deliverables.\n\nThe vote here is to gauge community interest and commitment levels.
