{"id": "QmNyUyP6fWXwzEmMLjCFF4sdWWS3Vj1VKnU84iAEgaBmpk", "title": "Emergence Project - Initial Burn", "body": "What:\nThis is a vote to determine whether Fingerprints DAO will help to incubate a sub-DAO known as \"Emergence DAO''. We are voting on whether Fingerprints DAO will commit to (1) use ETH to purchase Frams (Framergence NFTs) and donate these to the initial Emergence DAO burn, and (2) assist Emergence DAO with its ongoing curation and operation. In return, Fingerprints DAO will receive a stake in Emergence DAO in proportion to the number of Frams donated.\n\nWhy:\nThis is a way for Fingerprints to have a stake in the Emergence generative artwork, given that it fits our Curatorial Statement, mainly in 2.Programmability and 3.Community. Instead of buying pieces in the open market, it's possible to generate additional value through community building and then taking advantage of the burn-to-mint mechanism, which is built into the Framergence project.\n\nFurther, the ability to build as a group is more powerful than building as an individual, so the resulting artwork would be more meaningful. We can leverage this concept to play the meta-game: creating a community of stakeholders around one or more pieces, enforcing our curatorial values. This is also an opportunity to test and expand a little bit the scope of Fingerprints, bringing novel community, curatorial and economic models.\n\nCurrent Structure:\nBased on a vote in #emergence-project in the Fingerprints Discord, we have decided to focus on Frams for our initial collection to give us a solid foundation to later expand on. The process for building this initial collection is as follows:\n\n\"Interested community members contribute Frams to be burned, with each contributed piece being equal to 1 \u201cvote\u201d in the future collection (1 Fram = 1 Vote). Once the contribution period for Frams has ended, all Frams will be burned regardless of rarity, traits, or aesthetics. The community will decide based on aesthetics which Frams received after burns should be kept, and which to burn to re-roll. From there, we build our foundation around this narrative of how the collection was generated and curated, which will be equally as valuable as the pieces in the collection.\"\n\nWe are now in the phase where we are seeking the aforementioned interested community members to make commitments to donate Frams for this initial burn. Once commitments have closed, we will begin discussions on the initial structure of the Emergence DAO (tokenomics, multi-sig, etc.) and be reaching out to members that have expressed a commitment.\n\nCurrent Status:\nAs of this proposal, there are commitments for a total of 47 Frams from 21 contributors. Current contributors are comprised of members from the Emergence community as well as Fingerprints members, including:\nAdinalini\nantmn\nArihz (creator of Framergence and Pulsquares)\nbamboo\nbillwilliams\nCryptospenguin\nDeafbeef\nDT | Luiz\nEskalexia\ngrunt\nJacamar\nJez\nproper\nRantumbits\nRingalls\nStaystacced\nStrongHands\nturtlehaze\nYeo\nzarkem\n0xBEW\n\nVoting options:\nNo: do not support Emergence DAO\nYes, 10 ETH: support Emergence DAO through purchasing and donating Frams to the value of 10 ETH (~0.2% treasury)\nYes, 20 ETH: support Emergence DAO through purchasing and donating Frams to the value of 20 ETH (~0.4% treasury)\n\n----------------\n\nBackground: \u201cEmergence\u201d is the name of the collective projects released by the pseudonymous Brazilian programmer Arihz. At the time of this writing, these projects include Framergence (released March 20, 2021) and Pulsquares (released May 14, 2021).\n\nFramergence: Framergence was the first deflationary NFT project. They are black and white generative NFTs, and the original total supply was 1000 Frams. Framergence makes use of a burn mechanism whereby holders can burn up to 9 pieces at a time to receive N-1 freshly minted pieces back. So for example, if you burned 8 Frams (note: they are truly burned), you would receive back 7 Frams with completely new traits and appearances. Due to this burn mechanism, as well as burn-to-compose as described below, the current total Framergence supply is 767.\n\nPulsquares: Pulsquares is the second generative release under Emergence, with an initial total supply of 500. Unlike Frams, Puls include both color and animation. The release of Pulsquares introduced the concept of \u201cburn to compose\u201d whereby Frams and Puls could be burned into a Pulsquares piece to add a constellation to it. It also introduced the idea of a gallery, where holders can lend their Puls to the Gallery contract and put it on display. After 4 months in the gallery, the Puls will acquire a constellation. Constellations, whether acquired by burning or through the gallery, appear as black orbs that move around the border of the piece. Adding at least 1 constellation also enables the piece to have a custom name. As a result of this burn to compose mechanism, the current total Pulsquares supply is 478.\n\n\n", "choices": ["No", "Yes, 10 ETH", "Yes, 20 ETH"], "start": 1625673600, "end": 1625846400, "snapshot":
