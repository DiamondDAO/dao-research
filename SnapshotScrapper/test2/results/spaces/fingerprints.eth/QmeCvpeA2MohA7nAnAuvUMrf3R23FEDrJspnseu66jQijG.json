If we fail to gather the amount required to form the pool from members, we can partner with liquidity providing DAOs.\n\n**Meebits NOT included in this proposal:**\nElephant #4922\nElephant #5214\n10-trait #14368\n ", "choices": ["Yes, create the pool", "No, keep these Meebits"], "start": 1619881200, "end": 1619974800, "snapshot": "12441977", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1Aa43AdC6625e664a16821c89C88d581d05E4266", "space": {"id": "fingerprints.eth", "name": "Fingerprints DAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
