{"id": "QmTsdUfB6f3unx89Ph1uZq2pez6k6LPwYSAqeHNXYLNvC5", "title": "RAW DAO Bridge Proposal", "body": "## Context\nThe RAW DAO Incubation Proposal snapshot closed last week with Option 5 as winner.\n\nOption 5 involved Fingerprints contributing 253ETH to RAW DAO in return for 12.5% of the tokens of RAW DAO (50% of the outstanding supply). This is confirmed and will take place.\n\nOption 5 also included a footnote: \"in this scenario, Fingerprints **will** purchase 250k tokens at ~2x Phase 0 price (~100ETH), in a bridge round for the DAO to become operational between Phase 0 (formation) and Phase 1.\"\n\nThe proposal was meant to reflect the language \"Fingerprints will **have the right to purchase up to** 250k tokens at 2x Phase 0 price (total of 101.2ETH), in a bridge round for the DAO to become operational between Phase 0 (formation) and Phase 1.\"\n\nThat is, the option should not have committed Fingerprints to the 101.2ETH additional investment at that time, rather given it a call option on the bridge.\n\nRAW is now up and running and is looking to close this 101.2ETH bridge round in short order. RAW is happy to offer the right of first refusal to Fingerprints, as originally intended. Thus, this vote will decide how much of the option Fingerprints will fulfill.\n\n## Voting Options\nOptions are as follows:\n\n1. **Take up none of the allocation.** This will mean Fingerprints contributes a total of 253ETH (approximately 23.8% of current treasury) to RAW and will own 12.5% of RAW tokens fully-diluted.\n\n2. **Take up 25% of the allocation** \u2013 contribute a further 25.3ETH to RAW in return for an additional 0.6% of the tokens. This will mean Fingerprints contributes a total of 278.3ETH (approximately 26.1% of current treasury) to RAW and will own 13.1% of RAW tokens fully-diluted.\n\n3. **Take up 50% of the allocation** \u2013 contribute a further 50.6ETH to RAW in return for an additional 1.3% of the tokens. This will mean Fingerprints contributes a total of 303.6ETH (approximately 28.4% of current treasury) to RAW and will own 13.8% of RAW tokens fully-diluted.\n\n4. **Take up 75% of the allocation** \u2013 contribute a further 75.9ETH to RAW in return for an additional 1.9% of the tokens. This will mean Fingerprints contributes a total of 328.9ETH (approximately 30.7% of current treasury) to RAW and will own 14.4% of RAW tokens fully-diluted.\n\n5. **Take up 100% of the allocation** \u2013 contribute a further 101.2ETH to RAW in return for an additional 2.5% of the tokens. This will mean Fingerprints contributes a total of 354.2ETH (approximately 33% of current treasury) to RAW and will own 15% of RAW tokens fully-diluted.\n\nPlease note:\n\n* This is a ranked choice vote, so please rank your preferences.\n* These bridge round tokens are being transacted at a valuation 2x that of the initial 0.0002024ETH per token, but at a likely discount to Phase 1.
