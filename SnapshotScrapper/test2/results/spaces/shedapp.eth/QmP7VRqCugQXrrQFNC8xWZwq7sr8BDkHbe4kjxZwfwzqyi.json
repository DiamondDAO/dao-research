In return for locking LP tokens in the DAO for 3 months, DAO members will receive HAUS rewards based on the magnitude of their stake. PoolHAUS will be opening its doors to the public until August 7th. Minimum contribution is 10 HAUS/WETH LP Tokens *or* 1.5 xDai WETH.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSince we are staying on xDai for the foreseeable future, supporting the xDai community should be part of\n SHE's backbone. With our upcoming application to UberHaus, we can show further support for our DAO platform by pledging some of the treasury to the HAUS token At the same time, we will be receiving HAUS in return for our support, which is a win-win if we are bullish on the state of HAUS token. \n\nHere are the reward allocation from the article:\n\n> - Over the 3 month period, 2500 HAUS will be issued to PoolHAUS, these rewards will be distributed proportionally based on contributions. These rewards can also be increased by UberHaus if decided by the DAO.\n> - WETH contributors to PoolHAUS are given higher rewards than LP contributors; an additional 825 HAUS will be distributed pro-rata.\n> - These additional rewards will be airdropped to WETH contributors at the end of PoolHAUS.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis is the first Iteration of PoolHaus. Participating could lead to more collaborations between HAUS and PRTCLE in the future. DAOHaus has built a great platform and given an opportunity to mutually benefit between our DAO\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nHere are the requirements from the article:\n\n> - Contributors will pledge a minimum of 10 WETH/HAUS LP tokens from Swapr, or 1.5 WETH to the DAO. Every 100 DAO shares (Loot or Gov) will represent 1 WETH/HAUS LP token or 0.15 ETH.\n> - Contributions will be open for a one week window; During which LP tokens & ETH contributions will be pegged at the start of the PoolHAUS contribution window.\n> - PoolHAUS will hold its LP position in the minion for 3 months, meaning contributors won\u2019t be able to Ragequit (claim) their LP tokens back from the DAO before this 3 month period ends (Unless otherwise voted by the DAO).\n\nIt seems as though a community member @yalormewn is willing to donate their HAUS tokens to this cause, with promise of return reward after the 3 months. Yalor offered to pledge 1k HAUS (currently $16651.2) with the promise it is returned at the end of the 3 month period. This opens up more options for SHE\n\nThere are a few monetary options. It makes sense to pledge LP Tokens since an extra 825 HAUS will be given to LP pledgers over WETH pledgers\n1. Don't pledge to POOLHaus\n2. Pledge the minimum 10 LP Tokens (no community)\n3. Pledge $10,000 worth of LP Tokens (no community)\n4. Match 1k Haus from Yalor (currently $16651.2) with WETH\n\nOption 0 - No pledge\nOption 1 - will provide very little reward at the minimum but it is very safe\nOption 2 - gives decent rewards and allows SHE to keep everything that is earned,\nOption 3 - gives biggest rewards by allowing SHE to utilize Yalor's HAUS pledge, but also requires the largest risk from SHE\n\n\nWe will use a gnosis multisig on xdai controlled by SHE Core to pledge the DAO, since a DAO vote will take too long to make the 1 week pledge window. \n\n## Security Considerations\n\nUsing a Gnosis safe should make the shares secure.\n\nIf we are not feeling bullish on HAUS/xDai, then this would not be smart. We should probably consider a migration to another chain if we don't feel this is a good move. We are wasting time on xDai if we are not open to collaborating with other xDai projects.\n\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n", "choices": ["No pledge to POOLHaus", "Pledge the minimum 10 LP Tokens ", "Pledge $10,000 worth of LP Token", "Match Yalor's 1k Haus"], "start": 1628233200, "end": 1628492400, "snapshot": "17444271", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5A9CE898f0B03c5A3Cd2d0c727efdD0555C86f81", "space": {"id": "shedapp.eth", "name": "Shenanigan"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQeDeSbjUDGGCc2JeHwRmdWfCcWcm99UHhoJDzkFrbguF", "voter": "0x5AB02B12867603bc9F900DcE533aC5C55ED059f8", "created": 1628485370, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "shedapp.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdH3BFz4S1yqehQkAGBgjdGSe5VWTtNZMpgQqnsexwUw3", "voter": "0xe0802Cf223a05A14408Ad44E7F878d21408Fb04C", "created": 1628485278, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "shedapp.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTDNo9rVk6vNFEto5b19WExpB18m3jK5cQxnXx3ehvJab", "voter": "0x219b4B0A498566C412391219Ea3d936176719ca6", "created": 1628484225, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "shedapp.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUsfpuNTp5ExjMPMzxS6j5q7rfoRJk7gZmwLDLmvM8fnB", "voter": "0xa69656dee6721FF43506477Fb522eFef151E4477", "created": 1628481426, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "shedapp.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbu4L2QDnBF5SCvUXy6ih2uLCskTCmQ8z5zzCpcC2EWJ6", "voter": "0x183bDB344A07Ee3D27f07AC4799A56E4A2fE5439", "created": 1628339927, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "shedapp.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYsK5Hi5AfeT3dkebiaXvgvNafxwvhmsKCSrjJJTLwTCb", "voter": "0x106F4d08D0Cc154D63C8F557000372C5E78CAaFe", "created": 1628322677, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "shedapp.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYpuAbD64ScRRrfTgLF56vVvNxKqHfB5M4bwLn8Ywo9yJ", "voter": "0x451248229712D6F207ff9466d8D3A33CB59d103c", "created": 1628309072, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "shedapp.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaWPgXruCn9CXEBSS515KzeamBybhAJ6kk8jGDpedZ3xs", "voter": "0x94db828F971919dff4097E0D8970329CA5B95c1f", "created": 1628264331, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "shedapp.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUo9azsgnyWxx7Y6bM81tE6eSAvWcVvFyJivYAvNYYiVK", "voter": "0x558e1796Deb3b5F94658A6C12bC934F790cD8C2d", "created": 1628254687, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "shedapp.eth"}}]}
