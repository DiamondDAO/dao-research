If our Pre-season was laying the foundations, Season 1 is building the house. Over the next few months, we will establish our position within the Web3 landscape as an incubator of ideas that reflect our Good Growth mission by offering education, expertise and funding. \n\nSeason 1 will start on 1st November 2021 and run for a period of 60 days. Voting will take place through Snapshot using $PRTN and voting will start on the 22nd of October and close on the 25th. All founding members have 20,000 $PRTN to cast their vote. The team has shared this document with the community prior to the vote.\n\n*Below is a slightly stripped back version of the Proposal, [see the full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xBYliPgn1D3fSgSqc7DNivGCWEAtHzCpqoA-OTSQOo0/edit#heading=h.r6f59pxnh2sd)*\n\n---\n### Goals\n\n#### 1.

This proposal will be shared with the Community and led by the core, governance and treasury teams.\n\n---\n\n### Season 1 Roadmap\n\nNOVEMBER\n \n1st - Season 1 Starts \ud83d\ude80\n- Open the
