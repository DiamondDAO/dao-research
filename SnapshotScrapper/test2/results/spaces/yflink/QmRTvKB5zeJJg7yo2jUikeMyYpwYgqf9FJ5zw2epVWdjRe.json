Splits will be annotated as:\n\nTREASURY/STAKED (e.g. 20/80 means 20% to Treasury, 80% to Staked YFL)\n\nThe options below are being kept intentionally broad and will be followed by a second vote with more specific options for the most highly voted category.\n\nAs a reminder, the Stablecoin Treasury currently is capped at $100k USD.\n\n1. No Listing Fee\n\n2. Function of % of Stablecoin Treasury (ST) size relative to cap \n\n* For example, when the ST is at 0% of its cap the split is 100/0. When the ST is at 75% of its cap the split is 25/75. This are many other models to be considered within this category, it does not have to be strictly linear as above.\n\n3. First $X in fees each month/week/etc. go to ST if it is under the cap, where X is some percentage of the ST cap. If the ST capped, some fixed ratio as below.\n* e.g. If X is 20% the first $20k of fees earned are paid into the ST as if the ratio was 100/0. After that 20k is paid, fees are distributed according to a different ratio.\n\n4. Fixed ratio\n* e.g. 20/80, 30/70, etc.", "choices": ["No Listing Fee", "Function of Stablecoin Treasury (ST) Value Relative To Cap", "First $X in fees each month/week/etc. go to ST", "Fixed Ratio"], "start": 1600714800, "end": 1601078340, "snapshot": "10912164", "state": "closed", "author": "0x8188594FC8E266059BaC9B5AE8F1C440f38384E1", "space": {"id": "yflink", "name": "YFLink"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
