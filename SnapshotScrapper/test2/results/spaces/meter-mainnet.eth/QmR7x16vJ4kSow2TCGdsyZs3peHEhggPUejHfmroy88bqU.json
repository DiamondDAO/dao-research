That combined with the price pumping significantly during marketing pushes tells me people are confused about which coin to buy and are buying the first one they see when they start typing in \"MTR\" in various exchanges.\n\nThis is a problem because people will ape in large sums of money into MTR that they will then have to sell at a loss once they realize their mistake.  The fear is that some people will be so frustrated with losing money because of the mistake, that they may decide to not invest in the project at all.\n\nI propose we change the name of MTR to something that will make the difference between the two coins more apparent. \n\nI suggest we change MTR to Joule \u2013 with a ticket of JLE. That was, with completely different tickers, there's no way potential customer can be confused.\n\n", "choices": ["Keep the MTR ticker the same", "Change MTR ticker to Joule (JLE)", "Change ticker to KILO", "Change ticker to SMTR", "Change ticker to something else"], "start": 1629831600, "end": 1630090800, "snapshot": "14884402", "state": "closed", "author": "0xc885536C2B688859C13505f2F076bdfeC204A880", "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth", "name": "Meter Governance MTRG"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWcqTWyduicLskBLKLdiQA8qCViaCQDVDg6gEnkzrZTvT", "voter": "0xc885536C2B688859C13505f2F076bdfeC204A880", "created": 1629960861, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth"}}]}
