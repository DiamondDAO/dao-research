See the list of 8 points below.\n\n----\n\nThe name MTR is very confusing for people that might want to buy into the project but not do a bunch of research \u2013 which is likely most crypto investors. Let's be real: especially for those of us that have been around for a while, we have had more than enough people pop into the telegram channel asking which coin is the one to invest in. In my opinion, a project should NEVER have that problem where people don't even know which coin is the correct one to put their money into. \n\nConsider the following images: https://imgur.com/a/WEu0B0o\n\nIf you were someone that heard about this awesome project called Meter somewhere and were thinking of buying but first wanted to take a quick look at the charts. If they saw those charts above, it seems like even a reasonable person could get confused as to which coin is the correct one to buy. Among the things that might make people think MTR is the investment coin are:\n\n1. MTR has a higher ATH\n2. MTR has better recent price action\n3. MTR has more trade volume\n4. MTR's name is closer to the Meter brand overall\n5. The MTR logo looks more appealing while the MTRG one almost looks fake\n6. MTR comes up before MTRG when you Google \"Meter Crypto\"\n7. MTR is listed as \"Meter Stable\" in several places, but the price action for the coin indicates it is anything BUT stable\n8. With the above in mind, other than having someone explicitly tell you MTRG is the investment coin, or doing more research than most people do, how are people supposed to know MTRG is the investment token? \n\nNow imagine that you were an investor that mistakenly purchased the wrong coin and lost 50% of your investment upon trying to fix your mistake, how would that make you feel? Would you be upset? Could you understand how that might make someone be put off by the project entirely and not even want to invest in the right coin? I could. \n\nWhat's more, every time we have done marketing pushes lately, MTR saw just as much price action \u2013 if not significantly more \u2013 than MTRG. Yes, there could be some complicated explanation for this that isn't people being confused, but with the above 8 points, I don't think it can be discounted that at least SOME of that price action happened because of confusion and not some nefarious party trying to take advantage of misinformed investors. \n\nLook, I don't want to postpone making big bucks as much as the next person. Meter does not have unlimited funds. Going into our biggest marketing push yet, I would want to make sure all our ducks are in a row beforehand. Yes, this means the Voltswap marketing push could be postponed a couple of weeks or even a couple of months, but until this confusion is resolved, we will continue to have people be confused and only get a fraction of the return on investment we would otherwise get from our marketing campaigns. \n\n", "choices": ["Change MTR before VS marketing", "Continue with VS marketing plan"], "start": 1630004400, "end": 1630263600, "snapshot": "14951569", "state": "closed", "author": "0xc885536C2B688859C13505f2F076bdfeC204A880", "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth", "name": "Meter Governance MTRG"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdZj3hmNYxPFhiPPZvnvLc6VzyLU1gb9AKVibDYqbPBWB", "voter": "0xc885536C2B688859C13505f2F076bdfeC204A880", "created": 1630005593, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth"}}]}
