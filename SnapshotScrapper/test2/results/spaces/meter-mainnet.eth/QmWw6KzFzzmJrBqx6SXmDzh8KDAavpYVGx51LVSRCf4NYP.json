Meter Governance holders did not have a say over the recent network upgrade, and it is not clear that we will ever have a say on subsequent network upgrades. It is important for Meter Governance holders to have a say on most or all changes that occur on the network regardless of technical knowledge, political affiliation, etc. I am by no means saying that I disagree with the upgrade, or that I have a distrust for the development team, but I believe voting on this upgrade as well as subsequent upgrades will set a precedent for ensuring a thriving decentralized economy.\n\nBy Voting allow you are voting for the upgrades to Meter Mainnet to be decided through MIP's and to be decided by Meter Governance holders versus being voted only by the dev team.\n\nBy voting disallow you are voting for the upgrades to be decided by the Meter Development team instead of the Meter Governance holders.", "choices": ["Allow", "Disallow"], "start": 1629648000, "end": 1629820800, "snapshot": "14819176", "state": "closed", "author": "0xCE36a6c636AD9511460e80B1751931e1BB4c82aA", "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth", "name": "Meter Governance MTRG"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmcXckZpjKbpA9jxbwybdMAhsJvTB4Pj51S1taoEcJYYYy", "voter": "0x4a179A005DCBE770C6970EE390a43d2284f67527", "created": 1629707072, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUasrV9EkdFwUDEwC6FE1PVUQE1hpwMKY7Q5b3PKNPL9E", "voter": "0x353fdD79dd9A6fbc70a59178d602aD1f020Ea52F", "created": 1629695642, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYNzVneCVZ45WKtoQF767GZz5TG8TP6eLhznmZevJAcTg", "voter": "0xf6959E47b94C82B93867fC876b4c99F37e496897", "created": 1629657973, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSsDEvysizQaYvobXa5VFLFpNJf4k6QgpKxKBk6KNNvKA", "voter": "0xD7C2Edb33B8509E1E7cbAB03E43e38835cf269Ee", "created": 1629657959, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb1zgFgVLMyR7VK3yHU21GjqYuCWQNeBKD1Xky2PZDznD", "voter": "0x3a87eAE486C641820b13A476E67005A455ae7c34", "created": 1629657948, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcRg52jnBuR5otErnxj1xkWKrChp23fHvK2HP36g4J7SR", "voter": "0x927495f329ab083e6Cff350d6E9D8652D76f90f7", "created": 1629657923, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX4y1VXyRRk5a1iAYmcD3AKvBLtawAtpx6baAiGRX5coh", "voter": "0xbB3B5eA29BDA11cbb4cDF9D7623B018e92C7E2Fa", "created": 1629657905, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth"}}, {"id": "QmersefRUv1EFykCNYur61kkZEoz4LVhAfPknJ6MmRfsbE", "voter": "0x20D6016f90cbD05E9d0cA996D9eAaa3a7330315E", "created": 1629657595, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWpgtKPPKYDTKb9WHdMLov2UcHGAMUaipekJqD278RmUi", "voter": "0x0F8684F6dC76617D6831B4546381eb6CFB1C559F", "created": 1629656681, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUxTKKY5YdsmZnoYPZNXmtURXEX9d4fnHEnpnTdyMYpAv", "voter": "0xCE36a6c636AD9511460e80B1751931e1BB4c82aA", "created": 1629656599, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "meter-mainnet.eth"}}]}
