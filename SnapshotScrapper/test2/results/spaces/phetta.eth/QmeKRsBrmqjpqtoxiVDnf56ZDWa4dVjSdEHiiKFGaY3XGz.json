{"id": "QmeKRsBrmqjpqtoxiVDnf56ZDWa4dVjSdEHiiKFGaY3XGz", "title": "Change Cloudy 1/1 Price?", "body": "Hello everyone!\n\nMaybe it's time for a bit more of a serious proposal eh? \n\nCurrently, the main 1/1 for the Phettaverse that is available on the primary market is listed at 2.5 $ETH. \n\nMy main goal with 1/1's part of the Phettaverse is to provide a physical addition of some sort. In Cloudy's case, it comes with an AR-ready metal print and my first ever DIY plush sewed by me that the collector has the option to claim.\n\nHowever, for the non-physical collectors, I have also proposed that the collector of Cloudy and any other future 1/1 NFTs can have the option to propose an edition piece that involves said 1/1 character or story arc.\n\nOnce the edition idea is agreed upon, the edition piece would be listed via my KO account where we share side characters and small edition pieces for Phettaverse collectors to join the universe and family. Once the editions officially sell out the profit would be split with the 1/1 owner as a way to form a return for the Phettaverse collectors. \n\nWe of course have the $NULL token which the primary tool is voting, but we could also hopefully provide a use case for edition holders with the social token.\n\nThis again of course is the early idea that I'd love to slowly push into the idea and universe we have laid out.\n\nThe main proposal for this question of course is regarding Cloudy, with the current price being 2.5 $ETH which has been listed for a month, and the last sale was 2 $ETH. \n\nDo we suggest lowering the price of Cloudy to 2 $ETH as a way to find the 1/1 collector who may want to be the first to start the edition utility of 1/1s? Or leave the price and wait for the right collector.\n\nI'll get better at writing these and be more specific, but any thoughts, please share via discord or here!\n\n", "choices": ["Leave Price", "Change price to 2 ETH", "Declining Price"], "start": 1628276400, "end": 1628622000, "snapshot": "12979471", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2e307Ceab1b4c5F4cAc508E3B13C3dBfe86a3c81", "space": {"id": "phetta.eth", "name": "NULL"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qma9Sq3T8TJEv1SdFDygmjevbafRQprt988iRjYbcp813j", "voter": "0xbf1721AEaD6B5aBDeCa97680D9d3Baf67AA966ba", "created": 1628399457, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "phetta.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUFYgtieuWoAMx6zA9iQWjgeKYqDfW9HxsvBzCRc6tMfh", "voter": "0xe3B1dbf3e1824Ec1A736e977BD5dbe53cDa4548E", "created": 1628380005, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "phetta.eth"}}, {"id": "QmREYHGzA2PgQcsQX1bBA9kLPxtimGLCwsginwh5HYZcTF", "voter": "0x1Ba2A537A771AA4EaC2f18427716557e4E744864", "created": 1628379548, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "phetta.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdXAb2ogcRiNRia9jJRoZz77K91LUqmYsxKaa3w49N9iK", "voter": "0xF968A5de2019dE1F0A8f53758dD137aE5C9EFbC9", "created": 1628366369, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "phetta.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVUbfSyVXGxAr8oUtMQiUpj8zms3FfV8eWCd1SkeFvjUW", "voter": "0x197D9f1370f2f7441a17cb035f33A6C19866D67E", "created": 1628360381, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "phetta.eth"}}]}
