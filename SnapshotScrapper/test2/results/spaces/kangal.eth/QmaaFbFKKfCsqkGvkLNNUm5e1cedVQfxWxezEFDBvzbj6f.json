{"id": "QmaaFbFKKfCsqkGvkLNNUm5e1cedVQfxWxezEFDBvzbj6f", "title": "Re-structure $TEAK tokenomics and DeFi aspect", "body": "1) Keep KANGAL staking with the same APR-M from the last vote, remove the fee for claiming $TEAK, and limit minting $TEAK to this pool. To use in future staking pools with multi-stake, mint same amount for DAO treasury with each claim, which means if a user who stakes KANGAL claims 1M $TEAK as reward, we also mint 1M for treasury to use in all future operations. This means the only way to mint new $TEAK will be staking KANGAL, and other pools will just use the already minted $TEAK. As you know all treasury-related wallets are in the control of the community via DAO.\n\n2) Skip LP pools and work on multi-stake pools in the future.\n\n3) Update website, docs, litepaper, whitepaper in alignment with the overall changes.\n\n4) Allow dev team to use funds from the treasury for audits. We currently have ~1.8 ETH there, and we may need all of it so there will be no fixed amount in the proposal.", "choices": ["Approve", "Reject"], "start": 1623247200, "end": 1623340800, "snapshot": "12600848", "state": "closed", "author": "0x63c67Ba2aa323e47eddDB3952990CF41768a679c", "space": {"id": "kangal.eth", "name": "Kangal"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmbcrjh5bh1D6Kc2W5Y4M4F5Kfj45rwKMkKEHnWVX7NGea", "voter": "0x430Dc70Cf3D77691E088B97863fB4f51D7425055", "created": 1623278785, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kangal.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQHTUsmH2PLBmLXcBdPs7c9tKC3WUGEN7Sq1YPi9nvQVH", "voter": "0x74609F91A2580f2D43bFe9c944c18A3dbE52d877", "created": 1623260756, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kangal.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP8droA3YeGp5ieg5TKmxasUWVPFoLnshT4Lz5pN3bJB8", "voter": "0x299fe93CaA4Bcf2dd0E7aDc46A72a92c0faaEff6", "created": 1623250946, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kangal.eth"}}]}
