As our communities continue to merge, we need a single community DAO to govern the new network. This is the snapshot to support the v2 DAO proposal as amended through community discussion.\n\n(Proposal in Full: https://forum.threshold.network/t/threshold-network-dao-proposal-v2/57)\n\n# Proposal Overview\nThere are two major constituencies in the Threshold network: active stakers and token holders. Both NuCypher and Keep governance today privilege active stakers.\n \nThe proposal for this snapshot is for a bicameral DAO with an elected multisig council to govern the new network, addressing both groups of stakeholders and aligning all participants. The DAO will be a deployment of GovernorBravo, and will give the bulk of governance power to active stakers with some exceptions as outlined in the proposal. \n\nThis proposal is an amended second iteration of the governance system for the upgraded network. Passing this snapshot will move us one step closer to a complete protocol merge.\n\nThe full details of the v2 DAO proposal as well as community discussion can be found on the Threshold Forum: https://forum.threshold.network/t/threshold-network-dao-proposal-v2/57 \n\n# Vote Structure\nThis signal is a binary option, as the community has engaged with the proposal and signalled support. Also understand that the Emergency Security Developer Multisig has been tabled for more discussion - join the forum for more discussion on the ESDM - see FAQ. \n\nThe options are:\n1. Yes, I support the v2 DAO proposal\n2. No, I do not support the v2 DAO proposal\n\nWe kindly request that if you do not vote to support the v2 DAO proposal in this snapshot that you drop a note in Discord explaining your reasoning so that our communities can work together to move forward based on this feedback.\n\n# FAQ\nThere was a decision made by the community to table the Emergency Security Developer Multisig section of the v2 proposal.
