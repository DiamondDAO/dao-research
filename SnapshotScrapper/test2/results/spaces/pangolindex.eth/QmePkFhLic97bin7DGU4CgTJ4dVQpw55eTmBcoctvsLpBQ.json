We should incentivize BNB liquidity to come across the bridge by rewarding BNB pairs.\n\n**Benefits to Pangolin:**\n1. Expanded Token Selection - Pangolin should be expanding its tokens available for trading, particularly the most popular tokens\n2. Trading Volume & TVL - BNB pairs will generate meaningful volume and fees through trading and arbitrage\n3. Attracting New Users - Having BNB available on Avalanche and in Pangolin will attract users and investors from the BSC Network\n\n**About the BNB token:**\nThe BNB token is the #4 largest token by market cap (source: CoinGecko). It is the native gas token on the BSC network, and is also used to pay trading fees on Binance.com\n\n", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1625763900, "end": 1626023100, "snapshot": "2608370", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3B7631F8E3428dEaB77634BF799b622ce412e9Ea", "space": {"id": "pangolindex.eth", "name": "Pangolin"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
