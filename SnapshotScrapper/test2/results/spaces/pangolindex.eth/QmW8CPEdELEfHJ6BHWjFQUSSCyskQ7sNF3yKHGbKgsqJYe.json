{"id": "QmW8CPEdELEfHJ6BHWjFQUSSCyskQ7sNF3yKHGbKgsqJYe", "title": "Proposal for BNB/AVAX and BNB/PNG to Receive PNG Rewards", "body": "I would like to propose that we give short term (3 months duration) PNG rewards to BNB token pairs. BNB/AVAX at 1x multiplier and BNB/PNG at 3x multiplier.\n\nBackground:\nThe BNB token is now available to be bridged from BSC (Binance Smart Chain) to Avalanche through the AnySwap Bridge. We should incentivize liquidity to come across the bridge by rewarding BNB pairs. Also this would greatly streamline the process of bridging assets from BSC to Avalanche since BNB is the most common assets used on BSC.\n\nBenefits to Pangolin:\n\n1. Expanded Token Selection - Pangolin should be expanding its tokens available for trading, particularly the most popular tokens\n2. Trading Volume & TVL - BNB pairs will generate meaningful volume and fees through trading and arbitrage\n3. Attracting New Users - Having BNB available on Avalanche and in Pangolin will attract users and investors from the BSC Network\n4. Streamlined bridge process - BNB is the most common assets that would be used to bridge from BSC to Avalanche network\n\nAbout the BNB token:\nThe BNB token is the #4 largest token by market cap (source: CoinGecko). It is the native gas token on the BSC network, and is also used to pay trading fees on Binance.com.
