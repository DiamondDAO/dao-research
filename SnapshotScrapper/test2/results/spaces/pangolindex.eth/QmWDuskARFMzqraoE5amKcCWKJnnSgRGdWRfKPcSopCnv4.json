(ie. if PNG-SNOB takes up 50% 'share' of AVAX defi platforms, and the rewards bucket is 5%, then half (2.5%) PNG is awarded to the LP pool)\n\nGovernance can dictate which exchanges can be added or removed into the pool. Platforms like SUSHI (which is established) need not be a part of this pool and therefore can be voted to be opted out. Governance can also dictate what size rewards is awarded to this accelerator pool.\n\nThe intent behind this is to help support, create awareness and exposure to other AVAX-based defi platforms which are trustworthy, honest, and innovative in their approach.\n\n", "choices": ["5% distributed to the pool", "4% distributed to the pool", "3% distributed to the pool", "2% distributed to the pool", "1% distributed to the pool", "No distribution"], "start": 1617681600, "end": 1618977600, "snapshot": "1000404", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3E85aDE1E045837d2b32E226140147eE12FAF311", "space": {"id": "pangolindex.eth", "name": "Pangolin"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
