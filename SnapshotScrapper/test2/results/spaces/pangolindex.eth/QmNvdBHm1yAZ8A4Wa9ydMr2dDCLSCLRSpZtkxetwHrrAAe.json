Pangolin\u2019s current ratio of stable-coins is only 3.1% of overall TVL, which is very low compared to other major DEX which have between 18%-26% stable-coins in TVL.\n\n**Benefits of more stable-coin liquidity:**\n1. **Swap volume and revenue**. Stable-coin pairs consistently have high swap volume, and we want to capture the swap revenue from this.\n2. **Supporting lending projects** like BenQi that depend on deep stable-coin liquidity for liquidations. Effective lending solutions are key to growing DeFi on Avalanche\n3. **Low slippage swaps** for users. We can provide lower slippage on swaps if these pairs have more liquidity.\n4. **Attracting new users and projects** into Pangolin over other apps. As new users and projects come to Avalanche, we want them to choose Pangolin over other apps as their primary DEX, and having the most stable-coin liquidity helps Pangolin be the top choice\n\n**Conclusion**\nA higher level of stable-coin liquidity is required for Pangolin to see increased success a DEX, and is also required to support future lending partners. USDT and DAI pairs are generating tremendous volume and add significant utility, so we should increase rewards to attract and keep liquidity in Pangolin.\n\nFor a full analysis, please see this governance post:\nhttps://gov.pangolin.exchange/t/increase-rewards-multipliers-for-stable-coin-pairs/1628\n\n", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1628552700, "end": 1628898300, "snapshot": "2921401", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3B7631F8E3428dEaB77634BF799b622ce412e9Ea", "space": {"id": "pangolindex.eth", "name": "Pangolin"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
