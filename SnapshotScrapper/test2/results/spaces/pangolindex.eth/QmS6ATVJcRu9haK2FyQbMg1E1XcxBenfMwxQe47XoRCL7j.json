Increase the AVAX-PNG from 10x to 12x multiplier. The community has asked for this pair to be the highest weighted.\n\n2. Remove the following low value PNG pools. We are coming up on a technical limitation of how many pools we can add (max is ~80 pools and we are at 65 pools), so we should purge some of the lower value PNG pools.\n\nNative Pairs with under 200 AVAX staked to be removed\nPNG-SHIBX\nPNG-GDL\nPNG-LYD\nPNG-DYP\nPNG-GAJ\nPNG-WALBT\nPNG-TUSD\nPNG-TRYB\nPNG-BNB\nPNG-HUSKY\n\nNon-native Pairs with under 1000 AVAX staked to be removed\nPNG-YFI.e\nPNG-SUSHI.e\nPNG-UNI.e\n\nMost of these pools have under 200 AVAX staked, which is less than $10,000 USD. Also added 3 pools from non-native tokens that have less than 1000 AVAX staked (~$50,000 USD). Tokens that have had their PNG pool removed will instead have the AVAX pair increased from 1x to 2x multiplier\n\nFor more discussion on removing low value PNG pools, please see this governance post:\nhttps://gov.pangolin.exchange/t/remove-low-value-png-pools/1739\n\n\n\n", "choices": ["Yes, make these changes", "No, do not make these changes"], "start": 1630284000, "end": 1630456800, "snapshot": "3593196", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3B7631F8E3428dEaB77634BF799b622ce412e9Ea", "space": {"id": "pangolindex.eth", "name": "Pangolin"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
