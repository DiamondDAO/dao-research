It will give devs the opportunity to easily get funding to develop quality projects on Avalanche.\nComunity will decide which apps to list and participate in the IFO with PNG or PNG LP tokens.\nThis will increase demand and interest for PNG and attract more devs to develop more actively on the Avalanche blockchain.\nI believe this will be beneficial for both Pangolin and the Avalanch ecosystem in general.
