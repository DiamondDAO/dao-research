Hence in each pool, the reward factor of each LP should be increased by for each day spent in the liquidity pool.\n\nBelow is a numeric example for further clarity:\n\nLets assume that PNG-ETH Pool distributes 100PNG per day.\n\nThere are 3 LP\u2019s in this pool who have provided 1000 PNG over last 100 days.\n\nEach day spent in the pool is valued with an additional 0.02% reward factor.\n\nIn this scenario, the reward per LP is follows (See https://gov.pangolin.exchange/t/proposal-for-amending-the-yield-farming-mechanics/838 for the table format)\n\nPNG liquidity provided Duration in LP pools Reward factor Total Reward Factor Reward weight PNG Reward\nA B C = (1+0.2% x B) D = A x C E = D / Total D E x PNG reward bucket\nLP1 200 100 days 1+0.2%100=1.200 240 22.92% 22.9226361\nLP2 300 10 days 1+0.2%10=1.020 306 29.23% 29.22636103\nLP3 500 1 day 1+0.2%*1=1.002 501 47.85% 47.85100287\nTOTAL 1000 1047 100.00% 100\n\nEverytime an LP adds liquidity a new row will be added in the table as it would have a different time stamp. When withdrawing the liquidity, the last injected amount should go out first, or in other words first in last out (FILO)\n\nIt is also important to have a cap on the reward factor to balance the effect. I propose to cap it at 1.5 which can be reached in 25 days.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1617613200, "end": 1618822800, "snapshot": "970784", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa6b6c7F2596BA2a2F51Cf2B415001F0a94646F31", "space": {"id": "pangolindex.eth", "name": "Pangolin"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
