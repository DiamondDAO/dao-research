However, previously it was being voted a 10x. So lets decide here how much we ALL want. I just thought that starting with 10x was something fair for PNG holders who have supported the project since the beginning, whereas a lower number like 3x protects big investors who actually don't support PNG value at all. They earn money at the expense of early supporters. So lets make a big change for once and for all and make PNG rise again.
