I propose that the liquidity pool factors should be adjusted taking the IL within the calculation period into account such that the more IL in that specific pool, the more rewards it should get. This will work as a QUASI INSURANCE AGAINST IL for the LPs.\n\nAlso, the pairs with more tx volume require a bigger liquidity pool. I propose to take the transaction volume also into account when determining the rewards for each liquidity pool.\n\nThe IL adjusted liquidity weight should be 60% and the tx volume weight should be 40%.\n\nBelow is a numeric example (see https://gov.pangolin.exchange/t/proposal-for-amending-the-yield-farming-mechanics/838 for the table view)\n\nLiquidity (PLG) @ begining IL during calculatio period IL adjusted liquidity weight reward factor (60%) tx volume (mUSD) -40% Overall bucket weight Daily PNG reward\nA B C = A* (1+B) D E = 0.6 x C/\u2211C + 0.4 x D/ \u2211D\nPNG ETH 1000 20% 1,200.00 2.00 16% 15,844\nPNG BTC 2000 10% 2,200.00 3.00 27% 26,623\nPNG AVAX 5000 0% 5,000.00 6.00 58% 57,532\nTOTAL 8000 8,400.00 11.00 100% 100,000\n\nSpecific note on AVAX PNG Pools: I suggest it gets rewards from both PNG and AVAX buckets.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1617613200, "end": 1618822800, "snapshot": "970734", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa6b6c7F2596BA2a2F51Cf2B415001F0a94646F31", "space": {"id": "pangolindex.eth", "name": "Pangolin"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
