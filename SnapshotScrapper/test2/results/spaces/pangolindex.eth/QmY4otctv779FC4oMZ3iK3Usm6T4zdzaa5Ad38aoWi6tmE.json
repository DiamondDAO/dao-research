We'd like to offer them PNG rewards to help solidify our relationship. Constantly asking for community permission means that this will slow down our ability to engage with them in a timely manner.\n\nThis vote will be about whether the Pangolin Multisig will have an ability to offer PNG rewards (up to 100K USD) to projects we deem as long term partners. \n\nIf you'd like the Multisig to have autonomy on these decisions and trust us to choose partners to issue PNG rewards, then please choose yes.", "choices": ["Yes, allow Multig to allocate", "No, each should be voted on"], "start": 1630702800, "end": 1630875600, "snapshot": "3775381", "state": "closed", "author": "0xFd7b8597cF8eE5317439B0B5C55a111F6Eec449D", "space": {"id": "pangolindex.eth", "name": "Pangolin"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
