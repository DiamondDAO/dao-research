There are a number of ways that project developers instill confidence in their investors, these include the team doxxing themselves and independent third-party audits. While PorkSwap has been audited, it was by a little-known company called Solid Group, which appears to not even have its own website. I believe an audit from a well-established company such as Certik or Hacken would not only provide important insights into any potential flaws in the project but also boost confidence in the project and in itself be a strong advertising point. Given all the new functions and platforms the team has added over the past few months, an audit after the launch of the lottery and futures trading features is absolutely warranted. Additionally, providing public profiles of the development team is an easy way to garner confidence in the project and instantly shoot down any speculations that this project could be a rug pull.", "choices": ["Additional audit only", "Team dox only", "Audit and team dox", "None of the above are necessary"], "start": 1626876000, "end": 1628139540, "snapshot": "9352797", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB20eA3209236C3b8B8e5098a77f2D597FBa7B8e5", "space": {"id": "porkswap.eth", "name": "PorkSwap"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWYztDZ12tLpb9U3g7JA6MhQRXXWSUJATgydHtAYbHUDt", "voter": "0xB20eA3209236C3b8B8e5098a77f2D597FBa7B8e5", "created": 1626879227, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "porkswap.eth"}}]}
