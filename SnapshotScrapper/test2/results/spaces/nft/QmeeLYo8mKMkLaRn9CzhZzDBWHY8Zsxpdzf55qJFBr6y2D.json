Because $NFT token holders stand to benefit from the fee revenue accrued by the DEX, it is important that its fee structure is designed to maximize revenue generation in an increasingly competitive NFT space and that it be approved by the community of $NFT holders.\n\nThe NFT DEX at launch will have two sets of features:\n\n     1) ERC 721 <-> ERC 721 swaps\n     2) ERC 721 <-> ERC 20 swaps\n\nBecause there is not yet a mechanism for establishing a value basis for ERC 721 <-> ERC 721 swaps, we feel it is sensible for these transactions to incur a flat rate fee which, of course, could be restructured as ETH valuations fluctuate over time.\n\nERC 721 <-> ERC 20 swaps, on the other hand, have an obvious value basis and can thus incur a value-based fee. \n\n*It is worth noting that our market research indicates that the lowest fee charged for secondary market NFT sales by another platform is 2.5% charged to the seller and that most platforms charge 3% or more to both the buyer and the seller. We propose that the NFT DEX charge its fee to the buyer only so as to incentivize content creators to list their content on the DEX and that the seller be given the option to pay the fee for the buyer.\n\nFEE STRUCTURE PROPOSALS\n\nERC 721 <-> ERC 721 Flat Rate Fee:\n\n    A) .0005 ETH\n    B) .001 ETH\n    C) .005 ETH\n    D) .01 ETH\n    E) Mirror Gas Fee\n\nERC 721 <-> ERC 20 Value-Based Fee:\n\n    1) .3%\n    2) .5%\n    3) 1%\n    4) 1.5%\n    5) 2.5%\n\nWe feel that the fee structure proposed herein is most likely to make our NFT DEX a major contender within the NFT space. The specifics of that fee structure, however, are up to the community of $NFT holders. It is important that the specifics of the fees are low enough to be competitive in the NFT space and attract adequate volume to the DEX, yet high enough to generate substantial fee revenue for $NFT token holders.\n\nWe most certainly welcome alternative fee structure proposals from the community of $NFT holders if you feel we've overlooked something or that you have a better vision for the community to consider.\n", "choices": ["A & 1", "A & 2", "A & 3", "A & 4", "A & 5", "B & 1", "B & 2", "B & 3", "B & 4", "B & 5", "C & 1", "C & 2", "C & 3", "C &4", "C & 5", "D & 1", "D & 2", "D & 3", "D & 4", "D & 5", "E & 1", "E & 2", "E & 3", "E & 4", "E & 5"], "start": 1612994400, "end": 1613944800, "snapshot": "11830710", "state": "closed", "author": "0x73d8838aB8d39A91dB65465fad0032A9BaBDd3DA", "space": {"id": "nft", "name": "NFT Protocol"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
