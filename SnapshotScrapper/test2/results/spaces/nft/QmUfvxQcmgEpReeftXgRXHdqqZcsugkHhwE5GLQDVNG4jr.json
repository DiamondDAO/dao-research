{"id": "QmUfvxQcmgEpReeftXgRXHdqqZcsugkHhwE5GLQDVNG4jr", "title": "The NFT Rewards Ladder", "body": "Overview: \n\nRemain staked and increase your APY.  Token holders earn higher APY the longer their tokens remain staked, and forfeit their APY rate if they un-stake.  Holders start back at the bottom of the APY ladder when they re-enter staking.\n\nProposal:\n\nEXAMPLE: 90-day staking contracts is broken into 3 sub-periods of 30 days. Each period has the following yields:\n\nDay 0 to 30 - 2%\nDay 31 to 60 - 3%\nDay 61 to 90 - 5%\nSo total for 1st 90 days is 10% (equivalent to 40% APR) (more if you roll in your yields)\n\nIf a holder stakes throughout the period and then rolls over their tokens into a further 90-day contract they will receive bonus on the next round. \n\nEXAMPLE/IDEA % across the board bump on the above, scaled to keep yields from decreasing much, when you roll over to the next 90 day contract.\n\nDay 91 to 120 - 2%+2% bonus = 4%\nDay 121 to 150 - 3%+1.5% bonus = 4.5%\nDay 151 to 180 - 5%+1% bonus = 6%\nSo total for 2nd 90 days is 14.5% (equivalent to 58% APR) (more if you roll in your yields)\n\nRationale:\n\nMany popular new projects today focus on low time preference rewards. They stack the APY rewards high in the beginning to attract attention and help facilitate their rug pulls followed by tapering off the rewards as time goes on.\n\nThis proposal is the reverse. \n\nTraditional staking, such as with Tezos, allows users to enter and exit and achieve a consistent rate of return spread evenly over time but the yields are lower than with NFT and there is little incentive to stake longer aside from the normal return. \n\nWith this proposal whenever a staker joins the governance or Liquidity pool the rewards they receive will increase as time goes on. This will encourage users to keep their tokens staked for longer periods while still allowing them the freedom to withdraw if they please. \n\nIf a staker does withdraw from the pool they may rejoin at any time, however, they will again begin at the bottom of the rewards ladder when they rejoin. This will reward long term stakers and also serve to keep the supply available in the early stages lower to keep sell pressure down as we gain momentum. \n\nIn these market conditions, where there are a lot of shiny new objects for people to jump their funds around to, we want a way to keep people interested in their NFT stake (for their own long term good) beyond the day they join the telegram group. The only person who can pull your rung is you!\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1601035200, "end": 1601640000, "snapshot": "10932756", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2FFBE7Cb6b8e3bA6B621242612685dAA687C03D5", "space": {"id": "nft", "name": "NFT Protocol"}, "votes": 19, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTLzCK1AxnvkY9o8aADsEbWByQYb7KJDpMSKKRosWGLaE", "voter": "0xa443bE5B53e1E7A5E69912E73c72b95D8FBb9400", "created": 1601603180, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmdeKQNBGfNYYU5qK4aTRqV9wCHUmomqyAdmDuwdngZAMx", "voter": "0x537037C5ae805b9D4CeCAB5Ee07F12a8e59A15B2", "created": 1601587303, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmZN2DguFCSR9q88yiyZnsoQrcCaNAdwrkKmrN72iN3mRp", "voter": "0x1Db7289f468359582d4a58F719204C32D889B666", "created": 1601559167, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmVLZcbvrbJUSxYQMfdnUsyjsCEfC2bjkZQrHR5BD8giy3", "voter": "0x8dAAdA22fb588C300E2d00A5FD572d746Dd06CBC", "created": 1601474418, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmYMtS8Nkpzp6JTtCxkScMXu7C1UREvaioyNRSaRhQGja5", "voter": "0x2C2Ded3aEF46ff483647b6104E63B9430e0b078f", "created": 1601374715, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmWkePt1koQReUvp2pCXCHLhvskFeYYqCyCGFXSA8wHVB3", "voter": "0xFA38b1BB2B3fEE57dcd10c3D206642931990461F", "created": 1601374310, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmQJ2YUo4W97Sn2tgyehs75Wsb8SkHiRjVXo1BYgenpUwz", "voter": "0x0C96cC9E323A7B67B18858eb7758a384d6D1449F", "created": 1601268463, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmZtfXPN8X45Dj66wJvJPB25389jdkoU6QTDa1W7brJBBh", "voter": "0xC8D46eb7881975F9aE15216FeEBa2ff58E55803c", "created": 1601238119, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmZaF2ridWYt8A1JZwVuSQ6AvmrJ3wpWcmh1VkbnGNJJgG", "voter": "0x2FF2c6B09dA200b3Af5dee6D1C2656210B203f1D", "created": 1601106806, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmQYUfGDfzsZbKVY87bNa9jx28rPe5jvBgB8TsWra6RYGd", "voter": "0xbbB8Fd2d8DFeC69bC14834Aac0c25C2A4a4A6f2A", "created": 1601092657, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmVGWBnVeYX2pkDEMXCdGcr9EybnQR5R9CLDhqnz3ZxGS3", "voter": "0x516E77F8e53717530038d0496EF216604e2e0324", "created": 1601083533, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmZw7aXE4takCuc8seSwFU9Sgkx4Wq7Zbjid1Sydc1BnFL", "voter": "0xCcF43Dcc4e52e0216E461955bd98B08DA53213eA", "created": 1601062484, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmQ9wwpnfvvZVT4YUWPusRwr8atv3XeY7rYvZnEU3WHtaF", "voter": "0x695c22082302180EFcE83117D7C2C950D7a438A7", "created": 1601060560, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmYHR1ooRvA7XULbdtUmxaNM1ADPiwTYmtZ74htTFA66Hq", "voter": "0x877402fB9e6cdfEd8F74064B50F76d34E13F331F", "created": 1601059458, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmenHioodqQtftf9Dy2jZEJdJYRyJAGXDjTDPxNMDZHiXS", "voter": "0xB5905DbE33bb3193ED25dBE86C9436981E7cF54c", "created": 1601057573, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmcpxtjkMBoVKdHtGofC1mAp6sSVweokLQMbme6nyzqdLx", "voter": "0xaD04BB91a9648B1C799a5C9fd8e041D1acF77617", "created": 1601056208, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmUVGLdjp5C5JecZhKp88HCRWpNQbFNe96eDoFwi8S1yhi", "voter": "0x9169cD09Fc97f78f760A330c25Eb223823331944", "created": 1601055912, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "Qmczjt5R4Wp3GpANMa38qR2VHWSmBXQ5CWAcMEfj6hPVue", "voter": "0x56D31fd0C01089B468431A901BDE9d4aAe81b925", "created": 1601055842, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmbxLUHzbgSvRBj1Vb4xYJdafNaxjq2Q352FqFoS5vfyxd", "voter": "0x12e49d93588e0056bd25530C3B1E8AAc68F4B70a", "created": 1601050905, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}]}
