{"id": "QmYBhQQbHdEi4FKMjZZXzdQPkRP3HmAWgQoYECA87LhrPY", "title": " Treasury Proposal: CoinList Distribution", "body": "Summary:\nProposal to enable up to 30M $NFT to be distributed through CoinList for a serious marketing push and to get wide exposure among other crypto communities.\n\nProceeds from the distribution through CoinList will be directed to the Community Treasury, following payment of CoinList\u2019s fees.\n\nBackground:\nCoinList (coinlist.co) provides a platform for digital asset companies to distribute their tokens to non-US parties who are interested in becoming a part of new token protocols and ecosystems. CoinList prides themselves on compliant distributions, focusing on crypto-savvy audiences outside of the US, and carefully vetting all parties through Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance processes.\n\nSome of the biggest and most well known names in crypto space have raised funds or distributed tokens via Coinlist: NuCypher ($2.2b FDV), Filecoin ($151b FDV), Dfinity, Solana ($7b FDV) and ofcourse the one you should definitely know - FLOW, the NFT giant ($1b mcap / $42.5b FDV).\n\nFirst case of an already traded token (like in our case) being distributed through Coinlist is ongoing at this very moment - Rally.\n\nRally ($RLY) token price increased ~3x after the Coinlist news got released to the public.

And a gradual distribution schedule.\nCapped maximum purchase amount.\nA \"Yes\" or \"No\" vote would signal the team about the communities sentiment regarding this proposal.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1616102100, "end": 1616191200, "snapshot": "12065054", "state": "closed", "author": "0x544C0D4fe12355B673D33ca4146d74C2a4118142", "space": {"id": "nft", "name": "NFT Protocol"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmcvY1E4epVF1oKUXfQpXmr7dAmN5YwNhw29aRwNU1Hyfz", "voter": "0x8729e0f81Bfa27d0fa250Bc05517E161090AB051", "created": 1616158626, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmXBBbAzu5rVuuhWGcvsxxUpfMjDxELvapDUSUb92TJmLt", "voter": "0xB7E8cEA5f825B7629E7Bab43DAdD553942DE7BFf", "created": 1616150017, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmNxjrL6vqWdzmECf8FjYzFA89hmdKh2D9YwJzbJMKYWUB", "voter": "0xF9D4ca5fCbD02a031bb9f4c032a643C726B65f46", "created": 1616145714, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmfGGEE92Wr3hbxKsVkAdjL5AY7NcJ8XLEAYVSxPMbxEgB", "voter": "0x56A42908990Ca7185E3655978BbE681F43954933", "created": 1616143263, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmS93MVRGLY8nbn9NV6UGT7pVmJEntqBnnGjvjY1ZHFAxH", "voter": "0x9d414fDB34A0e30792a740C9B4386193179B93b3", "created": 1616140535, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmP3mutB2i8yAv74M6EjbT5QiZ8NREgtazdRngH7xWGssF", "voter": "0x808E50c4a28EF51778eE1feef231d9afF90458B2", "created": 1616137554, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmZESdF5rtg9xvGZ9ios4NVQWqFN13yXqbNscKaxGehUvV", "voter": "0x9d2BeEa6625c1991C796c498B93842d9E09cb6d6", "created": 1616137402, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmdTvEJs887pNmQ9qv1uUbAvHPYTCccSrSmVqoCHcAhfG8", "voter": "0x4cb038FAd7C390eae706ec065e96a2e4cc00Ed4B", "created": 1616137163, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmfVsqPaaPUYeZESHTfKrQ6K3DRhQhtd1QCvo2qkTF5Yea", "voter": "0x2fecD0d5D08793Ba4891007A1480a4df566aA31A", "created": 1616128671, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmaLgXFiikTRLcuzKPLb5xcBBCmhp5e2RaeoP2FBUHS1fC", "voter": "0x14Ce500a86F1e3aCE039571e657783E069643617", "created": 1616110889, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}, {"id": "QmRcV7bvnf1S5ridwuHEy7ujVoH9Mxudo2hw3o5mdGjGwg", "voter": "0x544C0D4fe12355B673D33ca4146d74C2a4118142", "created": 1616102174, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft"}}]}
