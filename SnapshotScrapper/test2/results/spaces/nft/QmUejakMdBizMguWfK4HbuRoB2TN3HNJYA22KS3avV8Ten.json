At the same, reward existing token holders with collectibles.  It\u2019s a two way street that gets our community owning collectibles, while encouraging creators and platforms to join our mission.\n\nHow it could work:\n\nOption A - Top 50 Holder Drops\n\n> Platforms or creators could issue drops to the top 50 holders. In return a platform or creator earns say 5,000 $NFT\n> Pros: This encourages everyone to try and become the next $NFT whale\n> Cons: It may alienate holders without the ability to become an $NFT whale\n\nOption B - Staker Drops\n\n> Platforms or creators could issue drops to all holders who have locked a minimum of 10,000 tokens in an NFT Protocol 90-Day Staking Wallet, and the holders are only delivered the collectibles if they hold for the full 90-days.  In return a platform or creator earns say 5,000 $NFT\n> Pros: This encourages holders to stake their tokens for 90 days at a time\n> Cons: none, it\u2019s amazing. May need configuration in the staking contract\n\n\nRisk Mitigation:\n\nThe risk is that, like Rarible, creators start abusing the system and issue trashy collectibles just to earn the token rewards.  This could be mitigated by:\n1. only allowing a platform or creator to do one drop per month, to avoid abuse as well as make high quality exclusive content for us\n2. requiring that the drop be approved by 24-hour community vote", "choices": ["Option A + B", "Option A only", "Option B only", "None of the above"], "start": 1600898400, "end": 1601244000, "snapshot": "10000001", "state": "closed", "author": "0x663483162fCf796e3Bec9D2331d899d6515af1a2", "space": {"id": "nft", "name": "NFT Protocol"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
