Finance by holding 4-year-locked iceCREAM, participating in its governance and providing significant ETH and GNO liquidity to the protocol.\n\nGNO listing on C.R.E.A.M. was a crucial first step to enabling collateralised lending for GNO holders. Increasing GNO's collateral factor would give additional utility for GNO token holders and incentivise activity in C.R.E.A.M. Finance.\n\nAsset Details:\nGNO is the token that represents the governance of the GnosisDAO.\nGNO is a very liquid token that currently allows trades of 400K USDT with a price impact lower than 2% as shown on https://cowswap.exchange\n\nAt the time of writing $2.7MM worth of GNO is already deposited to C.R.E.A.M. \nGNO token holders are demonstrating continued interest using GNO in DeFi with +$45MM liquidity provided to Balancer and Uniswap pools and +8MM in Unit Protocol.\n\nhttps://blog.gnosis.pm/announcing-gnosisdao-a7102fcf9224\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gnosis\n\nBackground\nWebsite: https://gnosis.io/\nForum: https://forum.gnosis.io/\nhttps://blog.gnosis.pm/\n\nForum discussion about increasing GNO collateral factor:\nhttps://forum.cream.finance/t/increase-gno-collateral-factor/1765\n\nAction item\nFor: Collateral factor of GNO is increased to C5 level.\nAgainst: Do nothing.", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST"], "start": 1631782800, "end": 1632128400, "snapshot": "13223127", "state": "closed", "author": "0xe965484BA4250c446779D4703f1598DC2EA00d12", "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth", "name": "Cream Finance"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRHwYSR7sWfeWP17CUUX6m9ecQyoc1njP3cKuJrvehBWb", "voter": "0x04b135cf5d88eCCEb208fc39FBA35E1881db9dDa", "created": 1632120418, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmThQb9cyQe2YktwoXcTzGjVrHzpbxbYDA3PvU4ctKhrDS", "voter": "0xe965484BA4250c446779D4703f1598DC2EA00d12", "created": 1631790387, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}]}
