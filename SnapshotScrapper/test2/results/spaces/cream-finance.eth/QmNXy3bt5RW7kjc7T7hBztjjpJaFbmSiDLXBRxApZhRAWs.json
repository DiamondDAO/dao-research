Lending.\n\n**For**: List HUSD as collateral asset\n**Against**: Do nothing\n\n## Background\n\nCategory: U.S. dollar backed stablecoin\nIssuer: Stable Universal limited\nCustodian: Paxos Trust\nBacked by: U.S. Dollar, 1:1 ratio\nAudit: Withum, monthly\nYear of Issuance: July, 2019\nSmart Contract is [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdf574c24545e5ffecb9a659c229253d4111d87e1)\n\nHUSD is an ERC-20 token that is 1:1 ratio pegged with USD. It was issued by Stable Universal.\n\nTo ensure the 1:1 backing is maintained, monthly audits of HUSD are conducted by an independent US audit firm. The reports can be checked [here](https://www.stcoins.com/attestation/index)\n\nSource: [HUSD official website](http://www.stcoins.com/)\n\n**How to get HUSD Liquidity**\n\n* Official website of HUSD: 1:1 exchange between USD and HUSD , fiat on/off ramp\n* Centralized Exchanges: Huobi, FTX, HBTC, Hotbit, Hoo\n* Decentralized Exchanges: Curve, Uniswap, Mooniswap , 0x, kyber network, tokenlon\n* DeFi Platforms: Fortube, YFII, 1inch, FYII (DFI.MONEY), BiDAO, HubDAO, MakerDao (green lighted)\n* OTCs: Amber Group, Huobi OTC, Legend Trading, FTX OTC, Paxos\n\n**HUSD Marketcap Ranking**\n\nAround $270M marketcap\n![image|690x471](upload://bR39WmPlldsNczAVqrhiUvW9k0o.png) \nsource: https://cryptoslate.com/cryptos/stablecoin/\n\n![image|690x401](upload://z7Y8NSsvpA9SEXb2tSEiziSfk31.png) \nsource: https://debank.com/ranking/stablecoin\n\n## Benefits for [C.R.E.A.M.]  Community\n\n**More Diversify For the System**\n\nFor Centralized stablecoins C.R.E.A.M. has supported, you can clear see the differences.\nBy adding a new stablecoin asset with monthly auditing, regulated trust holding and different issuer, can lower down the sysmetic risk. Even one of the issuer gets any problem (regulation, compliance, business operation.....), people can still use other stablecoin asset on C.R.E.A.M.\n\n![image|414x138](upload://kJiBY0rYqN5IltF6lIyogiU8obj.png)\n\n**Attract New Users For C.R.E.A.M.**\n\nAs HUSD has users in both centralized world and defi community, which is quite different from what USDT/USDC has,  it will brings C.R.E.A.M. more opportunities to landing new market.\n\n## Risk & Weakness\n\n*The market cap and liquidity of HUSD is relatively lower than USDT, USDC and the liquidity is not good as USDT, USDC. so the Collateral Factor of HUSD should be set lower.\n\n-----contents above are drafted by DeFiNavy-----\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-list-husd-as-collateral-asset", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1605006000, "end": 1605092400, "snapshot": "11229133", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb6e362900B7113F246A7e1c17E9746b3B9C079dB", "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth", "name": "Cream Finance"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmT9o4vBmRXMnnswiFYzn79M2eoLebFUq7A8tSyUGmXKyN", "voter": "0xe2D27f6242E848d310B000Cc355a4C1E470FE779", "created": 1605074558, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQvqUsGiVdnsFaKheShvXqyDpVTeAbg2Eq6qYApNxm7J7", "voter": "0x81B31e31f8a90d3DB90eBBc221569F030f4E1f25", "created": 1605056989, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNkvtyUbHP9LJj2cS6hXdVHEWSH3zbZFgpXqbsRb8Z3Jn", "voter": "0x864E5587C42247E18cAE03226767D0AB90888768", "created": 1605020696, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmcrnwxh3C1bqWrJc4NEVEznqbhoftUDusKToRZNtUHZZR", "voter": "0x36cc7B13029B5DEe4034745FB4F24034f3F2ffc6", "created": 1605017439, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}]}
