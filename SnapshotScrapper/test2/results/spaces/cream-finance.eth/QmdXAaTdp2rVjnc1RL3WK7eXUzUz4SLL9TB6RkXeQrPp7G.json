Start a new topic [in Proposal in Forum](https://forum.cream.finance/c/proposal). It can be a solid plan or just an idea.\n2. Discuss with the community in Forum for at least 24 hours before voting\n3. Write a proposal to conclude the whole idea\n    * Proposal MUST have a proper title to reveal the core idea\n    * Proposal MUST begin with Summary section (in short, please)\n    * Proposal MUST have Action Item section for explaining each voting option explicitly\n    * Proposal SHOULD use \"For\" / \"Against\" as options in binary decision\n    * Proposal SHOULD provide \"No Change Required\" as option in multiple choice \n    * Proposal CAN have Background, Motivation, Specification or any other aspect to support the idea, or use [EIP template](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-template.md)\n4. Submit the proposal along with topic link [in Snapshot](https://vote.cream.finance) by holding 1,500 CREAM at least, which is also the minimum requirement for a proposal to list in Snapshot, and the voting period must be longer than 24 hours\n5. Comment in the topic with the voting link\n\nWarning\n\n1. If a proposal does not follow these steps, it is invalid\n2. If a proposal does not get more than 15,000 CREAM votes in total, it is invalid\n3. All rules can be modified by a valid proposal, but \"fully discussed with the community\" should be the principle\n4. All rules apply to the community and the team\n\n# Option\n\nFor / Against", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1603699200, "end": 1603785600, "snapshot": "11130553", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb6e362900B7113F246A7e1c17E9746b3B9C079dB", "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth", "name": "Cream Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
