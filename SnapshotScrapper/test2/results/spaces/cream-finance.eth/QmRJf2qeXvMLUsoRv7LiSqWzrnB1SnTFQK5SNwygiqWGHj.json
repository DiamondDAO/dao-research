And its growing use cases prove that the value has been recognized by the market. \n\n**Use Cases (examples):** \n1.\tJuan Benet, the founder of Filecoin, praised HFIL on Twitter, thinking that using HFIL and DeFi, anyone can migrate FIL to Ethereum and use smart contracts to handle various things. Miners can rely on DeFi infrastructure and loan market. \n[Juan Benet's Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/juanbenet/status/1318217566473445376) \n\n**How to Get H-Tokens (HFIL)?**\nTo meet users' fast exchange of H-Tokens, Huobi Global will take the lead in supporting H-series. Users can choose HFIL (or other H-token like HBTC when withdrawing their BTC (or other original asset like FIL)\na)\tBuy, deposit or get BTC through trading and save it in the Exchange account on Huobi Global\nb)\tSelect BTC (or other original asset e.g. FIL) - Withdraw - HBTC (or other H-Tokens e.g. HFIL) in the Exchange account\nc)\tEnter the address and amount for withdrawal and click \"Withdraw\"\nPlease read this article for A Step by Step Guide: [HBTC Withdrawal Guide](https://support.hbfile.net/hc/en-us/search/click?data=BAh7CjoHaWRsKwi3hV2M0QA6CXR5cGVJIgxhcnRpY2xlBjoGRVQ6CHVybEkiWWh0dHBzOi8vaHVvYmlnbG9iYWwuemVuZGVzay5jb20vaGMvZW4tdXMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvOTAwMDAzMTA0MTgzLUhCVEMtV2l0aGRyYXdhbC1HdWlkZQY7B1Q6DnNlYXJjaF9pZEkiKWI4ZWUzMzM0LWI3ODAtNDcyZC1iMDJiLTZkMmYxYzQ4ZWZhMwY7B0Y6CXJhbmtpBg%3D%3D--6a3c6d2f8cffe8b4419ece82d7500e93665a977b)\n\n**Our Strengths:**\nA World Class Security System\n *   Secure and reliable class services\n *   Six years of experience in digital asset services\n *   Decentralized structure and anti-DDOS protection system\n\nLocal Operation Teams Across the Globe\n *  Global Ecological Layout\n *  Local trading service centers in many countries around the world\n *  Blockchain ecosystem featuring integration of multiple business forms\n\nRemodeling the Crypto Exchange\n *  Users first\n *  Develop compensation first system\n *  Develop User Protection Fund\n\n**Benefits for C.R.E.A.M:**\nHuobi Group has maintained more than 15 million users in the world, and H-Tokens like HFIL play the key roles to bridge the BTC and FILECOIN users to Ethereum ecology in participating the DeFi activities. And as witnessed, market needs of HFIL jump sharply. Thus, having HFIL listed on C.R.E.A.M would surely introduce quite a decent amount of liquidity to C.R.E.A.M and to benefit the growth of C.R.E.A.M.
