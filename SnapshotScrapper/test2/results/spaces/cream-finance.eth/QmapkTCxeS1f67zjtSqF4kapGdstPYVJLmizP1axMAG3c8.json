DPI should be considered the safest asset on CREAM outside of stables and ETH. I propose we copy the [collateral factors of DPI's underlying tokens](https://docs.cream.finance/lending/collateral-factor-and-reserve-factor-1) as the initial collateral rate for DPI setting it at 45% LTV.\n\nConsidering it's more stable due to diversification and tokens are held 1:1 in reserve by a smart contract it should actually be substantially higher. Initially setting it equal to its components is a good precaution until DPI has a longer track record.\n\nHere is some data analysis on relative stability of DPI vs its underlying tokens and volatility compare to ETH:\n\n- https://medium.com/coinmonks/diversification-is-the-only-free-lunch-in-finance-dd225a5aba38\n- https://twitter.com/AnalyserOver/status/1322886283128090624\n- https://twitter.com/krugman25/status/1323422700157706243\n\n-----contents above are drafted by Kiba-----\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-increase-collateral-factor-for-dpi-to-50", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1605006000, "end": 1605092400, "snapshot": "11229221", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb6e362900B7113F246A7e1c17E9746b3B9C079dB", "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth", "name": "Cream Finance"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXZJbHADja68MEsYz2pkGD9TPDamxMoXu9eXKGSnkK7c4", "voter": "0xe2D27f6242E848d310B000Cc355a4C1E470FE779", "created": 1605074588, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXvGfnJGUvFkwQJJ6gj2uNz28o2EJUUTQ1By7GskxFeMk", "voter": "0x30dB01087fEBd7b67DC486812b322b4867Cb8cA7", "created": 1605056926, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmePNo6yz5BjZjfVyhM28QibKuHNPJ8GMhHJBH5S3gSc1E", "voter": "0x864E5587C42247E18cAE03226767D0AB90888768", "created": 1605020645, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUPsNRHsTst9WETmHsGXoGq9Qwb7Vk3jRc7SMo1Lq2D3Q", "voter": "0x36cc7B13029B5DEe4034745FB4F24034f3F2ffc6", "created": 1605017364, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}]}
