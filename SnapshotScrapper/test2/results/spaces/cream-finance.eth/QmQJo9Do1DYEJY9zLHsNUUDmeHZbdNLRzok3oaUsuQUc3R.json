Binance will lock a portion of tokens on their own native chains and mint the same number of tokens as ERC20 tokens on Ethereum with a naming convention of BBTC. Deposits and withdrawals for BBTC are enabled on binance.com by 31.Oct.2020. Check the [official announcement](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/b4b0312230964cf1a347d4712be5123d)\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Current Liquidity and the strategy of BBTC. Why should we have it?**\n\n[BBTC contract address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9be89d2a4cd102d8fecc6bf9da793be995c22541)\n\nBBTC was just launched last week, which is a very important strategy of Binance and Binance community to support cross-chain assets and liquidities, and we are approaching/ adding liquidity to the top DeFi protocols of Ethereum; \n\nHere\u2019s the list we are going to add BBTC in the coming weeks: Uniswap, Aave, Curve, Compound, Cream, Fortube(Listed), MakerDao, Balancer, InstaDapp, and more. \n\n**Benefits for [Cream] and the general DeFi Community**\n\n**Larger User Bases and Liquidity Growth:**\nBinance is one of the largest crypto exchanges, and >15m Binance communities can potentially contribute to the DeFi ecosystem. BBTC will become an important bridge between CeFi and DeFi worlds, which will introduce quite decent liquidity in the DeFi ecosystem on Ethererum.\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n1. BBTC is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network that represents a 1:1 peg of the same asset on their own blockchain.\n2. Heightened security and risk control measures for the wrapped tokens are in place, as well as using the SAFU fund to ensure the safety of users\u2019 assets.\n\nBBTC might become an incentive token in the future. The holder will share the savings revenue of the BBTC they hold. (features are in design).\n\n**How to Exchange BBTC on Binance?**\nBinance.com users can deposit or withdraw BTokens by selecting the ERC20 network option in the Binance.com wallet when trying to deposit or withdraw. For example, BBTC is the BToken token representing BTC wrapped on Ethereum:\n\n1. To withdraw BBTC, users need to select the ERC20 network and input an ERC20 address on the BTC withdrawal page.\n2. To deposit BBTC users need to select the ERC20 network when depositing BTC and acquire the ERC20 deposit address for BTC.\n\nFurthermore, In the mid of Nov, Binance Bridge can support to transfer in/out of the BTC from the bitcoin network to Ethereum or vice versa, which will need a Binance.com account. \n\n\n**References**\nClick to find the official announcement from Binance: \n[Binance Token Canal Enables Wrapped BTokens on Ethereum](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/b4b0312230964cf1a347d4712be5123d)\n\nClick to find the official blog from Binance:\n[Token Canal Upgrade: Binance Wrapped BTokens on Ethereum, Panama Turns into Bridge](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684901158/Token-Canal-Upgrade-Binance-Wrapped-BTokens-on-Ethereum-Panama-Turns-into-Bridge)\n\nBBTC on the Coinmarket Cap/Coingecko:  In progress.\n\n[click to check Custodian and the Audit Report](https://github.com/binance-chain/token-canal-project)\n\nThanks, Regards.", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1604556000, "end": 1604642400, "snapshot": "11195253", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb6e362900B7113F246A7e1c17E9746b3B9C079dB", "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth", "name": "Cream Finance"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPX7FV9iESAPKCqX9Me83BTELaUp2d3rpBkbhGi8oumxu", "voter": "0xF5ecA360c5dE26A46D54b72E49800c87801c719b", "created": 1604639135, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY1Cf6PaK4WPWaZby49iHYtdy4xeKSzFLUWcNLsWaJLSQ", "voter": "0x30dB01087fEBd7b67DC486812b322b4867Cb8cA7", "created": 1604572157, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme2gLaUx5nncogcaYSQq8xuZotWBqiYyd97tQYieQXC9W", "voter": "0xe2D27f6242E848d310B000Cc355a4C1E470FE779", "created": 1604572062, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXWPNHWoQMNQNFZpq1yjjpX8iZeosawpYaT8kYY91nusG", "voter": "0x81B31e31f8a90d3DB90eBBc221569F030f4E1f25", "created": 1604564096, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY2Y7jgDMk5h4m6epYyBGfoMXqaz7c5UPELMbfoS2TfRW", "voter": "0x36cc7B13029B5DEe4034745FB4F24034f3F2ffc6", "created": 1604562901, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}]}
