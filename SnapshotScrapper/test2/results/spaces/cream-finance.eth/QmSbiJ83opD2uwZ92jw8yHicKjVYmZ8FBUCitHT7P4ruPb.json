Prevent CREAM from being borrowed.\n\n**For**: Borrow Pause for CREAM\n**Against**: Do nothing\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs the token of the protocol, CREAM is not only essential to the community member, but also plays an important role as our governance token. For the sake of stability of CREAM, we should prevent CREAM from being borrowed.\n\nThis is an arguable implementation. However, it's also practiced among lending protocols.\n\nAave also prevents AAVE from being borrowed. Despite the reason might be different, but it's the same concept to stabilize and prevent the token from being manipulated. As protocol team, we consider this is a good implementation to the community and the whole protocol. Thus, we would like to implement via Borrow Pause.\n\nAfter CREAM borrow is paused, existing borrowers are not affected.\n\n==========\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/borrow-pause-for-cream/562", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1610863200, "end": 1611122400, "snapshot": "11670913", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb6e362900B7113F246A7e1c17E9746b3B9C079dB", "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth", "name": "Cream Finance"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVjhMgy6g3ZJ1Hzt5k3YZGzdQnPrs4RNFg1bBupMFn9QR", "voter": "0xb0f4b88d29667607E88198a12E6B19700b08AbF1", "created": 1611079827, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYNzDaa12PakWCv6KveJK1ne1tCLG5waezZS4dHVz3cRC", "voter": "0xCc39aD64058d0f1E7e930a8F63F5646f01884184", "created": 1611053672, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUPxzWQoMscY6aHpKMmqQPtQXJrnUuJkppvNfEuujL4SF", "voter": "0xC8e66291fC15B6392d56ac2EF3dB3Ce4fd8c070A", "created": 1611041431, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUjCgnx6fFQafcd5snmcNz22RXr965SW9VL5Sm6zksqcR", "voter": "0x81B31e31f8a90d3DB90eBBc221569F030f4E1f25", "created": 1610976740, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcYYJKKSj6ijqkSRfeMBJUP1zie6t62AdnKNQResSusKN", "voter": "0xEb9105815280F533be51Bf076fA008F165d03262", "created": 1610975578, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP2hPUNA3j6Q8Y2vWGsqdTcA6QZp6jQfG54PZ1i1mHUDc", "voter": "0x1efEd205cAeDe27dA1135cd37A4192861a51100e", "created": 1610975304, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWJHoZmwGTLq8YBydhnppjWihfV6BztC5CnAdrHQyn3L6", "voter": "0x70bef05BbAF710bc6A3a278b00109f4a1b8DeA48", "created": 1610947022, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfXhtW9Pj5gYG7zBrv3SzFHLwbNXhbcrq4s5eKsPKwLqf", "voter": "0x76Da9F88e63a85Ba8BFA19F3821D5A271753D3dc", "created": 1610922180, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}]}
