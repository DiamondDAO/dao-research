TBTC release candidate 1 went live in September 2020 and currently has $32M in TBTC locked.\n\n**For**: List TBTC as collateral asset\n**Against**: Do nothing\n\n## Benefits for CREAM\n\n**New user base**: Each Bitcoin on Ethereum project brings with it a community who resonate with the projects values. This proposal will allow the CREAM TVL to expand, and the TBTC community to borrow other Assets against their TBTC.\n\n**Additional strategies**: As CREAM starts to collaborate with the Yearn Ecosystem  there might be additional opportunities to use TBTC through CREAM.\n\n**Diversity of choice for BTC based Collateral**:\nCurrently CREAM supports:\n- HBTC (Huobi BTC) \n- BBTC (Binance Wrapped BTC) \n- RenBTC \n\nTBTC offers an alternative that has been fully decentralised from launch.\n\n## Benefits for the general DeFi Community\n\nBring Optionality to the DeFi Community with a decentralized Bitcoin Exposure.\n\nDecentralized Assets are essential for DeFi to stay \u201cDecentralized\u201d. It is important to keep that prospective in mind as a lot of liquidity based on Centralized Assets has flown into the DeFi Ecosystem.\n\n## Details about TBTC\n\nThe tBTC system is developed by the Keep Network.\n\ntBTC is\n\n* Decentralized\n* Trustless\n* Permissionless\n* Fully collateralized\n* Open Source\n* Audited\n\nEach bitcoin deposit is stored in a separate wallet created by the signers. The protocol has strong economic security measures. Depositors don\u2019t have to trust custodians, aka signers, because signers deposit an ETH bond higher than the value of the BTC they hold in custody.\n\nIn the event that signers colluded to steal BTC the network would seize their ETH bond (150% of the BTC they have signed for) and slash their KEEP stake by the minimum stake amount (currently 70,000 KEEP).\n\nThe permissionless nature can be summed up by:\n\nQuestion - \u201cHow many doors would you have to kick down to stop my TBTC being redeemed for BTC?\u201d\nAnswer - \u201cGood luck finding the doors\u201d\n\n## Current Liquidity and Availability\n\n**TBTC Statistics:**\n\nThis site shows current Supply of TBTC, total Value Locked, Mints and Redeems, as well as Bonded Value (securing the TBTC) (https://keepstats.org/)\n\nPools available in Curve, Uniswap, and Balancer\n\nCurrently there are Rewards Incentives for holding TBTC Curve Pool: the LP token can then be deposited in Harvest and BadgerDAO.\n\n=====Contents above are drafted by ramaruro=====\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-add-tbtc-as-collateral-asset/264", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1607920200, "end": 1608179400, "snapshot": "11448819", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb6e362900B7113F246A7e1c17E9746b3B9C079dB", "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth", "name": "Cream Finance"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWFp27z3g9G4txccGfPpsEHtPSKDMVMAPa7fJgPka11qp", "voter": "0x76Da9F88e63a85Ba8BFA19F3821D5A271753D3dc", "created": 1608172046, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTPTfcoxnAY6pECHqLrzXaTmjK7Dzv3RuEBjpDrTbf6d6", "voter": "0x6C8E4D6f376336871821Dbe369BFE444fDd1fc99", "created": 1608159495, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSrxsMhr54P3QwY8HkaTHieG3xC64w6CuaSoMc7pXu7B2", "voter": "0x5F78b8363fec154970748D1D61319fBE89F59727", "created": 1608048831, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYAwLie9xN8wN29jvLuST6mq8hopUSTa6xsx93WPde47J", "voter": "0xD9b49a81ee72aF3C026a2C144C9Ffd678A78C8b1", "created": 1608038775, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdU38icLWyqdSbPmPo3iCuUtGpHrD6MPo5UxLsehFWrYp", "voter": "0x576B1C2d113C634d5849181442aEc5a3A9148c1e", "created": 1607988896, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP54ooiB82W44GHMGZHYBv4sgNAC2m2dMmpU43RfmSAoD", "voter": "0x08534Afa2BbB0b0a69324339d4dc03b45ad11078", "created": 1607983606, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeqogJVk6Jbr4S1cxxdbQ7hWMSvfKZkrzkFFik3fBsoXy", "voter": "0x3DDc27ee1dc4aF2f01201Fa1c8f834815b5fF2bC", "created": 1607983539, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbCrUjuqBuj3ff2JynBfWKgLJgf6gyk5FgDfgyaxc3BFh", "voter": "0x36cc7B13029B5DEe4034745FB4F24034f3F2ffc6", "created": 1607967283, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXCbY4bwaao6ryKuafH61YDt5xmXAwdk7CXeLZzGhn3xR", "voter": "0x2F680Fdf9a62B841A66c54E53117Ac611A7374d9", "created": 1607966386, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW2ebiSDV3JFK2YGkt5aFNx5he27Ksqd6U31dawkakDrN", "voter": "0x80Ad7547D879AB0481Eda439BF0514e02B0Cc2b9", "created": 1607955576, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTjskGPuUgPVa7bDXDPB5DPM24q2vbNfdboG3uiCfp9T9", "voter": "0xD72B03B7F2E0b8D92b868E73e12b1f888BEFBeDA", "created": 1607946464, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRkGxMz26FgF3Z8QhWNc7JPSN2Buu1VeZGhRnJm94Uriz", "voter": "0x7De27209440CAC3707AC0114337ffb2E0b87B4eE", "created": 1607945045, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}]}
