It is a fork of the Basis Cash protocol, which we believe to be the most robust design in the space. The project has been well received by the market, with over $1.4B in TVL in the first 24 hours after launch.\n\n**For**: List MIC as a collateral asset\n**Against**: Do nothing\n \n## Motivation\n\n**Abstract**\nThe Mithril Cash protocol controls money supply similarly to how central banks of the world may guide the value of fiat money through monetary policy. By controlling the quantity of money supply in an economy by minting fresh currency or selling bonds, a target value can be achieved (In this case $1). Instead of a central bank or a currency board, rules are set and executed programmatically via smart contracts so that behavior of the system can be predictable.\n\nEvery 24 hours, the TWAP of the MIC price from the MIC-USDT Sushiswap pool is used to determine if the MIC supply needs to be expanded or contracted. The stabilization threshold is currently set to 1.01 MIC/USDT.\n\nIf TWAP > 1.01, expansionary policy is applied and new MIC is minted using the formula circulatingSupply *(oraclePrice-1)\n\nIf TWAP < 1.01, contractionary policy is applied. Mithril Bonds are made available for purchase at an algorithmically set price. With a Mithril Cash oracle price of P USDT, bonds are sold off at a price of P MIC (effective price being P^2 USDT), promising bond holders a premium when redeemed. Purchased bonds can be converted to Mithril Cash at a 1:1 rate, insofar as the preconditions are met and the Treasury is not empty.\n\n**Benefits to CREAM**\n\u2022 As the first major DeFi protocol to integrate MIC, CREAM would be well positioned to capture additional TVL as our circulating supply grows\n\u2022 Potential for further synergies down the line. Leveraged strategies could be built atop the MITH protocol\n\n**Milestones**\n\u2022 Sushiswap trading volume on Day 1: $96M\n\u2022 Currently ranked 5 and 6 on Sushiswap\n\u2022 TVL: $1.4B within 24 hours of launch.\n\u2022 Decentralized: 3x the number of holders as comparables\n\u2022 Partnerships: QCP Capital\n\n**Resources**\nMain\n\u2022 Website: https://mith.cash/\n\u2022 Docs: https://sauron.gitbook.io/mith-cash/\n\u2022 Guide: https://mithcash.medium.com/overall-guide-of-mith-cash-for-beginners-en-zh-1325423d155a\n\u2022 Github: https://github.com/mithio\n\u2022 Dune Analytics: https://duneanalytics.com/0xBoxer/mith-cash\n\u2022 Yield Farming Tool: https://mith-cash-tool.web.app/mithcash/\n\nSocial / Community\n\u2022 Discord link: https://discord.gg/EacqCKujT7\n\u2022 Telegram: https://t.co/cy1BNDWwGJ?amp=1\n\u2022 Twitter: https://twitter.com/mithcash\n\u2022 Medium: https://mithcash.medium.com/\n\n==========\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/list-mic-as-collateral-asset/537", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1610708400, "end": 1610967600, "snapshot": "11659107", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb6e362900B7113F246A7e1c17E9746b3B9C079dB", "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth", "name": "Cream Finance"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmb1wXfUqp6TWCCus2KAVjVBfEyuvKuYMj5a3TivBv3eYa", "voter": "0xEb9105815280F533be51Bf076fA008F165d03262", "created": 1610941151, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX3nvYDNoeEt5hStusXoQ8soWqrkUpqxbv5u9UP6sEPtN", "voter": "0x68575571E75D2CfA4222e0F8E7053F056EB91d6C", "created": 1610923777, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR89cRgkqdZytL9bAPRbgkq2j9Uv6meLcc6eHtcEMh8ir", "voter": "0xDa179069E1800C1420A3C82cA92dD04C5a0D017c", "created": 1610852351, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNrkh52sFH845uKgQnoLNmyDXYWrn29Zae4pkxQd2F9jG", "voter": "0x76Da9F88e63a85Ba8BFA19F3821D5A271753D3dc", "created": 1610820967, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY97GSVE1Ft8fxpwzFZQyza6mDzRPYdyf5HngWkNESCrV", "voter": "0xb0f4b88d29667607E88198a12E6B19700b08AbF1", "created": 1610812980, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNfrEyiYD4DryKcr7GB1QxmEv1iteu4tJUgAM8AW3uWmf", "voter": "0x576B1C2d113C634d5849181442aEc5a3A9148c1e", "created": 1610713180, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}]}
