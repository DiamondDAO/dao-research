Finance will transit the existing Fantom markets from app.cream.finance to Yearn frontend, and it will become the Fantom Iron Bank at launch.\n\nThe right of the listing decision will also be transferred from Listing Committee to the Iron Bank team, which is consistent with the current practice of Ethereum Iron Bank.\n\n**For**\n> Approve the transition\n\n**Against**\n> Do nothing\n\n## Motivation\n\nIron Bank on Ethereum has reached $1B total supply, and the credit limit / whitelisted borrowing has been proven capital efficient with our partners Yearn and Alpha Homora. With Iron Bank launching on Fantom, we can extend the same practice to Fantom, and work with Yearn for the greater market.\n\n## Specification\n\nOnce the voting has passed, the team will begin the transition to Fantom Iron Bank.\n\nDuring the transition, user can access Fantom Iron Bank through both C.R.E.A.M. Finance and Yearn frontend. It will be a roughly four weeks transition period, with start date and end date to be announced. This allows user to get familiar with the new entrance to Fantom Iron Bank.", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1633071600, "end": 1633330800, "snapshot": "13331854", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb6e362900B7113F246A7e1c17E9746b3B9C079dB", "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth", "name": "Cream Finance"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVbmSGtqm92sWdz3J1YrsudWaerX8GGZJwSkSzLsjqUkW", "voter": "0xeC8Dd4b79133d5154149c3AD6c35Fb0b49B2D7Ab", "created": 1633324372, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTq6ygsnNyvL2yBhJjit8VwDtVvHPq8VbWfA1eqZrMphM", "voter": "0xCC876be657B5d3d80cB9D483fb846766a8b80185", "created": 1633319245, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYqemFABoVGwWDfNUF5KBveQn7pgDhqyRf1LwTjc8XbLM", "voter": "0x81f8CaBe89066d43EB4faFD8E4E5256C102E6E30", "created": 1633316230, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRWEMv65AsrUoqo9LC7LCLRs6f8q64YUeLtDHVvr6vMXm", "voter": "0x1efEd205cAeDe27dA1135cd37A4192861a51100e", "created": 1633315543, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmduEfqBqNLRRaY21tbZf9MKVsVCHrdyC1eavYK1k6TLtK", "voter": "0xEb9105815280F533be51Bf076fA008F165d03262", "created": 1633315443, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSgHzWjf2GBvG82q24gwQ9imyN5q8jjgt8nHKpUGRo5MJ", "voter": "0x04b135cf5d88eCCEb208fc39FBA35E1881db9dDa", "created": 1633163558, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcEz9v4zuAesPif9nB8JwLzer2cEFcgNgtmHzr6h5YXNH", "voter": "0x9BF9a4B08373C11F63C7CFBada8B6Fb4a5e18b31", "created": 1633085182, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRZTZmey9aLbxoHNW8GncbxUKP5GWKsBnUeGQgJSnkYh6", "voter": "0x6e377E571B5976E56d88C7e9f367fB3Ba7c00E7A", "created": 1633077722, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTvEeqyxrXfXHnznfcpHHjqrpG4UMrQjMSQrM81UJirXV", "voter": "0x8903a20F78Ca08cFa55346c8ff596c33F4208f3f", "created": 1633077275, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZnpNxVGyScxAds7v4FjMppV8h5cjC1kyvf8oDfx1vTpc", "voter": "0xe2D27f6242E848d310B000Cc355a4C1E470FE779", "created": 1633077064, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}]}
