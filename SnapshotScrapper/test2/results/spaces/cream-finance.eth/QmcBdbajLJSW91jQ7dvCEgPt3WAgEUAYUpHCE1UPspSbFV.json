Doing so increases the usefulness of the Cream platform which attracts new users and capital.\n\nAfter analyzing the collateral factors of comparable assets on Cream, it looks like 45% is a reasonable starting point for a highly liquid governance token that is already listed on top exchanges like Binance. \n\nWe've also increased our liquidity on Sushiswap to ~$2.5M in response to offline feedback.\n\n# Previous Discussion:\n\nhttps://forum.cream.finance/t/increase-collateral-factor-of-ogn-to-45/763 ", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1614243600, "end": 1614502800, "snapshot": "11925548", "state": "closed", "author": "0x449E0B5564e0d141b3bc3829E74fFA0Ea8C08ad5", "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth", "name": "Cream Finance"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRtNacZaA6Vo12BbHXoeTRUgETMXGiheFUbZwRwF4daj7", "voter": "0x449E0B5564e0d141b3bc3829E74fFA0Ea8C08ad5", "created": 1614245679, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}]}
