Not only has the protocol been adding new assets at a breakneck pace, but also shipping new products like ETH2 staking that launched last week. This is extremely positive for the protocol and CREAM holders.\n\nHowever, with the rapid pace of development and additions, important governance proposals are slipping through the cracks - potentially overlooked by the community. As such, the community should vote to improve these new governance guidelines.\n\nI suggest that any new proposals submitted to the governance forum on Snapshot should have a minimum of 3 days for the community to vote and deliberate. Once a new proposal is submitted, the team should immediately post to all social channels: Discord, Telegram, and Twitter.\n\nThis will ensure that enough time is allotted for all CREAM token holders to gain awareness of new listings, collateral factors, rewards, and other important decisions.\n\n=====proposal is drafted by AlienWatts=====\n\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/implement-minimum-3-day-period-for-new-governance-proposals/185", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1606748400, "end": 1606834800, "snapshot": "11360679", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb6e362900B7113F246A7e1c17E9746b3B9C079dB", "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth", "name": "Cream Finance"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWdZGtWDeo5UXKLmLFPD2zCHHtqRN1qHm9LvZsddADW6S", "voter": "0xEb9105815280F533be51Bf076fA008F165d03262", "created": 1606819738, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXoPeXbmXqvg8urdGrFA6ZdYJEzZAxyDafzGzPaBe4GBb", "voter": "0x81B31e31f8a90d3DB90eBBc221569F030f4E1f25", "created": 1606819698, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVD7pD9ZwmtZeX56Li5Xtj4M5mwG1JisYbo6BFxV992KC", "voter": "0x76Da9F88e63a85Ba8BFA19F3821D5A271753D3dc", "created": 1606789760, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cream-finance.eth"}}]}
