{"id": "QmcG8NXkYaNo41BqGMfZSfMnJuTGLvDbhH93ZGRrWLHwoj", "title": "List AMP as Collateral Asset (V2)", "body": "## Abstract\n\nThis is a revision of the previously [unsuccessful proposal](https://vote.cream.finance/#/cream-finance.eth/proposal/QmYA68naWF2SYJ6YhDuGfh3b9az9F9eGeb8btrHebBixZv) submitted by @eason on 17 January 2021. The proposal was initially discussed via [community forum](https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-add-amp-as-a-collateral-asset/387), resulting in very high engagement levels (664 views, 41 replies, 160 likes). This re-submission is based on community feedback (specifically SLP and crCREAM holders) who are eligible to vote due to recent Cream voting power updates.\n\nSince AMP is a collateral token by design, it will disproportionately increase TVL to the Cream platform. Additionally, this integration can potentially enable various payments functionality within the greater Flexa network and Cream ecosystem partners and initiatives (e.g., Iron Bank).\n\n## AMP Overview\n\nAMP is a collateral token (ERC-20 compatible) that was co-developed by Flexa and [Consensys](https://consensys.net). Currently its primary use is securing the entirety of the [Flexa payment network](http://flexa.network) ([\\$140M TVL](https://www.defipulse.com/flexa)). AMP is staked as collateral for wallet projects in the [Flexa Capacity](https://app.flexa.network) contract, enabling real-time digital payments at merchants. All network proceeds are used to repurchase AMP, distributed as rewards to collateral providers. AMP is open-source and includes a novel [collateral partition strategy](https://amptoken.org/whitepaper.pdf) that allows it to collateralize value transfer without requiring tokens to be moved into staking contracts. Note, AMP was formerly Flexacoin (FXC) but there was a 1:1 swap of the tokens in Sep 2020 to upgrade the partition functionality.\n\n## AMP token and collateral contract audits\n\nTrail of Bits
