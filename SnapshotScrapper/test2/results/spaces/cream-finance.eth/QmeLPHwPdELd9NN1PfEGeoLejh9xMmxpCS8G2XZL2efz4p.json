Nominees should decide on Listings, Collateral Cap, Collateral Factors and Reserve Factors. This will enable much quicker governance decisions and also allow CREAM to avoid listing all new tokens as 0% collateral. \n\n**For**\n> Create two types of proposals with different parameters which affect the length and execution of a proposal.\nCreate a C.R.E.A.M. Listing Committee\n\n**Against**\n> Do nothing\n\n## Motivation\n\nC.R.E.A.M. community members have voting fatigue because they need to approve small changes to the protocol. Currently, the governance forum is overloaded with requests related to assets listing and Collateral Factors. Consequently, critical proposals are lost among others. \n\nThe C.R.E.A.M. protocol development process is slowed down, participation rates are relatively low, and discussion is not encouraged enough. This is mainly due to a lack of structure, order and clarity, leading to a messy governance process.\n\nCurrently, the community votes on every Collateral Factor and new asset. This has a number of issues:\n\n* Creates voting fatigue for token holders because they\u2019re asked to vote so frequently\n* Dilutes bigger governance changes \n\nCreating a listing committee will make speed up new listings. The community can still make proposals for new assets to be added to C.R.E.A.M. platform. The proposal above attempts to balance speed of iteration with avoiding a descent into plutocracy. This will onboard more collateral to increase TVL and fees.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Light Proposals**\n\nLight proposals would include:\n\n* Asset Listing\n* Reserve Factors\n* Collateral Factors\n* Collateral Caps\n\nWhat is included in governance proposals labeled as Light Proposals could evolve over time, and anyone is free to make suggestions.\n\nLight proposals would be handled by a Listing Committee, who must make a binary decision. If YES wins (at least 3 positive votes), they have to reach an agreement on Reserve & Collateral Factors as well as Collateral Cap, within 2 days.\n\n**Critical proposals**\n\nThey require more voting time, a higher vote differential, and are not handled by a specific Committee.\nThis is where the main strength of decentralized governance comes into play: community members should be able to express their opinion directly or at worst delegate their voting rights to trusted actors. Critical Proposals are the ones which must go through the full governance proposal lifecycle (we are planning to propose some updates here soon).\n\n**Listing Committee**\n\nThe 5 Nominees must have a diversified background to foster discussion while remaining flexible and agile to move fast. We believe that the ideal committee looks something like this:\n\n* 2 C.R.E.A.M. Core Team members\n* 2 active community members\n* 1 lending protocol (other than C.R.E.A.M.) active contributor\n\nThis design was inspired by the [Synthetix Spartan Council](https://blog.synthetix.io/the-spartan-council-has-now-been-elected/).\n\n*Voting*\n\nEach Nominee would receive an NFT that gives him or her 1 vote. If enough voters amend their votes such that someone who is not a council member ranks higher than a council member, then the the DAO will manually retrieve the NFT from the departing Nominee and issue it to the new Nominee, giving them Nominee voting rights. \n\nC.R.E.A.M. DAO will need to create a modified version (or custom contract) of an NFT which can be revoked and issued to EOA\u2019s (Externally Owned Addresses), signifying a wallet is part of the Listing Committee.\n\nEach parameter - Collateral Cap, Collateral Factor, and Reserve Factor - requires a minimum of three positive votes, in order to be listed. Nominees can also make proposals on new assets to list, and should discuss asset listing related community proposals in the forum.\n\nMinimum proposal length is 24 hours and maximum is set to 5 days.\n\n*Election*\n\nNominees election period would last 7 days, and would be renewed every 3 months. Existing Nominees from the current Listing Committee Epoch can remain on the Committee but will still be able to be voted out via people changing their votes in the poll.\n\nIn case of emergency, token holders can vote out a Nominee if the decisions made are not considered as aligned with the interests of C.R.E.A.M. Finance. The number of seats can be modified via an Improvements Proposal.\n\n*Limited Powers & DAO Discretion*\n\nThe C.R.E.A.M. DAO has a veto power and can require a revote at its discretion, but this should happen only in emergency situations - the processes should all be optimized to minimize this potential occurrence.\n\nRewards\n\nAssets listing, Collateral Cap, Reserve Factors and Collateral Factors are strategic parameters to ensure the longevity of the protocol. Such changes are highly related to downside risk of the whole protocol. \n\nTherefore, Nominees need to be incentivized: they will get 25 CREAM tokens per month as rewards, which would vest over a 12-month period.", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1620817200, "end": 1621422000, "snapshot": "12419041", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb6e362900B7113F246A7e1c17E9746b3B9C079dB", "space":
