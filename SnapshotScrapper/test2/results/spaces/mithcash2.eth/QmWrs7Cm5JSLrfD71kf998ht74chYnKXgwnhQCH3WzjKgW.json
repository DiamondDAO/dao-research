{"id": "QmWrs7Cm5JSLrfD71kf998ht74chYnKXgwnhQCH3WzjKgW", "title": "Transition to the new team", "body": "Dear MithCash Community,\n\nIt\u2019s time to talk about the events occurred in the past 2 months since the core team was dissolved and the current situation with the protocol.\n\nAs many already know, the first migration wasn\u2019t as pleasant and smooth as we thought at the beginning, it was a rushed release with multiple bugs, contracts not working as intended, a third pool that wasn\u2019t planned, promises not fulfilled and a lack of communication from the developers with the community.\n\nIf you sum up the critical bug reported by Curve with their V1 Metapools, it quickly demoralized the spirit of everyone involved in the project, and the only way to solve this was starting from scratch and making another migration.\n\nBut this time we didn\u2019t have the same amount of developers, resources and hands like with the first migration, and everything was basically pushed to be solved by the community without any direction or support from the core team.\n\nThe community was lucky enough to have talented developers and volunteers that decided to take action and spent countless hours in pushing the migration forward, fixing the mistakes from the previous team and keeping the community engaged with the changes.\n\nSecond migration wasn\u2019t exempt of bugs, human mistakes and contract issues. --- In fact, we had to revamp our tax system for a third time and create a closed group to do a live testing of the contracts in order to find any bugs or exploits because of the novelty of the Curve Metapools and the complexity of our tax system, that couldn\u2019t be tested offline in hardhat or a testing blockchain.\n\nAt the end, it was as demoralizing and tiring as the first migration, but most volunteers stick together and managed to ship the very first Algorithmic Stablecoin with an operative tax system in Curve Swaps. So reaching the peg, should be a lot easier than competitors working with taxes and using traditional uniswap pools.\n\nThis group of volunteers is now the current MithCash Team, and now that the last problem of the first migration has been solved, and the LPs in the first pool can perform their migration to the new pool without any issues. \n\nI believe it\u2019s time to close this chapter for MithCash, and do the necessary steps to make the transition to a new beginning:\n\n> Change the MDF multi-sig to the new team.\n\nMDF is the community treasury and should be operated by the team in function, so a new multi-signature has to be created.\n\n> Hire the current MithCash team.\n\nAs I previously stated, the current team is made by volunteers that didn\u2019t receive any payment for their work, with an exception for developers who received a bounty of 500MIS each.\n\nSo I\u2019m proposing a monthly payment of 3,200 MIS3 (8.8K USDT) to hire our current team:\n\nAdmin Lead\nHead Dev/Operator\nCommunity Lead \nArchitect\nModerators\n\nAnd a one-time bonus of 1,250 MIS3 depending on objectives completed on time at the end of the roadmap. (End of June) \n\nCurrently, these payments represent less than 1 week of income for the MDF, and it shouldn\u2019t affect the operation costs for future development, and it will establish our base monthly salaries for the team until the end of the roadmap (End of June), but in case the prices of shares raised overnight the monthly payment would be capped to 10K USDT + bonus.\n\n> Change operator to keep up with development.\n\nAs part of the transition, our head developer will take the role of operator to speed up the merges and deployments of new contracts and UI changes.\n\nThis also means he will require permissions to deploy directly to the mith.cash domain and to merge in the main repository.\n\nIn conclusion, we require a community vote to seal this proposal and to make the required changes to continue the development of MithCash.\n\nI want to thank everyone in the community for their patience and as the new team, we will work harder to deliver most of the promises made in the first migration, including a way to start paying back our debt with MIB holders.\n\nGreetings,\n\nAregus -
