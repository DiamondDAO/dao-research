SUSHI will continue to flow in as long as we remain on ONSEN.\n\nAs community leaders, we unanimously believe that making our LPs whole is essential if the project is to survive.\n\nSince the MDF belongs to the community, we will hold an vote on this.\n\nNote: The tax system in question is the one originally implemented by the core team. Our community dev team has since solved the issue with our new current tax system, and so removing liquidity from the V2 pool is working as intended.\n", "choices": ["Use MDF to make LPs whole", "Do Nothing"], "start": 1619063100, "end": 1619149500, "snapshot": "12287679", "state": "closed", "author": "0xEADeE368DB33bd12463e51fa3f574fF9E6bA2b3B", "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth", "name": "MITH Cash 2"}, "votes": 20, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXkpaYJ5X2CwL8yb2fnXCRN9VJVzHLFiLER3dMppMzBVG", "voter": "0x219F5325186eE3Fa4E28769E3a0039e1ABF318f4", "created": 1619148484, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdFK9yA7m86tGaJmi4Ag45cngcmvfr5gvvkjH14966RiH", "voter": "0xcfc50541c3dEaf725ce738EF87Ace2Ad778Ba0C5", "created": 1619135460, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaMBEp9xHmEkf6JWhPuhBFNH3Cqtu9CSpxiq3pJkMghkZ", "voter": "0xa676e8B70b7EB50fBBeB65b0435954E74DB96Df8", "created": 1619132432, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVxTgfiipSqRBVR5QYmivmmy4d4UTgABXB6tMZZj9nEJC", "voter": "0xadA85B59F0fE127b81B499aFB6a73335dEF41E74", "created": 1619131509, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVST1zz6hC5713zeuDSqHi9PWzqs5g1eNCF7a3jG3FSAB", "voter": "0x537037C5ae805b9D4CeCAB5Ee07F12a8e59A15B2", "created": 1619120635, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYf9HPt4ueMndnWGEmF37zMkJAaZPUd7yeHqwJXKjK6gi", "voter": "0xBBDE1E05d96c5C4F7e377D5EaEd21Cac08A92945", "created": 1619117972, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaRfxoPRPe17o7c9yQYDXGvcM1iy2uCnS5JVhUTBtHkuE", "voter": "0x9ADF7327A3bC935E72dC486BDa541BD88Ae4d95A", "created": 1619102234, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaDupkWaVLGnycJAxgbgkW9fL5fycmhByUqBK2QoC4wEf", "voter": "0xAABd5fBcb8ad62D4FbBB02a2E9769a9F2EE7e883", "created": 1619100011, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcgS6FywfF5cQA1J6uDdghjXrTi7TkKkXMNU8y3B3yig9", "voter": "0xac1Eb7459AF366444CC502d9b002E2eEf577C02E", "created": 1619099343, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWCQ7aL25xvrPdS2iHYupoSmtRS25SWLPDdMkUutp1xmD", "voter": "0x2EFe001fB5e81188766C9B7491eE284684913F31", "created": 1619094604, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmahYHgsEvNwtL2WjBZwzaQZSitXzXynDWeAYCtB4Acqmi", "voter": "0xf7700944B35C3F85A23E9d77beE065dc4F10d6F7", "created": 1619089760, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUwGYsBF8KFsZen7FAAKs4dkz21Kcw7RFdVhhFsiaXceV", "voter": "0x897656B1Fb6C3688e48e1DD8259f7E092364754d", "created": 1619088687, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdGag1WpxN47VfsPKofGAMtMcR3u2obA6jWfEHt9oHgRz", "voter": "0x96e3BAA591C9Cf4d5f44dd44D02A3d4cE9290ac2", "created": 1619088462, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWmmwWfoz83uWiweBcUUgaYRSZdoC43GiRcHWRhgsmZhD", "voter": "0xa13E0676E3Afed3688ba4207BAC7101aFD2d4073", "created": 1619082410, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWQVvi8ZckXgh4iwrSWR4rWWiJa6eRVvWYjsBmZD8guo3", "voter": "0x796926897F17a462a375324F849c26DE27eAcBD5", "created": 1619082387, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZovrGiAeDFwpPHtF6DucxVxpAsxBCboaKfrDVRVJKefr", "voter": "0xa7804BC65158b02817874dC8b457C71F040E3945", "created": 1619081212, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVCYC1ZUJTNDseWekbEcBxxWuPwVuuyeEVoiyiJ55XRDT", "voter": "0x43638006802776F6c86c34a892688CC58CdFAeFD", "created": 1619080723, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbuR8r4cxDcrgd2FDNab6jXZMciNJE4ybCx7tryi9WbUU", "voter": "0x807aE27C1c045f00330496A1B02E811A3a82b32D", "created": 1619076308, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZrQ3aAfvLbB2g48kjXY1997KQdjZSRJwz76VoZpFujP8", "voter": "0x4a21040B18Ba0e18B48Fb69233982756A67A0dcC", "created": 1619068093, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfDqt6dscJAvpSZbmhr92BahL6zgUxsCuhCHQGyRa7DbH", "voter": "0x4B0943930e1FF67E4D4A56E9e912B1D2E47924d4", "created": 1619065334, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}]}
