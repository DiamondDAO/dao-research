These rewards will incentivize existing users of Mithril Cash to sell before there is an expansion, so that supply will not be increased unless it is absolutely necessary. Taxing purchases of $MIC above 1.00 will fund a Peg Bonus as well as a sell reward by providing a payout of Tether to our staked ecosystem participants. Grouping together these propositions is the most seamless as many of them rely on each other, and increased $MIC stability should be a benefit of this improvement.\n\n**Logic:** Sell Rewards will be funded by a Buy Tax when $MIC TWAP is over a dollar. This reward and tax system will work similarly to how current taxes and planned buy rewards function.\n\nWhen $MIC TWAP is over a dollar:\n\n**Seller\u2019s Reward:** Each cent $MIC TWAP is over a dollar, a 1% bonus will be applied, up to a theoretical maximum of 100%. This reward will be funded by half of the Buyer\u2019s Fee.\n\n**Buyer\u2019s Fee:** Works the same way as the Sub $1.00 Sell Fee but in reverse. Also, by using this equation we ensure that the theoretical maximum price of $MIC is 2 dollars:\n\n**1-(2-Price)^2**\n\nCreating a price ceiling promotes stability, and the tax will reduce excessive buying above peg to make an expansion payment larger than the market is ready for. By using a larger fee than the reward we provide, we are able to also support existing users who are staked in our protocol by sending them the other half of the fee.\n\n**Fee payout:**\n- 50% to Sell Rewards\n- 50% to Staked Boardroom and Bondroom users.\n\nIf Mithril Cash has an expansion epoch and there are funds in the Sell Reward contract, an amount of $MIC will be automatically minted and sold to allow the Sell Reward contract to keep up with expansions. For example:\n\nIf TWAP is 1.05 during an expansion and there\u2019s 100,000 USDT in the Sell reward contract, 5,000 $MIC (5 percent of the USDT) will be minted and sold to provide funds for the expanded market. This measure is also intended to promote price stability.\n\nIf Mithril Cash has an epoch with no expansion and there are funds in the Sell Reward contract, these funds are considered no longer necessary and thus a \u201cPeg Bonus\u201d can be paid out to staked users of the protocol. This Peg Bonus is in USDT, and can occur once every 10 epochs (2.5 days) to prevent manipulation.", "choices": ["Add sell rewards", "Do nothing"], "start": 1622912400, "end": 1623430800, "snapshot": "12576185", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1a09Ce0614A53419850E107857ACb875DF00aF2E", "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth", "name": "MITH Cash 2"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUoxujqyL7ehe121nxkoHimbfRv2F5vLnfdNUkpzNrGGC", "voter": "0xaD4489f64a8be791294116D3E99D2721C7f0a72A", "created": 1623361565, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVDQwyevMMtDtqX2GJ9BAQUiyUGTqbUotRyotq1keBY9U", "voter": "0x83bAD39F067EF72e354F2EA9d318EaAD381a7F15", "created": 1623273234, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUVSQngVE8tyh28VieMLNPjoQDWfrUcVhCUAXAX4fSVPG", "voter": "0xf7700944B35C3F85A23E9d77beE065dc4F10d6F7", "created": 1623263024, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYBVXHJ1PJd2tuZdRuYzyyEeEyMGDy3MRhFK5sMnUFmEU", "voter": "0x92374BA66EE27f207F9efff0837FF6D707006304", "created": 1623206341, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb416kWaLzTEweZnjUy5FmMGakgjutFtKA6e7JtcuCbBo", "voter": "0xa676e8B70b7EB50fBBeB65b0435954E74DB96Df8", "created": 1623191869, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmarF1t6mYKnkjaUxi4ZS4CgypJjeNrJtFpn6o6u629wnn", "voter": "0xa7804BC65158b02817874dC8b457C71F040E3945", "created": 1623162833, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTTDAdV8dR4LPekGVpfvCLAhzTDqaeupujxbyMBgmEBNe", "voter": "0xadA85B59F0fE127b81B499aFB6a73335dEF41E74", "created": 1623101789, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYBu5WDG71sQ8zEnbtNF5z9ip1uYXyZFyc4pKoyCsDrSt", "voter": "0x96e3BAA591C9Cf4d5f44dd44D02A3d4cE9290ac2", "created": 1623077325, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYswWBP5jUnoov3zHnocR3XYJ2KcqvqbNufcyrzQ7bjRJ", "voter": "0xac1Eb7459AF366444CC502d9b002E2eEf577C02E", "created": 1623002059, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbYRqNGYujmHgxeJBHKcPApcf3JQxLDNtLTS3R1o79PSi", "voter": "0x1D7DE9cADc796223dcc03C07128dc6c3946448A2", "created": 1622992246, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVZxVAHkWMfJAvfazYaW2Ak3DRdt4H7yMB7FkGDSs4YK4", "voter": "0xa32369A38a872d0F4DA54301FcdA5F3172B7EAA7", "created": 1622974843, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmccdeXNhwo2edj2Puc7okWFENxJx4mtn9MzzSZZ53hvjV", "voter": "0x807aE27C1c045f00330496A1B02E811A3a82b32D", "created": 1622971914, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZiWNeKRkg57XjthBS96ZNo2YrXuk1KYiDSK7fFCu78nj", "voter": "0x4a21040B18Ba0e18B48Fb69233982756A67A0dcC", "created": 1622970964, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSBFCWBjf7MZRXNCmiNeQ1uyCAvWD1B7Rs2EHnu3vWoMN", "voter": "0x897656B1Fb6C3688e48e1DD8259f7E092364754d", "created": 1622957795, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeqK96TtWQgyiKVsMZ3ac8sFJ1Q5LjEm9L51phXYvNApM", "voter": "0x54276623b82377Ff9cD0a2a9CCB3e5b7430dDc66", "created": 1622953992, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSB8umRyH9fFbPutPGzC8tDQ7ExhXXeRs1oNtdSknvdfF", "voter": "0x78D8E8807F652B54AfE33B7645A26C5ffaE5291c", "created": 1622924604, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}]}
