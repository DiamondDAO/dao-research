Using a linear buy rewards model based off TWAP provides a simple and easy-to-understand way for rewards to be enacted.\n\n**Expected Result:** Buy rewards will attract more buyers by providing additional incentives to reach peg.\n\n**Logic:** For each cent $MIC TWAP is below $1.00, a 1% buy reward bonus will be provided. Example prices and buy reward bonuses are as follows:\n\n$MIC 99 cents: 1% Buy Reward\n$MIC 90 cents: 10% Buy Reward\n$MIC 50 Cents: 50% Buy Reward\n$MIC 25 Cents: 75% Buy Reward\n\nSo, if Sally wants to buy $MIC and the going TWAP is 80 cents, her purchase of 100 $MIC sends 120 total to her account. Later, if she makes a purchase at 90 cent TWAP, buying 100 $MIC would net her 110.\n\nThese buy rewards will be funded by 50% of $MIC\u2019s sub $1.00 sell tax. Starting from an arbitrary price and selling $MIC pays for Buy Rewards back up to said price or further, so when the rewards contract collects fees from $1.00 it can support paying out those rewards all the way up too. \n\nUnfortunately, sell fees weren\u2019t initially collected while $MIC was sold down from the $1.00 level. Therefore, the contract may require an idle period to acquire funds, or an initial liquidity deposit. It should be noted that because sell pressure is what funds the Buy Reward contract it\u2019s unlikely that the contract will run out quickly.\n\n> What happens if there\u2019s not enough $MIC in the buy rewards contract?\n\nThe contract will be temporarily shut off in order to accumulate more funds. Consider $MIC price is 60 cents, and the contract can fund rewards until 70, but it gets pumped to 80. \n\n**The reward contract will have to be shut off when it runs out, around ~70 cents.**\n\nHowever, the action of prices falling back down will then pay for buy rewards up to that peak price of 80 cents and even further. Trading in an enclosed zone will increase funds in the contract. Trading from 50 cents to 60 cents back down to 50 leaves the contract with more funds in it than it started off with, and thus can support buy rewards to a higher price level than before.\n\n> What happens if a whale calculates the maximum $MIC2 slippage the pool can take to make a return, so the whale buys a large quantity of $MIC2 and immediately dumps for profit with the rewards?\n\nTaxes and buy bonuses actually use Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP), which is much more difficult to manipulate than Spot Price. This makes it so that if someone bought $MIC from 50 cents to 90, the TWAP would still linger and charge a tax if they wanted to instantly sell.", "choices": ["Add sub MIC $1 buy rewards", "Do nothing"], "start": 1621616400, "end": 1621875600, "snapshot": "12479800", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1a09Ce0614A53419850E107857ACb875DF00aF2E", "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth", "name": "MITH Cash 2"}, "votes": 18, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPFb7JS4tEBXVKF3HpoGGtuiWWnQ98R1CXAo79KkRbUC5", "voter": "0xaD4489f64a8be791294116D3E99D2721C7f0a72A", "created": 1621855931, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmckmZJkGaTej94bcUXyyhYgqYxZjH8R9GmccPN8LJPNCg", "voter": "0x897656B1Fb6C3688e48e1DD8259f7E092364754d", "created": 1621843737, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme34E2tYrwHcWae7w5iWMaQzW5atfmow1Xxd1SJoG5hYw", "voter": "0x3474E30E06deCcDf025E095Cbb913e6CbaCF04f2", "created": 1621816808, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmahiBfRU1JgUDgdQCY7h1HCWiMqyVxtJcDAmFTo1ytRB9", "voter": "0x1D7DE9cADc796223dcc03C07128dc6c3946448A2", "created": 1621738747, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTbGRGE7SpEos5GKAdaCuVwpxozt8NY88QA3QnJzpnnRY", "voter": "0x9ADF7327A3bC935E72dC486BDa541BD88Ae4d95A", "created": 1621736119, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTasHCLS4ydxbPhXmFN8cV9A3cygLBfx9iNyLnUG6K2yh", "voter": "0x4a21040B18Ba0e18B48Fb69233982756A67A0dcC", "created": 1621703180, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaUoLds3ZpBWqd3kqB552vsJCayd5YodKvypR5XrNghUz", "voter": "0x5E0b1f370C47cffa0e7A87137E9b8036e79Caa2a", "created": 1621689066, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXe77rwBNZCBVUGt4b7RrRYjmnXA8Lu53TBkhuiVngH44", "voter": "0xa7804BC65158b02817874dC8b457C71F040E3945", "created": 1621685085, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPLsG38rhsuRqtRvptzajPyoavndgrjs7aGddzZ7Kz3bv", "voter": "0x6A774a03fA29d6074D24AA068a93De14a77a79dD", "created": 1621681198, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVtMgLJ1gsY6CNPDUSDPQBBXjG9CFaxiSeMA2rwviNn2o", "voter": "0x96e3BAA591C9Cf4d5f44dd44D02A3d4cE9290ac2", "created": 1621672737, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXc4Q9zoV8GQWtyvp31bqtkJvZ2PxG9fK7q2g4KF45oJV", "voter": "0x35d177d7147178e0bD19ecCf8E71b5AA5B8310c5", "created": 1621664536, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRazM1CMYgveAK3e3QTkiaMZcYvTUQJFaqPnTsRDQCWCt", "voter": "0x54276623b82377Ff9cD0a2a9CCB3e5b7430dDc66", "created": 1621646764, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbPXHpBwFWYfpL4YMo2LVigyeCeHppWxifn4xKZCnd1uG", "voter": "0x92374BA66EE27f207F9efff0837FF6D707006304", "created": 1621646636, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWXnjPwT4Cik5jiDZL8KcPWcUzkDEwCatWginMbKrgK4x", "voter": "0x807aE27C1c045f00330496A1B02E811A3a82b32D", "created": 1621642647, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbnuMgRQhti36SLswrgX7aN52v9m3nSFzWQP4REZD9gsd", "voter": "0xadA85B59F0fE127b81B499aFB6a73335dEF41E74", "created": 1621639619, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTd2CP2QrKsRFepZrzLXGzxWRcFz837PipsBDgETC4agQ", "voter": "0xac1Eb7459AF366444CC502d9b002E2eEf577C02E", "created": 1621632046, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb5M2kE8Pf8orEDmwSE6njgAMtSRALJNTQv25cV2BHFqh", "voter": "0x18015cF4a4967EbFbA687af88B6f8e1060294a09", "created": 1621630749, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVnRkALDdbaMDdFYpWRLtPkb8U821mxbvN93TgNu5qYt7", "voter": "0x83bAD39F067EF72e354F2EA9d318EaAD381a7F15", "created": 1621630137, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mithcash2.eth"}}]}
