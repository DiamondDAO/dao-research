This DEBASE was used instead to provide rewards to SP1 LPs. Therefore as we move from SP1 V1 to SP1 V2, we take this time to reimburse said members in terms of the percentage of DEBASE they contributed to SP1 to help it function smoothly. Vidar the Auditor will mediate the process from the DEBASE multi-sig to ensure the integrity of the reimbursement.\n\nTechnical Details:\nOn launch day of SP1 V1, the reward rate of SP1 was set to 100 times the reward rate voted on by governance. Once the issue was discovered, the issue was remedied by sending rewards back to the rewards contract leaving SP1 with no DEBASE to give till next rewards trigger. To help LPs claim the rewards given to them, community members sent their DEBASE to SP1. The transactions are as below and add up to 10,500 DEBASE, which is 0.000540148163 as a fraction of Total Supply:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xb0a9b84fd7faf9671f0559714ad5ddcef8a83ab333654c3162ff3d9b281614d9\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x90133b4d48fc9425b1b211d1b3589cf0134d6b4a3430a4a449f5e668bf9495f5\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x9b775a958ee0889997c154dca5ef5b1b71b257b6aff524815a1f72ae0ac3d7cc\n\nThe members should be reimbursed in the percentage of total supply of Debase they sent to the rewards contract, especially since their transaction history reveals they didn't mine DEBASE from SP1 V1 themselves.\nTo ensure integrity of the reimbursement, VidarTheAuditor will mediate the process from the DEBASE multi-sig.\n\nNotes:\nThe grant process will be mediated by VidarTheAuditor to ensure integrity; he will audit the smart contract written to request the grant. All assets will be first transferred from the rewards contract to the multi-sig where he is signatory.\n\nVote Yes if in favor of grant, No otherwise", "choices": ["Approve", "Deny"], "start": 1612976400, "end": 1613062800, "snapshot": "11814980", "state": "closed", "author": "0x548efCE69bb82a16f3911a86a65384327c99c3Ab", "space": {"id": "debaseonomics.eth", "name": "Debaseonomics"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNNg67YTcfgTwMNNV669bZmDykRgM3jaZUawv4LNv9Paq", "voter": "0xa4BD82608192EDdF2A587215085786D1630085E8", "created": 1613025274, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "debaseonomics.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS65xJm99GdPBmJuqFj3GA3eL2WnCtZh5xp4AEq6YhQ3f", "voter": "0x9e5024936C16A00563C7266790398A07938541Ac", "created": 1612992772, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "debaseonomics.eth"}}]}
