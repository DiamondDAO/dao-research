I was introduced by people working at ILV.\n\nImplementation Plan: Keep building upon my initial work using Typescript and link more APIs to the platform.\n\nThere will be multiple scopes of work but the next one is described as \"V2\" in this document https://docs.google.com/document/d/12nI5EPzvYubGXsYR2tRc-5kMw8xMiVV122StwJeQxyU/edit#heading=h.pdeo1jdmjhxc \n\nThere will be a \"V3\" after this one which will be implementing a CMS on top of the SIPs website to allow for even easier collaboration in the future.\n\nI propose that we keep the initial bounty amount of 1000 SNX for each of these iterations (V2 = 1000 SNX, V3 = 1000 SNX and so on..)", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1631879780, "end": 1632484580, "snapshot": "13243018", "state": "closed", "author": "0x45b15f49f7F983F0C70006D1910665E0a1A47FF5", "space": {"id": "grantsdao.eth", "name": "SNX gDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
