{"id": "QmeoXWwPfcWaUMyVjusAVncypPoav2Rn5qVuKfLMbnea1J", "title": "SIPS & SCCPS PLATFORM IMPROVEMENTS", "body": "Overview: After completing the bounty to migrate the SIPs/SCCPs platform from Jekyll to Gatsby + Github actions, which was the initial bounty settled of 1000 SNX, we want to keep improving the platform. Value: Keep iterating and improving the experience for people submitting SIPs and SCCPs, integrate with other APIs and tools relevant to the SNX community and help automate processes for people looking to improve the SNX protocol. Applicant Background: Lead level software engineer at various companies, happy to provide LinkedIn details and references in private, settled Kain's initial bounty for rewrite of the SIPs platform. I was introduced by people working at ILV. Implementation Plan: Keep building upon my initial work using Typescript and link more APIs to the platform. There will be multiple scopes of work but the next one is described as \"V2\" in this document https://docs.google.com/document/d/12nI5EPzvYubGXsYR2tRc-5kMw8xMiVV122StwJeQxyU/edit#heading=h.pdeo1jdmjhxc There will be a \"V3\" after this one which will be implementing a CMS on top of the SIPs website to allow for even easier collaboration in the future. I propose that we re-iterate the initial bounty amount of 1000 SNX fo this V2 iteration.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1632914971, "end": 1633519771, "snapshot": "13320387", "state": "closed", "author": "0x45b15f49f7F983F0C70006D1910665E0a1A47FF5", "space": {"id": "grantsdao.eth", "name": "SNX gDAO"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWMbywrDnraBUCE3npUaQXoYn8F3NQprExo2ETTb63jKJ", "voter": "0xF5a701D13Be654a534D14DE8Cd6a328293712405", "created": 1633029135, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "grantsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbxdkAVwuW7UM6LexMGp6vpwwmB6KJUx8KS8T53Tdivrr", "voter": "0x1a207bEefC754735871CEEb4C506686F044B1c41", "created": 1632948621, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "grantsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQX9i8CoXAhLR9ACFZhtSZqf8LYpyYk3XHCXGDcGK7Sxh", "voter": "0xbF49B454818783D12Bf4f3375ff17C59015e66Cb", "created": 1632917134, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "grantsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY39YqvoCZWBvo8eqVXkdYmL8nakF5BJ3djQ9gsiynYQS", "voter": "0x099DbFa498d0b7Fbdf8bC6eD9FaF868454022EC2", "created": 1632915439, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "grantsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmebAEL38YcZHf8F6fatbHYqmwfCCUEjHfiyaiUjyUVGbR", "voter": "0x4f370B4d03D2b46CcE26F1aEFE142708E03D7FFE", "created": 1632915288, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "grantsdao.eth"}}]}
