I personally had between 18 and 20 unclaimed tokens - There was no prior warning , the tokens were there last night and then gone this morning. I think this defeats the whole concept of the bonus farming - Being influenced to  invest in the project by healthy rewards and then the immoral way the rewards were 'taken' back from the account. I don't really see any difference to stealing - I/we earnt them and they were then taken. This is certainly not the way I expected to be treated by a project that has so much support from its community - and so many heavily invested... either farming or staking. \nI understand farming is high risk, high reward and the heavy depreciation of 'UP' was a big knock in itself, so to then take away the little amount (UNFI bonus) which I was collecting as a kind of compensation for the loss is a very unethical thing to do.\n\nI'm asking for the unclaimed bonus rewards to be given back - to regain the trust of the full community & from an ethical point of view it is the right thing to do.\n\nThank you", "choices": ["Approve", "Decline"], "start": 1617472267, "end": 1617562267, "snapshot": "12168151", "state": "closed", "author": "0x408E2B2F7770A6DD53F52C5248633aF93aC30aF9", "space": {"id": "unfi.eth", "name": "UNFI"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmenQecitHBXfQgfoEoZBHxqKXLCrqr5sCRTzr5dj5hiC2", "voter": "0xe774217d3CE92bdf8C98a66Ed1F077bC30C4A6D8", "created": 1617552223, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "unfi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW1zBxNgNDsbkdrWHUPWXVtPACyfkhTeRQY9JJ8HRmNvM", "voter": "0x9c5621268E1EB0274f060898c9F88Fd0ef82B027", "created": 1617520627, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "unfi.eth"}}]}
