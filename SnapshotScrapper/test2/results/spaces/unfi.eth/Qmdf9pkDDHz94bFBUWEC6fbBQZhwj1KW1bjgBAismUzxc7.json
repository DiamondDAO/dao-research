{"id": "Qmdf9pkDDHz94bFBUWEC6fbBQZhwj1KW1bjgBAismUzxc7", "title": "April Migration UP to UNFI to DRIVE Liquidity.", "body": "Did you know that the main engine of UNFI is the LIQUIDITY that is placed inside the uTrade pools on each chain?  These independent Liquidity Providers (LPs) earn a portion of the fees earned, paid to them in UP (Unlimited Potential) Tokens.  From time to time the team announces an UP to UNFI Migration.  This allows the LPs (the lifeblood of the protocol) access to UNFI so they can participate in the governance of the protocol.\n\nThe overall Liquidity, trade volume and UNFI token has been steadily decreasing since the UP migrations have been getting smaller and smaller.  The first (2 part) migration was for 100,000 UNFI [Late 2020].  The next migration was for 10,000 UNFI (yes, 10% of the original!) and every UP token tanked in market price and the liquidity (LPs) started to withdraw.  \n\nThe third migration was for 7,500 UNFI and that continued cutting of the UNFI allocated to the UP migration seemed to be the last straw as the liquidity being held in the protocol dropped by over 80%.  (There is currently $4,038,000 in LP liquidity across 7 chains!) The low migration numbers may or may not be correlated to the falling Liquidity, but here we are with only 3.36% of all UNFI in circulation (117,500/3,496,667) being allocated to the liquidity providers.  It's time to reward the ENGINE that keeps the ecosystem running and pour on some GAS.  {How can we maintain a $93M UNFI market cap with only $4M in the liquidity pools?} (UniSwap has $7.6 BILLION and CAKE has $2.35 BILLION in their liquidity pools) \n\nThe 'lottery' system of gambling on and competing with all the other LPs in these migrations is holding back the entire ecosystem.  No more games.  No more competition with the other LPs.  Let ALL early supporters of the protocol participate in Governance by giving them access to UNFI.\n\nI call for a referendum that an UP to UNFI migration be announced in April with no cap on the amount of UNFI.  \n\nUnlimited Migration \u2013 NO CAP!  Send your UP and received UNFI at a rate of 2x UP redeem in UNFI value.  The snapshot of UP redeem, base token USDV and UNFI value will happen at the same time (on or around April 15th, 2021).\n\nExample \u2013 send 1000 UPtrx with a redeem of 11.33 trx and TRX at $0.12.  \u20182x Redeem in USDV\u2019 is $2.72 per UPtrx.  If you send 1000 that\u2019s $2,719.20 in \u2018USDV\u2019 to apply to receive UNFI.  So, UNFI at $27.20 would give you 100 UNFI. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like to \u2018gamble\u2019, this is the migration for you!  Join GGM, participate in LP farming, and stake your UNFI at 36% before it fills up (again)!\n\n", "choices": ["Hell, Yeah!
