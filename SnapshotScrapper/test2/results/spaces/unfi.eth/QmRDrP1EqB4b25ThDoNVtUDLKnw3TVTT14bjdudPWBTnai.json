If at all possible, it may even use its own reserves of UP to provide liquidity where possible.\n\nETH would be a great place to start. The ETH ecosystem is very large and there is plenty of volume out there to be claimed. However, the ETH pools on uTrade have two problems that prevent both large trades and small trades from occurring. Firstly, the high fees on the Ethereum network mean that small trades are not economical. Secondly, the low liquidity in the pools leads to slippage that makes large trades equally uneconomical.\n\nIf the pools were injected with a small amount of liquidity each, I would expect to start to see movement. If Unifi can provide a 'base layer' of liquidity on higher-fee blockchains (primarily ETH and BNB), this should pave the way for volume to enter the system and for more LPs to arrive, following that volume. If this experiment fails, the liquidity can be withdrawn again for moderately little risk.\n\nCommunity members are unlikely to make a swarm effort to fill pools on Ethereum when the fees for depositing are quite high and there is the risk that volume will not pick up even if they do. If a small foundation of liquidity were provided, this should kickstart the positive cycle of volume, leading to further liquidity provision, and so on.\n\nI'd like the community to judge how important it is, in the context of the whole life of the Unifi Protocol DAO project, that liquidity is sought at this moment in time.\n\nIf the community deems this to be a high priority, then could we have a brief statement from the team detailing their opinion on this issue, and their capacity/willingness to intervene on this matter?", "choices": ["This is a high priority", "This is a medium priority", "This is a low priority", "I don't think this should be brought before the team's attention at the present time."], "start": 1621697607, "end": 1621787607, "snapshot": "12485042", "state": "closed", "author": "0x987EbeD92EC52D83DF9da87844B7FCeb10dE484F", "space": {"id": "unfi.eth", "name": "UNFI"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWVp2dMZtYpQcKpz2TH4T3YhWX716aJWNhTNGAKa6sjMg", "voter": "0x96f07C87B111585FaeedfF1a8e24fCCA5C162b09", "created": 1621761536, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "unfi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT7xqM5xmLURgDrhQanRmBuSXEZebdevTURj1SGmWEKqX", "voter": "0x987EbeD92EC52D83DF9da87844B7FCeb10dE484F", "created": 1621714763, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "unfi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaXnvP7bQKUewJbhJPYUWEScRixp9ZTo4vbPg7DkqWh8v", "voter": "0x790C57FCd83fAC182EA922506cd558d5C2e653fB", "created": 1621708530, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "unfi.eth"}}]}
