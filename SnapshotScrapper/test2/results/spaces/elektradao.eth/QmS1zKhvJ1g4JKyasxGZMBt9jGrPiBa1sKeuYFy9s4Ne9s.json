This will include the creation of basic tools for the benefit of community members to begin contributing to the DAO.\n\nWe propose that Elektra DAO establish and fund a temporary team of community designers to create a set of deliverable items that meet the need for infrastructure. Once these deliverables are created and voted into practice by the Elektra DAO, the team will dissolve.\n\n**The Vital Opportunity**\n\nWe may have found the world of Elektra in a barren state, but it contains limitless potential for creation and growth. Before we as a DAO can start filling this world with color, it's important that we establish the system by which the Elektra DAO governs itself. We believe forming a temporary committee will allow a few individuals in our DAO to focus their intent on developing and presenting a governance system that works for all of us. We believe this will be an efficient and effective way to create healthily as a community as soon as possible.\n\n**Milestones & Funding**\n\n*timeline and funding estimates are tentative, pending DAO consideration and voting*\n\n**Phase 1:** Establish Mission, Vision & Values (2-4 weeks)\nCommunity-wide workshops to discuss mission, vision, and values (everyone has a chance to weigh in)\nCommunity design team synthesizes and finalizes Elektra\u2019s Mission, Vision and Values; share as proposal (committee consolidates community-wide sentiments into a mission statement)\nMission, vision, and values will be ratified through on chain voting\n(everyone votes the mission statement into a permanent guideline)\n\n**Phase 2:** Create Governance Docs (4-6 weeks)\nDraft Elektra\u2019s Proposal and Governance Process and Community Handbook; present to community for feedback/revisions\nFinalize all governance docs based on community feedback\nDissolve the team and exit to the community\n\n**Payments**\n\nThe temporary governance team suggests an amount of 1000 $ELEKTRA and 1.5 ETH for this project. \n\nAn example schedule of payment is as follows: \n\nAt completion of Phase 1: 500 $ELEKTRA and 0.75 ETH\nAt completion of Phase 2: 500 $ELEKTRA and 0.75 ETH\nTotal Payment: 1000 $ELEKTRA and 1.5 ETH\n\nSplits of the project amount will be determined using Coordinape for each phase. Payments will be made to the contributors Ethereum addresses. Addresses will be shared publicly when completing payment. \n\n*Note: There isn't yet a system dictating how much Elektra tokens should be distributed per project. We have opted to ask for a conservative amount of Elektra while that system is developed because we want to be able to get to work on this. If it's found down the road that this work was worth a different amount of Elektra than what we received we can discuss rectifying that as a community. Any decisions to balance Elektra compensation for this project will be made via new proposals and community consensus.\n\n**Use of funds**\n\nFunds will be used to compensate high commitment (Tier 1) community designers for their time, effort, and contributions to the governance structure of the Elektra DAO. Tier 2 (lower commitment) may also receive compensation if they provide a higher level of contribution.\n\n**Team Members**\n\nThese members have shown interest/experience in governance as well as provided meaningful value in the Elektra project. Many folks on the team contributed and collaborated in Camp Elektra as artists, developers and/or strategists.\n\nTier 1 Members (high commitment, 6-10 hours/wk, will receive compensation):\n\nMark Redito - Facilitator/Resident Gardener. \nPeace Node - Facilitator/Visual Communicator.\nGreydient - Project Manager. \nIvana - Design Thinker and UX\nWill Juergens - Messenger, Scribe, Distiller\nJack (Jackintheway) - Resident Philosopher & Simplifier\n\nTier 2 Members (lower commitment, 1-2 hours/wk, may receive compensation):\n\nNicole - Strategic thinker and exit to community scholar. \nIara - Culture Advisor\nMetsa - Resident Creative and Web 3 generalist\nAlex Purdy - Web 3 Scholar\nMax (Handsome Grandson) - Web 3 Scholar\nBas - Web 3 Music Scribe\nPlanteater - Web 3 Scholar\n\n**Accountability**\n\nMembers of this committee will attend the weekly Elektra DAO community calls and provide updates on our milestones as we make progress. We understand that failing to deliver on a particular milestone will result in no compensation. We will also work with community members to ensure updates are distributed through Elektra\u2019s communication channels and made available to all members.\n\n**Why should Elektra DAO fund this?**\n\nIn the absence of definitive hierarchical leadership, our purpose, principles and process will be our guiding light; our north star. Establishing these structures early on can offer a way for our community members to reach consensus, establish clear direction and create pathways to pursue meaningful projects. Investing in this initiative provides the members of this committee the bandwidth and time to focus their intent into providing a strong foundation for the Elektra DAO.\n\n\nProposal prepared by:
