There are three levels of involvement, with involvement credit values:\n    \n    Full Time - 1 involvement credit\n    \n    Part Time - 0.5 involvement credits\n    \n    Advisor - 0.25 involvement credits\n    \n2. Profits will be distributed to all involved participants pro-rata to the proportion of involvement credits they hold in the given project. \nFor example if there were 2 Full Time, 2 Part Time, & 2 Advisors on a project, the total involvement credit value would be (2 * 1) + (2 * 0.5) + (2 * 0.25) = 3.5. Therefore the profits would be divided by 3.5 and divvied up accordingly. \n3. These values will be further augmented by a multiple based on the tier of client they are relative to:\n    \n    A Tier - 1x\n    \n    B Tier - 0.75x\n    \n    C Tier - 0.5x\n    \n4. One may only have a single Full Time involvement credit at any given moment, regardless of tier.\n5. Growth Hackers and above may have a maximum involvement credit balance of 1.5. Junior Growth Hackers & below may have a maximum involvement credit balance of 1.", "choices": ["Approve", "Reject"], "start": 1633703400, "end": 1634135400, "snapshot": "18473775", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb46dd29Bf9463E9d230cc6aab4125451Fc8a3345", "space": {"id": "myceliumgrowth.eth", "name": "Mycelium Growth"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUxd9KjQWNqChFhZonUTAas5GX35gEyr68GKTdwZoJoMc", "voter": "0xA40eaCD6C5a9331C4905A1ee2DE7A6Fb8Fa3aB7f", "created": 1633893726, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myceliumgrowth.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQc9YMHwAxQz9PMGFF4fzaEQqobkUnpvT5n4twbfFcTcs", "voter": "0xd26Eeb7C4eF2Eeb0aff3C0C93E80bE8E6fd4ea00", "created": 1633725196, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myceliumgrowth.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYMb146fgxj82mrj9Hcf8eZDxPWpH1mqesLRSQY5WEHnF", "voter": "0xdc29DF75aa99B67fe8C6745BECe4D8376aD6E080", "created": 1633724020, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myceliumgrowth.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfCQsHYRD7WZ8ZhTCW6Pzqn3pKgJbS2nKvEuYAWptzRA7", "voter": "0x0C36319079e93c40A10A4F4a33E11bB8d56c9024", "created": 1633719091, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myceliumgrowth.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQiKAQ3CK7kKqoFY1uCKXMjWjmK7nTL1PsDktbvQAprJM", "voter": "0x0d7E43a488C6795320b1d97De8ff1f326f1f5F7c", "created": 1633718382, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myceliumgrowth.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYQZW4ZatNVMtiYmyxrJxVjaHZcVZM7Kuu7rSS98fUiSt", "voter": "0xb46dd29Bf9463E9d230cc6aab4125451Fc8a3345", "created": 1633718208, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myceliumgrowth.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd6cj1v499eHerMqJpPWcndwwe3rD3CirMJsKUMJWqADV", "voter": "0x0a87F8A98BDD6F0bb94AeC770AC700262Ee60a98", "created": 1633718164, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myceliumgrowth.eth"}}]}
