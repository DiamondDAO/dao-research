{"id": "QmaQ9vLgW7HVpAbjmH4WqX5gAGdUim1PFRpoy6cG9xKPsy", "title": "$CULTUR Season 1 Proposal", "body": "# **Summary**\nThis Proposal is for Season 1 of The Culture DAO, beginning on October 29th with the Virtual Beings and Virtual Societies Summit and running through the end of the year. \n\n# **What is The Culture DAO**\nThe Culture DAO exists to drive innovation and creativity around avatars, virtual beings and metaverse identity. \n\nIt\u2019s a long road from Twitter pfps (profile pictures), Fortnite skins, vtubers and chatbots to true avatars, virtual beings and metaverse identity. \n\nThe bottom-up innovation and creativity of The Culture Guild, operating as a DAO, will get us to that future faster than any one company ever could. \n\n## **Specifics**\nIntroduce the first Committees of The Culture DAO, each committee will receive a budget of 250 $CULTUR for the season and can make separate proposals for further budgeting:\n\n - **Avatar Committee**\u200a\u2014\u200a Focusing on virtual beings, avatars and metaverse identity. Examples of early projects for this committee may include (not limited to) tooling around vtubing, metaverse interoperability, creating branded avatars that signify Culture DAO membership within the greater metaverse community, and avatar drops or bespoke avatars. \n\n - **Hackathon Committee**\u2014 Organizing a prize incentivized hackathon for projects and tools based around avatars, virtual beings and story. The Culture DAO will offer support in various forms: from access to vault NFT-based characters, to possible NFT minting or financial backing for tools that contribute functionality to The Culture DAO community. Folks who complete their hackathon project and hold $CULTUR (less than the official 25 $CULTUR - perhaps 15 as a cutoff) and receive a hackathon Proof of completion NFT will be allowed to join the Discord as full members.\n \n- **Story and Single Character Committee** \u200a\u2014\u200a Building out one specific fictional character as a DAO: \u200afrom pitch to full-formed character, votes every step of the way. Unlike the avatar committee which will be creating individual, privately-owned, avatars, this committee will focus on creating a fictitious virtual being that might appear on social media, message with people as an AI, and/or appear in short films or games. All created avatars will be managed by DAO members. This committee is also more generally exploring how story development can work in a decentralized way. \n \n- **Virtual Beings Summit/Events Committee**\u200a \u2014 Planning and promoting the Virtual Beings Summit (virtual-beings-summit.com) and other virtual or in person social events that may occur throughout a season. Folks who purchase a ticket to the summit and hold $CULTUR ( less than the official 25 $CULTUR - perhaps 15 as a cutoff) and receive a summit Proof of attendance NFT will be allowed to join the Discord as full members. \n \n- **Incentive Design and Tokenomics** \u200a\u2014\u200a Building out a plan for bounties and incentives for virtual beings, avatars and metaverse identity and tech projects. Determining how to progressively decentralize the community in a transparent, incentive-driven way. Ensuring a stable liquidity pool on decentralized exchanges and creatively expanding on the utility for the native token (i.e. people using  $CULTUR to purchase AI powered NFTs).\n \n\n## **Other Committees in various stages of development**\n\n - **Security / Vault** \u200a\u2014\u200a Providing members who possess 1000 - tokens or more with owner usage rights for current DAO NFT assets:\n*CryptoPunk #2156\nFLUF World #8222\nMutant Ape Yacht Club #23134\nChromie Squiggle #7965\nMeebit #16271\nMetahero Mintpass*\n\nAnd future NTF assets acquired. The Security side of the Committee manages and optimizes the security of the Treasury.\n\n- **Learning** \u200a\u2014\u200a Employ a Masterclass model that includes lessons for DAO members around avatars, virtual beings and digital identity. \n\n- **Marketing** \u200a\u2014\u200a Organize partnerships, events to raise public awareness, advertisement and other promotional materials. Determine appropriate times for organic growth versus strategic growth. \n \n- **Contingency and Operational Expenses** \u200a\u2014\u200a Recognizing that new ideas may come up in the course of the season, this expense enables flexibility and the ability to move quickly. 500 $CULTUR will be budgeted for contingency and operational expenses.\n \n- **Liquidity** \u2014 A stable liquidity pool is essential for the $CULTUR token to avoid wild volatility swings. This means that treasury diversification is vital. Over the course of the season up to 5,000 $CULTUR will be diversified to $ETH or $USDC. \n \n\n## **Vote**\n\n**Yes** - Vote Yes on the above committees, on the funding of them at 250 $CULTUR each, and for up to 5,000 $CULTUR to be sold for ETH by the community treasury to fund the liquidity pool. \n\n**No** - Vote no.\n", "choices": ["YES", "NO"], "start": 1634846400, "end": 1635278400, "snapshot": "13463212", "state": "closed", "author": "0xCe06624718AF906A3D168CCC2CAbB5b3f9d9cC7b", "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth", "name": "The Culture DAO"}, "votes": 19, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmcsdRqcVFx2wATqAv94MuFL4SmWGxDE83QKhoh6UHfAs9", "voter": "0xd502079a1c7cc86291CeD01F0e818b60deAe6a31", "created": 1635278165, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdsHCapT4BoD7LnuYA4zJcuu978jdf65PSbdj7e7195V1", "voter": "0xE8c77e0eAbD6d8b2F54343152a8b213d3a42E54E", "created": 1635267502, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYEBNEuwKZJnNj9BHmzdBkiShWhNvBjD2FZfeykTBNf1Q", "voter": "0xB9A0fe2De684a8a76030ac279587D73656ed1787", "created": 1635194077, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXCydDcHerKNeFu66NzLxmPXkiR2q6ZKqPMKBfvG5BbyB", "voter": "0x12bF5677f57624a86F0A1f32FB65052c1e3c342D", "created": 1635104201, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNnx9h87zyxj8HNm3PaBvu6djqaYfj5cn2nHm2uyiJ3cg", "voter": "0xCeD6C281E412b985b9EcA11F7F1b697d438AFA4B", "created": 1635060054, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVY4Zh3B3UssPFUHKA5XJPSc35n2ScN7yJLFiZQoMGF5N", "voter": "0x95875a6dEfE967F132427557C539FC3d0129AA8d", "created": 1635045817, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYoMyiPKLayLaryDrNYUFo16T9E8eZXsiTv3zwtPKCukM", "voter": "0xbC872C64765B7ae2432Ca4edA8cCBC2FE6C97BAD", "created": 1635039634, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUnkHqRQ6UrFUzRNURRZnpPWhGS96HyQEpiEWHQjCHcMP", "voter": "0xce66C6A88bD7BEc215Aa04FDa4CF7C81055521D0", "created": 1635031253, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdmQgqKKcGRCxv9rkrENqC87G4rEiJtHSYp5FxW9nHTKg", "voter": "0xDacba2D90F279a5C1CecFd1b2324418fc75a4b9a", "created": 1635017081, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbhAQzavdg8wbbUTvqueaEZ41cR21YcoPqWYXoSM5b8Vj", "voter": "0x87d8629E0B1412A858AE75BF80F682e3b82282ab", "created": 1634995760, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUKLwb4S4x4zW3UTZBretjK4k69Z3eCbsL92e8yCEaGJ8", "voter": "0xA03685C6Be1bbcd9AB9eeF09B457de4E2e7C3074", "created": 1634951728, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZRPjV5VLLPT6BS2Z2dniKbeMvCEpdXH145j98ABHESjv", "voter": "0x4dec8324DB969d291bF52FeE2c51ab1f0aEb82d2", "created": 1634946757, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZUA9Ktbkrjmhfn6ULgdcgZL2RzhDAr3VuNFcmkkcG3gH", "voter": "0x16ACA01969C2a466Fa3B42fB888705B4A27B4A4F", "created": 1634945397, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmdc5WTrbxQbQHwEsbUYw2jmupTERRFxPiyg97bMqx3edp", "voter": "0x3b6CD71239AA09C220A587AdA5aCB68C78B6E8FD", "created": 1634944943, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ5iUh3AMF8bzm1CQMX5TDHXngyu9YJWUJE2jG4kQibqT", "voter": "0x3cE8202824fD5673788F9e014d2d37ea18C2AFc5", "created": 1634927224, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNNvrejhneupchtzZqTkRHeipaU4gEkffksaJrLLTYKqP", "voter": "0xA287C992Edcc454f3c1a4278b1b9149A991A7B12", "created": 1634901617, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSk48vT7aRqELuBTAvSC9pHX7MpLho3AcqiJvpoe6To4m", "voter": "0x3bfC06a9067A36F7bF591089393b18d9871B5A67", "created": 1634855052, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmekGzDiqyBcte9nMiF4Maia8xJff8rVNMWgdxoBwwTLPA", "voter": "0x5c59193De08E1320a2eC0BccB9fc5D4f12454f26", "created": 1634850367, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme2u3xgjN7wCq8x2afBpbrnSDfULeRCg1N4k2jNyTe6Xf", "voter": "0xCe06624718AF906A3D168CCC2CAbB5b3f9d9cC7b", "created": 1634849089, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theculturedao.eth"}}]}
