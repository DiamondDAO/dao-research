We could use these collected fees first.\n\n**Please note:** _the payback of debts will be gradual in the next weeks to come. This may require the sale of $COVER from the treasury. However, we will talk to each lender whether they accept $COVER as payment._\n", "choices": ["Use extra $COVER only", "Use collected Dai first + extra $COVER"], "start": 1606374000, "end": 1606546800, "snapshot": "11332555", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2f80E5163A7A774038753593010173322eA6f9fe", "space": {"id": "cover-protocol.eth", "name": "Cover Protocol"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
