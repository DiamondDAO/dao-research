It would allow for less variation in the liquidity amount and ensure long term longevity of BOO.\n\n**About Olympus pro:**\nOlympus Pro is the new industry-standard platform to help protocols acquire their own liquidity. Protocols no longer need to pay out high incentives to rent liquidity, while also guaranteeing the permanence of liquidity to facilitate transactions.\n\nOlympus Pro solves these liquidity problems by providing bonds-as-a-service for a small fee.\n\nInstead of staking their LP (liquidity provider) tokens for farming rewards in a pool 2, users can exchange their LP tokens for the protocol's governance tokens at a discounted rate. This is done through a process called Bonding. As the protocol never sells these LP tokens, the liquidity is effectively locked within its treasury.\n\nYou can learn more about it here :\n* Website : https://www.olympusdao.finance/pro\n* Doc : https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/\n* Twitter : https://twitter.com/OlympusDAO\n* Discord : https://discord.com/invite/6QjjtUcfM4\n* Medium : https://olympusdao.medium.com/\n\n**Further Details:**\nIf passed, BOO will be included in the Olympus Pro platform on Thursday, November 4th\n* 9300 BOO will be allocated from the DAO share.\n* Users will be able to acquire BOO at a discount by vesting their BOO-FTM spLP tokens over a 5-days vesting period\n* Discount is determined by the market, based on Supply and Demand\n* At the end of the vesting period, the DAO would own the BOO-FTM spLP tokens\n* Olympus pro takes 3.3% fee on LP tokens used for bonding\n* Duration : 31 days. We would launch another vote roughly 1 week prior to the trial ending to see if the community decides to extend the offer and/or modify allocations.\n\nAfter this duration we could consider allocating a portion of farm emissions to Olympus Pro permanently for the DAO to continuously acquire BOO-FTM liquidity.\n", "choices": ["Yes, proceed", "No"], "start": 1635782400, "end": 1635976800, "snapshot": "20805982", "state": "closed", "author": "0x95478C4F7D22D1048F46100001c2C69D2BA57380", "space": {"id": "spookyswap.eth", "name": "SpookySwap"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
