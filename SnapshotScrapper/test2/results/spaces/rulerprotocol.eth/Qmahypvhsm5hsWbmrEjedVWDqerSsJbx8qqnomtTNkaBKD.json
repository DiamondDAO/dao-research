{"id": "Qmahypvhsm5hsWbmrEjedVWDqerSsJbx8qqnomtTNkaBKD", "title": "Compensation Proposal for Cover and Ruler Protocols", "body": "Background\nIt\u2019s been 2 weeks since the Cover and Ruler team suddenly announced they decided to shut down their project. Collar Finance is planning to either take over or restart these projects, and has been preparing to do so since the shutdown announcement. We have submitted proposals on snapshot and have gotten some positive feedback.\nTheir remaining team posted their next steps (tweet here) but the compensation being offered is not comparable to the token holders\u2019 loss of value caused by the shutdown. Collar Finance is an experienced development team with a deep understanding of the Ruler/Cover mechanisms due to our protocols\u2019 similarities, and we are in the unique position of being able to leverage our own growing protocol\u2019s synergistic potential with Ruler/Cover. Our project is still in its early stage, but as an offering of support to the Cover/Ruler communities we have decided to offer a percentage of our future governance token COLLAR to Cover/Ruler token holders.\nProposal Details\nCOVER/RULER holders will be able to deposit their tokens in a pool to swap to the mock COLLAR token, and meanwhile hold their COVER/RULER position for up to 2 years. This means that they can withdraw their original assets at any time over the next 2 years as long as they repay the same amount of mock COLLAR they swapped from the pool.\nThis mechanism is designed for users who are undecided on selling their COVER/RULER, but who also want to lower risks of losing asset value by holding them. COVER and RULER holders are eligible for:\nDepositing COVER/RULER tokens to receive mock COLLAR tokens, with 1:1 conversion ratio.\nRetaining access to their COVER/RULER for future withdrawal.\nIn the future, users will have two options when it comes to their deposited tokens\uff1a\n1. Convert the borrowed mock COLLAR token to COLLAR after it is listed.\n2. Swap back to their COVER or RULER.\nProposal Benefits to COVER and RULER Holders\nLower risk, low cost, and flexible options for all participants.\nCOVER/RULER holders have the right to swap to a newly launched token and are also allowed to withdraw the assets they deposit at any time. They incur few costs for the entire process. The swap process will only cost borrowers (i.e., COVER/RULER holders) a 0.01% nominal swap fee (cost in COVER/RULER). This fee is charged only for protocol security purposes.\nAn automatic, transparent, secure, process conducted via smart contracts.\nThe swap will be enabled by the Collar protocol. All transactions will be processed through smart contracts that have been fully open sourced and audited. All funds will be held in non-custodial pools.\nNo disruption to current circulating COVER/RULER tokens.\nThe issuers of mock Collar (Collar Finance) in exchange for COVER/RULER do not have access to the deposited COVER/RULER tokens since it is locked in the smart contract. Their tokens cannot be dumped on the market for profit. The lending of mock Collar for COVER/RULER does no harm to the current COVER/RULER secondary market.\nFuture of the Token Swap\nCollar Finance has not yet launched the official Collar protocol or issued any COLLAR governance tokens yet. The two proposed compensation pools will be offered as a beta service available before the official launch of Collar. The mock COLLAR obtainable through this proposal represent shares of COLLAR tokens when it is officially launched, with the ratio determined at the time of launch. Any participant is free to convert their mock COLLAR or withdraw their RULER/COVER at any time within the 2 year duration of the compensation pools.\nThe compensation pools will be launched in the Collar DApp later this week.
