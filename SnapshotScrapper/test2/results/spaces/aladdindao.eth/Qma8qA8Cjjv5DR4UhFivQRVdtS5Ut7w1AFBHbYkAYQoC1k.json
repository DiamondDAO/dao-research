However the project needs to be nominated by at least one boule member to initiate voting process.\n\nEach boule member has 4 votes every month. They vote through ALDVOTE. As such, boule members need to consider their choice carefully and only vote for the project that they have most convictions on. They can either upvote or downvote a project.\n\nFor any project to be listed on Aladdin for liquidity mining, they must fulfill at least one of the following criteria:\n1. Over 50% of boule members vote and a majority of the votes are \u201cYes\u201d.\n2. The percentage of \u201cYes\u201d votes is 20% more than the percentage of \u201cNo\u201d votes\n\nThese criteria ensure that sufficient consensus can be achieved, given the high costs associated with listing new projects. They also prevent potential attacks and collusions during the voting process.\n\n***Veto***\nDecision overturn: If any boule member strongly disagrees with the Boule\u2019s decision, they can call for a vote by all ALD token holders. A decision can be overturned if the below conditions are met:\n1. A quorum of over 20% circulating token holders participating\n2. Over 51% agreement\n\n***Project 1: Ribbon Finance***\nWhat is Ribbon Finance?\nRibbon uses financial engineering to create structured products that deliver sustainable yield. Ribbon's first product focuses on yield through automated options strategies. The protocol also allows developers to create arbitrary structured products through combining various DeFi derivatives.\n\nIs Ribbon Finance secured?\nThe smart contracts are audited by OpenZeppelin, Peckshield, ChainSafe and Quantstamp.\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.ribbon.finance\nWhitepaper: https://docs.ribbon.finance\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ribbonfinance\n\n***Project 2: Mcdex***\nMCDEX is the first fully-permissionless DEX for trading perpetual contracts, powered by MCDEX's revolutionary AMM technology. They are a decentralized perpetual swap protocol with top market liquidity and offer users up to 15x leverage.\n\nOfficial Website: https://app.mcdex.io\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MonteCarloDEX\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/uut3V3D\n\n***You may only cast one vote(either Yes/No) for each project, otherwise it will be considered invalid***", "choices": ["Ribbon Finance Yes", "Ribbon Finance No", "Mcdex Yes", "Mcdex No"], "start": 1634562000, "end": 1634821200, "snapshot": "13442020", "state": "closed", "author": "0x561ADa4B0243F1d83dF80D1653E9F76E84128b0b", "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth", "name": "AladdinDAO"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTh1x3axQ5tdXqm6DWq7182WGSiJ9h1okMthkkhVioF4h", "voter": "0x51BFa1C800fAa110086150a33c837082C7C3c306", "created": 1634816757, "choice": [3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZVRxeb23YJ1kDdMivSp1tTn3hKbrmNfzWQ6q4ot38NFu", "voter": "0x8EcAB7B8ed8215cA52500cbf1548B9239173ef82", "created": 1634816750, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYDHDFp78cBknNCZ8CYMBkgcDyZeFAcc1x7csjEcKHtSe", "voter": "0xBbF102943e318258aAf34cFFbBA2244c7E72B36E", "created": 1634815137, "choice": [2, 4], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXBd4QCoTCSkJZ22pyFbofP5xfXDMwNgvewLsDnZootSJ", "voter": "0xb718727E7C8A4646D41d8b0BE5e8e2c028B9EFAA", "created": 1634697999, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWiminF433QHyS1KeL6gWoqShNNj9sj8oPrEzp7F4pUp4", "voter": "0xeF0Ca09fbf9a5f61E657Fb208b46b8685c1d4766", "created": 1634680019, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZj8Nod2qY9TsYDvKXZVucighT8ghb7NuKa2nMhQ44umf", "voter": "0xDA2f0b41B1bd01A63e07F52a2DabA34474c36657", "created": 1634675747, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSw1kMpid6sQax7pCp7WPdA5JDvhjPNddC3sXhzMY6MLr", "voter": "0x174EcfB54875CBC36FA820B6B8Ad11d22223665B", "created": 1634673047, "choice": [4, 1], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTnsWxi4ZjNNtPeAiMabRncan7qYDYQpmkN3MuMq6CX8C", "voter": "0xe1Bda804bAFae1086B4e24Db5c122452A8c62945", "created": 1634644072, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTCNkszWCB3xfRxbgusuLqywc3SpaSA7AXm6ksN9xeMNK", "voter": "0x3035A1bBd824041B07f8Ab2297a71A81E00127c5", "created": 1634626412, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSqwAVcNrmU1EkPzryD7siGhQEemgi5gzyKQTapFWwBGW", "voter": "0x0723e725Bdd7857D0746f4063e23afbce0c06D0a", "created": 1634616195, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYxrjxenR4TFftVp3F6SyHURkubMTei1dtjAyMWwARygA", "voter": "0x7449eB9cF8c9FeCe5F05105233B4DF614a301dab", "created": 1634577067, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWV6kpytcMjGZbqGBM58nWWLPdajhJYVyfgJJToYYWXUm", "voter": "0xcCd72BeA12f3927063bE3D8798a4b74082713cb5", "created": 1634575726, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSdiko6JxXmJPAp1vGWQBDEnqn79uLJLyGydkHA97aGQ1", "voter": "0x4839460F05b2a8fC1b615e0523EbC46eFba75420", "created": 1634572913, "choice": [2, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}]}
