However the project needs to be nominated by at least one boule member to initiate voting process.\n\nBoule members vote through ALDVOTE. They can either upvote, downvote or be neutral to a project.\n\nFor any project to be listed on Aladdin for liquidity mining, they must fulfill at least one of the following criteria:\n1.  Over 50% of boule members vote and a majority of the votes are \u201cYes\u201d.\n2. The percentage of \u201cYes\u201d votes is 20% more than the percentage of \u201cNo\u201d votes.\n\nThese criteria ensure that sufficient consensus can be achieved, given the high costs associated with listing new projects. They also prevent potential attacks and collusions during the voting process.\n\nSince 31 OCT 2021, if boule think they don\u2019t have enough information about the project or if they are neutral to the project, a neutral vote is added to the yes or no vote. Neutral votes will not be used to calculate boule member performance.\n\nHere is the details about the new change:\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/aladdindao.eth/proposal/0x85ddf0750dee14e450f10ea2e44645dd382b04f42daf5bb49e6647b0d5906fc2\n\n***Veto***\nDecision overturn: If any boule member strongly disagrees with the Boule\u2019s decision, they can call for a vote by all ALD token holders. A decision can be overturned if the below conditions are met:\n1. A quorum of over 20% circulating token holders participating\n2. Over 51% agreement\n\n***Project 1: Risk Harbor***\nRisk Harbor is a risk management marketplace for decentralized finance (DeFi) that utilizes a completely automated, transparent, and impartial claims process to protect liquidity providers and stakers against smart contract hacks and attacks\n\nWebsite: https://www.riskharbor.com\nWhitepaper: https://github.com/Risk-Harbor/RiskHarbor-Whitepaper/blob/main/Whitepaper.pdf\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/riskharbor\nMedium: https://medium.com/@riskharbor\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/7aAC4p6vsr\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/risk.harbor/\n\n***Project 2: NAOS Finance***\nNAOS Finance facilitates DeFi lenders and SME borrowers to allow both parties to interact in a permission-less manner on the blockchain. We enable the origination and funding of loans without traditional intermediaries. NAOS Finance provides lenders with stable and recurring income streams while also connecting the on-chain world with much bigger off-chain opportunities. Ultimately, our goal is to fully automate the tokenization of real-world assets and make them available as part of the end-to-end lending process through NAOS Finance.\n\nOfficial Website: https://naos.finance\nWhitepaper: https://medium.com/naos-finance/introducing-naos-finance-75d3e3a1b0ab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/naos_finance\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/rRaPwCVTaA\nMedium: https://medium.com/naos-finance\nGithub: https://github.com/NAOS-Finance\nTelegram: https://t.me/naos_finance\n\nHere is some introduction about projects above in AladdinDAO\u2019s Boule Research Meeting. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x48bSO_iQY\n\n***You may only cast one vote (either Yes/No/Neutral) for each project, otherwise it will be considered invalid.
