However the project needs to be nominated by at least one boule member to initiate voting process.\n\nEach boule member has 4 votes every month. They vote through **ALDVOTE**. As such, boule members need to consider their choice carefully and only vote for the project that they have most convictions on. They can either upvote or downvote a project.\n\nFor any project to be listed on Aladdin for liquidity mining, they must fulfill at least one of the following criteria:\n\n1. \tOver 50% of boule members vote and a majority of the votes are \u201cYes\u201d.\n2. \tThe percentage of \u201cYes\u201d votes is 20% more than the percentage of \u201cNo\u201d votes\n\nThese criteria ensure that sufficient consensus can be achieved, given the high costs associated with listing new projects. They also prevent potential attacks and collusions during the voting process.\n\n***Veto***\nDecision overturn: If any boule member strongly disagrees with the Boule\u2019s decision, they can call for a vote by all ALD token holders. A decision can be overturned if the below conditions are met:\n1. \tA quorum of over 20% circulating token holders participating\n2. \tOver 51% agreement\n\n***Project 1: The Lemma Stablecoin***\nWhat is Lemma?\nLemma.Finance is a DeFi project that generates superior, sustainable yield by automatically basis trading user-deposited assets in a non-custodial way. It allows investors to diversify away from lending protocol generated yield and carries a different risk profile than Yearn for investors looking to make greater returns.\n\nWhat is Lemma Stablecoin-USDL?\nLemma is the issuer of USDL, a USD-pegged stablecoin that is decentralized, 100% capital efficient (depositing 1 USD of ETH returns ~1 USDL), and yield-bearing when staked. Users of the protocol are able to mint USDL with cryptocurrencies such as ETH and redeem USDL for 1 USD worth of cryptocurrency at all times on Lemma in a permissionless and non custodial way. \n\nTwitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/LemmaFinance\nDiscord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/K2wtWvxmRU\n\n***Project 2: Orion Money***\nOrion Money\u2019s vision is to be a cross-chain stablecoin bank - the best place in DeFi for stablecoin saving, lending, and spending. Orion Money is now working with Anchor Protocol to provide stable yield up to 20% APY. Worth noting that Anchor Rate is powered by a basket of liquid staking derivatives from major protocols like ETH, LUNA and soon SOL, DOT and more.\n\nTwitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/orion_money\nTelegram:\u00a0https://t.me/Orion_Money\nIntroduction of Anchor Protocol:https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/protocol/overview\nIntroduction by DeFi_Dad: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17tmAeLyd-LXFH4D5x7KPMhr4VxCqk8gVHf_FUjp3fkw/edit#slide=id.geb26c4c2c6_0_83\n", "choices": ["Lemma.Finance Yes", "Lemma.Finance No", "Orion Money Yes", "Orion Money No"], "start": 1633957200, "end": 1634216400, "snapshot": "13394627", "state": "closed", "author": "0x561ADa4B0243F1d83dF80D1653E9F76E84128b0b", "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth", "name": "AladdinDAO"}, "votes": 17, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTUgArjsbnyk7TtEMSjjNRjVXnQe1EFZ5ghE34RTcoufu", "voter": "0x4839460F05b2a8fC1b615e0523EbC46eFba75420", "created": 1634203336, "choice": [3, 2], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP53H5WLjRZoxZCje2P9uvwyM52uqUXSCpthHnNiZFLxP", "voter": "0xde0eab42Ec400021B6d037577e29e110F2bfA653", "created": 1634163840, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRYwn9RLsdApJ82xYwfUhTFbvx9cJaFuANx2oz2FrwKVH", "voter": "0x0723e725Bdd7857D0746f4063e23afbce0c06D0a", "created": 1634141945, "choice": [2, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmcr59R1K1AsNqdyp8bKcfXnJitkqXqFxePXoYv4cAFZzn", "voter": "0xb212296893756C6226272f38d7D436Cc693c163E", "created": 1634130307, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU64np1Vikd41uu7Kz8AYeLr89fqvQYtSQz3Dgz7brKCj", "voter": "0x5492Fc3c109accB25BeBe0a09866E194938402E8", "created": 1634106292, "choice": [1, 4], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUPAyAjEWCo1JAvajzfuQGh54CFT45Q8CNKiG2JUrnTLz", "voter": "0x09FABf8c79e141FEa3B87629a19C1deFef0B9291", "created": 1634104555, "choice": [2, 4], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZxsodxq8wKeSJ2DjKeHiuLzCeJevEcsbaVQCMhwXJ7M5", "voter": "0xe1Bda804bAFae1086B4e24Db5c122452A8c62945", "created": 1634099690, "choice": [1, 4], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcQhjifRqkUho7dkAVsmPY7hfhX24ZWSzoB5H2DCzkBj7", "voter": "0x7449eB9cF8c9FeCe5F05105233B4DF614a301dab", "created": 1634090103, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPksmUXyDzq9VeyP7xVhUup4CcmEGompCpjEetYRxjeCP", "voter": "0xd177031ea95177EBDBB3BFDceBF9BD09D08462fC", "created": 1634082964, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme5kXjLzHNZmtmGBoGfEhcidD6KYY1BJ2Mfb42BEL6htA", "voter": "0xDA2f0b41B1bd01A63e07F52a2DabA34474c36657", "created": 1634059762, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeTQepetF84Utkv15wEowbHmJKvbLXhJprv9rAKXx8pfD", "voter": "0xb718727E7C8A4646D41d8b0BE5e8e2c028B9EFAA", "created": 1634013010, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQnysM4y1PXhjqBdD1BKi3tvAofCEvcbHe3KkGQCRdERP", "voter": "0x7eAdc3aFC8C39B811e1d4FeC1f9538b388305589", "created": 1634004716, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSBieCGcQ7NgT92s1rbgsvQedj41Evs1LAXc9sSTiYTU8", "voter": "0x7Bea9a9Ca90b2FCED6e0eB8aF3198437EB016791", "created": 1633992924, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeqQqgdcnTp7xxmd3urSLTw1vKzLtEw5JodhdBrvicsZX", "voter": "0xC8d4a8970035f9F3fd01dbd238C97b5348Aa3199", "created": 1633969945, "choice": [1, 4], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYddJiYQCv6d2kXwat46MSXp2RaodvKvykkg2DCeyJdL3", "voter": "0x3035A1bBd824041B07f8Ab2297a71A81E00127c5", "created": 1633969333, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX3zFtM2SRKA7RHycfZRpK9yq5qfM3ecQYpx4APrmDK22", "voter": "0x174EcfB54875CBC36FA820B6B8Ad11d22223665B", "created": 1633967934, "choice": [3, 2], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmeef3XFvus7UHsMgAAZrQfm4Kq54dK8fGwszVufYNACmQ", "voter": "0xcCd72BeA12f3927063bE3D8798a4b74082713cb5", "created": 1633963957, "choice": [2, 4], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}]}
