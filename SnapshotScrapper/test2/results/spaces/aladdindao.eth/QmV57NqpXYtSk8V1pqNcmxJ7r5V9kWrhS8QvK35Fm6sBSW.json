However the project needs to be nominated by at least one boule member to initiate voting process.\n\nEach boule member has 4 votes every month. They vote through ALDVOTE. As such, boule members need to consider their choice carefully and only vote for the project that they have most convictions on. They can either upvote or downvote a project.\n\nFor any project to be listed on Aladdin for liquidity mining, they must fulfill at least one of the following criteria:\n1. Over 50% of boule members vote and a majority of the votes are \u201cYes\u201d.\n2. The percentage of \u201cYes\u201d votes is 20% more than the percentage of \u201cNo\u201d votes\n\nThese criteria ensure that sufficient consensus can be achieved, given the high costs associated with listing new projects. They also prevent potential attacks and collusions during the voting process.\n\n***Veto***\nDecision overturn:If any boule member strongly disagrees with the Boule\u2019s decision, they can call for a vote by all ALD token holders. A decision can be overturned if the below conditions are met:\n1. A quorum of over 20% circulating token holders participating\n2. Over 51% agreement\n\n***Project 1: Convex Finance***\nConvex allows Curve.fi liquidity providers to earn trading fees and claim boosted CRV without locking CRV themselves. Liquidity providers can receive boosted CRV and liquidity mining rewards with minimal effort. In conclusion, Convex simplifies your Curve-boosting experience to maximize your yields.\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.convexfinance.com\nWhitepaper: https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/convexfinance\nMedium: https://convexfinance.medium.com\nGithub: https://github.com/convex-eth/platform\n\n\n***Project 2: Element.Fi***\nElement Finance is a protocol which enables users to seek high fixed yield income in the DeFi market, initially focused on ETH, BTC, USDC, and DAI. Users can access, via the ecosystem and existing AMMs, ETH, BTC, USDC, and DAI at a discount without being locked into a term, allowing the exchange of the discounted asset and the base asset at any time. The fixed rate income can be secured with the exchange of any major base asset.\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.element.fi\nWhitepaper: https://paper.element.fi//\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/element_fi\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/8JnDyXJJWh\nMedium: https://medium.com/element-finance\nGithub: https://github.com/element-fi\n\nWeekly Boule Research Meeting\uff1ahttps://youtu.be/QKiz_g9Pt_Q\n\n***You may only cast one vote(either Yes/No) for each project, otherwise it will be considered invalid***\n", "choices": ["Convex Finance Yes", "Convex Finance No", "Element.Fi Yes", "Element.Fi No"], "start": 1635166800, "end": 1635426000, "snapshot": "13485773", "state": "closed", "author": "0x561ADa4B0243F1d83dF80D1653E9F76E84128b0b", "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth", "name": "AladdinDAO"}, "votes": 14, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xcbbb5c95c4acc93457ee6fde50b7b62880a3443c1b2b4a6d5a5cf890e202d32f", "voter": "0xBbF102943e318258aAf34cFFbBA2244c7E72B36E", "created": 1635421502, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x701cf1e8fc79ab3ad1ca2df6b9d2f589b103f7003fe51aa07389d3d1f390b9de", "voter": "0xb718727E7C8A4646D41d8b0BE5e8e2c028B9EFAA", "created": 1635394150, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x75b2b0e419faf34d5cf54548856af88b1b0a15d53d6c79d859d5cd29ad668d3a", "voter": "0x3035A1bBd824041B07f8Ab2297a71A81E00127c5", "created": 1635393561, "choice": [2, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWu6h2ZqHwMKZ2CjaXsMz9uev3uaoZQVjdFgDEATfizng", "voter": "0x8EcAB7B8ed8215cA52500cbf1548B9239173ef82", "created": 1635374728, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x400fc0b05c93f74977caf8607e96ff8d9631c48faab156bfb6fd0eaa688e79f6", "voter": "0xDA2f0b41B1bd01A63e07F52a2DabA34474c36657", "created": 1635373661, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xadbc9c2c6d429452f082b2645ccfcea29d873fd89a3ab58ecfe181c3dc752f4e", "voter": "0xd177031ea95177EBDBB3BFDceBF9BD09D08462fC", "created": 1635353264, "choice": [3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc3575407d58e238ded98cbd144f8f237b924bd5848154d97bd69b0ac87d6cb2f", "voter": "0xeF0Ca09fbf9a5f61E657Fb208b46b8685c1d4766", "created": 1635352406, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe503adab4d15d27513bf2aa7edbcf7987153596a7ab327994eed566e4ad5a5a1", "voter": "0x174EcfB54875CBC36FA820B6B8Ad11d22223665B", "created": 1635352095, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x922602f30d8e10aa60b9feccdfe69ed4465610494ab70697857fce8d5f2611dc", "voter": "0x4839460F05b2a8fC1b615e0523EbC46eFba75420", "created": 1635311857, "choice": [1, 4], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR5Ksr17vp7niyiudZ2VMbv4ZXsgc93B5dusRpqsFJSWL", "voter": "0xe1Bda804bAFae1086B4e24Db5c122452A8c62945", "created": 1635249312, "choice": [1, 4], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSj63SHery4kWL71cLM3WGnLee5WcdXgbgUfa6aZz1EPQ", "voter": "0x7449eB9cF8c9FeCe5F05105233B4DF614a301dab", "created": 1635240033, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXj4cXSMxqQivBYgzBr44aP1N5dgTeu5LkQAXDeSDriQj", "voter": "0x09FABf8c79e141FEa3B87629a19C1deFef0B9291", "created": 1635234557, "choice": [1, 4], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT8W5ep8sYzCXBj9zFUEFJNaabkZNX8oBA2RqUKa3RGn5", "voter": "0x0723e725Bdd7857D0746f4063e23afbce0c06D0a", "created": 1635178703, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYmAktAPGBR6BeYbwE2w7GHiiZBz6BzAi1tHbQxMh5Nbe", "voter": "0xb212296893756C6226272f38d7D436Cc693c163E", "created": 1635169740, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "aladdindao.eth"}}]}
