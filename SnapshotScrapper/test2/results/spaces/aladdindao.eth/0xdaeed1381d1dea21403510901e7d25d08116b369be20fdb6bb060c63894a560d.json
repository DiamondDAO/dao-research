However the project needs to be nominated by at least one boule member to initiate voting process.\n\nEach boule member has 4 votes every month. They vote through ALDVOTE. As such, boule members need to consider their choice carefully and only vote for the project that they have most convictions on. They can either upvote or downvote a project.\n\nFor any project to be listed on Aladdin for liquidity mining, they must fulfill at least one of the following criteria:\n1. Over 50% of boule members vote and a majority of the votes are \u201cYes\u201d.\n2. The percentage of \u201cYes\u201d votes is 20% more than the percentage of \u201cNo\u201d votes\n\nThese criteria ensure that sufficient consensus can be achieved, given the high costs associated with listing new projects. They also prevent potential attacks and collusions during the voting process.\n\n***Veto***\nDecision overturn:If any boule member strongly disagrees with the Boule\u2019s decision, they can call for a vote by all ALD token holders. A decision can be overturned if the below conditions are met:\n1. A quorum of over 20% circulating token holders participating\n2. Over 51% agreement\n\nProject 1: Badger DAO\nBadger DAO is an open-source, decentralized automated organization that is dedicated to building products and infrastructure of simplifying the use of Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral across many smart contract platforms.\n\nThe platform is a shared space where the developers, known as Badge Builders, have the ability to collaborate and implement Bitcoin as collateral to as many blockchains as possible. A developer can earn a percentage of the fees and BADGER tokens from the developer mining pool for every implementation. The mainnet was launched on December 3, 2020.\n\nOfficial Website: https://app.badger.com\nWhitepaper: https://badger.wiki\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/badgerdao\nMedium: https://badgerdao.medium.com\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/xSPFHHS\nTelegram: https://t.me/badger_dao\n\nProject 2: Rari Capital\nRari Capital is a non-custodial DeFi robo-advisor that autonomously earns users yield.
