However the project needs to be nominated by at least one boule member to initiate voting process.\n\nBoule members vote through ALDVOTE. They can either upvote, downvote or be neutral to a project.\n\nFor any project to be listed on Aladdin for liquidity mining, they must fulfill at least one of the following criteria:\n\nOver 50% of boule members vote and a majority of the votes are \u201cYes\u201d.\nThe percentage of \u201cYes\u201d votes is 20% more than the percentage of \u201cNo\u201d votes.\nThese criteria ensure that sufficient consensus can be achieved, given the high costs associated with listing new projects. They also prevent potential attacks and collusions during the voting process.\n\nSince 31 OCT 2021, if boule think they don\u2019t have enough information about the project or if they are neutral to the project, a neutral vote is added to the yes or no vote. Neutral votes will not be used to calculate boule member performance.\n\nHere is the details about the new change:\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/aladdindao.eth/proposal/0x85ddf0750dee14e450f10ea2e44645dd382b04f42daf5bb49e6647b0d5906fc2\n\nVeto\nDecision overturn: If any boule member strongly disagrees with the Boule\u2019s decision, they can call for a vote by all ALD token holders. A decision can be overturned if the below conditions are met:\n\nA quorum of over 20% circulating token holders participating\nOver 51% agreement\n\n***Project 1: Lido***\nLido is a liquid staking solution for Ethereum. Lido lets users stake their ETH - with no minimum deposits or maintaining of infrastructure - whilst participating in on-chain activities, e.g. lending, to compound returns.\n\nLDO is the native utility token that is used for:\n\uf075\t1. Granting governance rights in the Lido DAO.\n\uf075\t2. Managing fee parameters and distribution.\n\uf075\t3. Governing the addition and removal of Lido node operators.\n\nWebsite: https://lido.fi\nWhitepaper: https://lido.fi/static/Lido:Ethereum-Liquid-Staking.pdf\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lidofinance\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/lidofinance\nBlog: https://blog.lido.fi\nGithub: https://github.com/lidofinance\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/vgdPfhZ\nTelegram: https://t.me/lidofinance\n\n***Project 2: MIM***\nAbracadabra.money is a lending platform that uses interest-bearing tokens (ibTKNs) as collateral to borrow a USD pegged stablecoin (Magic Internet Money - MIM), that can be used as any other traditional stablecoin.\nCurrently, a lot of assets, such as yVaults have locked in capital that can't be put to further use.
