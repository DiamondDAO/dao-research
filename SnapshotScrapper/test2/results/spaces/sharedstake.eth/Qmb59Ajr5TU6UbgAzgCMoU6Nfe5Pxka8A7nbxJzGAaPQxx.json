This proposal seeks to stop the arbitrage.\n\nAt the moment there is an allowlist for migration. Being on that allowlist enables a wallet to instantly migrate the tokens. If you are not on the allowlist, you can migrate your tokens, but there is a 5 day delay.\n\nWe propose to remove all wallets from the allowlist.\n\nThis would then mean that a 5 day delay applies to all migrations.\n\nWe suggest that this 5 day delay decreases the risk for arbitrageurs substantially. We believe that this will stop the persistent behaviour of wallets like the one ending in 6928, and stop them suppressing the price on SGT V2.\n\nA vote of YES votes to support all the measures laid out in this proposal.\n\nA vote of NO votes against these measures.", "choices": ["YES (stop it)", "NO"], "start": 1631872800, "end": 1632261600, "snapshot": "13242699", "state": "closed", "author": "0xA5aa7454aB373a8D1287a232f3ceE46149fbdE0e", "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth", "name": "SharedStake"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQ6QBa9ckMFLveK5fhVLhE8ttFCKYdfi7RJR7f3Kfh3nf", "voter": "0x57Aabb3e7FEd58F3E55bF01bd871AD33b306Cbf1", "created": 1632071284, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRqRUHTWw9sqc13pquzkgApVvTu9HzkFjT7xrfew4SMPj", "voter": "0xB817236Ef3f092c26395a7F5B5F9041172d17353", "created": 1631921737, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRPa6GAvL9wjRQ3jVS2FKCMCETBJWYPpU6T5LAcxreTZS", "voter": "0xDdC9e804226729F774654cE6fCD01201FaFa6Dd7", "created": 1631891330, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeZwy58GYCR1xZakaDNTA7928jN712ZfMJ1NtunJ6WA32", "voter": "0xA5aa7454aB373a8D1287a232f3ceE46149fbdE0e", "created": 1631886693, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXc2ebvdUBgKV3Cvwzz2xRQZX6tAazrDByKn6ubr4NgbP", "voter": "0x6a93946254899A34FdcB7fBf92dfd2e4eC1399e7", "created": 1631886616, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdqLipKHiVLFYHrSFLVpQb8NC6FK6tkzFysfaUYjcKhzk", "voter": "0xcE507Cc4FEbD86362616b28B6D1c18AB3e2B63f0", "created": 1631882827, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}]}
