This also helps us seed matic liquidity while attracting original stakers to return. \n\nSome caveats:\n\nTo reduce unnecessary development burden, any solo SGT stakers are welcomed to send their SGT sell transaction at the time of the rug to me, Chimera, via DM on discord or twitter for inclusion in the airdrop\n\nWe will reuse the SGT-ETH and vETH-SGT LP snapshot Ice Bear created for reimbursements for tokens we managed to save\n\n80% will go to LPs, 40% to SGT-ETH, 40% to vETH-SGT. This leaves 20% for solo stakers\n\nTo limit sell pressure, a LP pool will first be created and it\u2019s TWAP price will be monitored. Instantaneous and/or TWAP price dropping by over 50% will automatically halt the airdrop\n\nAny tokens not redeemed will be returned to the DAO\n\nAirdrop will be on a rolling basis and will conclude end of October alongside TokenMigration \n\nNote: \nWe will additionally airdrop an NFT to these individuals which will boost their staking rewards regardless of the outcome of this vote. \n\n", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1634452200, "end": 1634884200, "snapshot": "13434332", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa1feaF41d843d53d0F6bEd86a8cF592cE21C409e", "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth", "name": "SharedStake"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSLn69ESXfnQ7HkMDD7smKSAkWxUvXeMpNorLu2d4hRZE", "voter": "0xd3AFAb123A5e6f6BE87291935B5FE5056bB64b6b", "created": 1634696913, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYiHAeTcxZNi3bqaSHX56e2SPrQxQUpwegt3rJwGXg9bS", "voter": "0x57Aabb3e7FEd58F3E55bF01bd871AD33b306Cbf1", "created": 1634657169, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSWXEVHih1ZuJBDuhdzNdpfLyad8dAwbHtbr3Bv43ZrD8", "voter": "0xc7b6C16b6032aC35ed5a512622272215aE860156", "created": 1634520006, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmcc8kib4rZYPyrYY6wtAKneg3tZnctPnJ1ofmff2jrEm8", "voter": "0xB817236Ef3f092c26395a7F5B5F9041172d17353", "created": 1634515868, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYAAzCD3hJhzVdgKzc6BoeXsf1hX8ApGWAoe5BUxStxx7", "voter": "0x067Ef3c16F47cca6a3ACB5942C6D4BC89Ed0A8B1", "created": 1634509402, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb2CrYRM4k4TVFMAFA17hLJKtDRJJLhJUQnnc1nHewpY9", "voter": "0xA5aa7454aB373a8D1287a232f3ceE46149fbdE0e", "created": 1634500798, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVYzJr7qpDJseyQYbQ8j4LbL1rZbtonWQodkc5QzuyWMv", "voter": "0xa1feaF41d843d53d0F6bEd86a8cF592cE21C409e", "created": 1634484486, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}]}
