Before the rugpull SIP-19, a proposal for team salary, was rejected. \n\nChimera is holding the withdrawal keys for our staked ETH and I believe we should offer him and the team funding. The goal of the funding is to secure our funds and make sure the ETH will be withdrawn to the multisig address ASAP after the ETH 2.0 merge.\nAt the moment 5% of all the staking rewards go to the sharedstake treasury. \nAll of the funding can only be paid out after the ETH has been successfully withdrawn.\n\nI propose that:\n-An additional 20% of all staking rewards are used for funding. With  16k ETH staked and an APR of 8% this is around 21.3 ETH/month.\n-This funding lasts until it is possible to withdraw the ETH from Beaconchain, even if the withdrawal keys have been changed in the meantime. \n-If this SIP passes Chimera has two weeks to publish a plan how to share the funding between himself, the rest of the team and the sharedstake treasury. He can also include SGT buybacks if he wishes to do so.\n-Chimera is responsible for making sure the validators are running well. That means we are not missing any epochs or are getting slashed. \n-Chimera is responsible for writing a monthly report about the status of our validators.\n-Chimera is responsible for withdrawing the funds ASAP after the merge and to send them to the multisig wallet\n-If it becomes possible, Chimera is responsible for changing the withdrawal keys. He and the multisig team should discuss options how to hold the keys in a safe way.\n-If Chimera fails to fulfill those responsibilities the multisig team can discuss and issue penalties.\n", "choices": ["Give Chimera + the team funding ", "Don't give them funding"], "start": 1627830000, "end": 1628434800, "snapshot": "12667718", "state": "closed", "author": "0xfA9dBab87Da24FA3716c084CC8F9cc4F5E573849", "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth", "name": "SharedStake"}, "votes": 20, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPqRYLqxWfdrQUBoht81yB6PYzr7AkCCz6M89Ts9bmSrC", "voter": "0x73849dd5790F29bdAC8502760602e4360bB6bC1e", "created": 1628376537, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmahMw2tj3iCCtPMfSBUeuAiFutSoZZRYctCAEkwtz5K1Q", "voter": "0x6e61A82AB503fA43935a9968e302C32d12f17cBa", "created": 1628351209, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPa4eFGK7bK52s7FmJTVTfDLjWTwyDhiGPU2GgSWotuUP", "voter": "0x4C135C941b642904783aBD9Ed06D86cE00B45105", "created": 1628329989, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdQvBAs2vVaeUqyJcwEcr2Ss3vQnRu6qwFUXcph4JSc56", "voter": "0xBB8FB8fE5198f25D117C0e7B1b9C8260CB19C3C0", "created": 1628281124, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXJDzcsWHBaL4fZSzwJQ4NuvgArzpYhkiGtEJrbBUdPZb", "voter": "0xBD1f7d88C76A86C60d41bDDD4819fAe404e7151E", "created": 1628208335, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbSbXJmPiQoXKHBV6NBH6ec34AeQXHRw1NEEZMXJcH77J", "voter": "0xF266DdF858284F2Fb07C7916C36CBb9D3bfDaEc3", "created": 1627963316, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRxLyQijzqAduHEjDhUoPQUfexMhJTwUv2csDM6WqZpoL", "voter": "0xB4021D39317719aACF4964A9098b79634E0eD054", "created": 1627953935, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeYn72AF6bgPB7aDTuPPBJNQiWq3x36fssrChoae6BZH6", "voter": "0xdeAa2F576a46B657aB3dE79197B745f6dF11EEf0", "created": 1627952206, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR1fJvgThGsPV73y5y4Jy1Y8CHEt89yxT273kMRRTXvg3", "voter": "0xDd9118EF8E9c738b3a70A90474C79BeaBDA5004C", "created": 1627952176, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUkBtbbHmuwnQyCXWpwxz8iyfZuCxJqQxWqSCcKSC5JBe", "voter": "0xEb78c83629694eCf185Ee4aa3a11eaC22Fc5bCC5", "created": 1627952137, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmepGSKJ9DSim5oRQp1EDyEixVhwh2NrCSvmEgsxnCiv52", "voter": "0x806388E04b7583a0148451A8ECd29A748b8fd584", "created": 1627944480, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV4HPavb12Arx1KK8osBeSMVaaThtzxwjtmWPYYcuFRYj", "voter": "0x6a934e6F1d0002193093f49a9AdDF2E7fA5Df0aC", "created": 1627925054, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXkuroTNoPAgJECPwi9ApDyLsjN5tcvkb8Zkr3usVov46", "voter": "0x39DE56518e136d472Ef9645e7D6E1F7c6C8Ed37b", "created": 1627925014, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd9zFToMNyb4xV9SrZ3SPX6rdsQmhnGwtSvnXz4Vf9FoA", "voter": "0xeabE5acB1b5b95bEb0165BC2Ac149dd5D5bB5022", "created": 1627923787, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUcPWkisFftQTXyngh92hs7oWVGuReGwPQnAuiNS9TvWb", "voter": "0x2aB37DA314572d8c1bd5B1e74B133d6Ab1491010", "created": 1627916840, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXu5dA6FHv1ybSJHstu7S3oqqsWazVMyx4LuGbZiaqjLy", "voter": "0x25431341A5800759268a6aC1d3CD91C029D7d9CA", "created": 1627895281, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPysmQCvz9es4QdKheuRBeibTARMqHwuvdhxdGuawRsZ3", "voter": "0xC9f9f6cfD655417AcB8D1bB00Fe77aD9a6d9cA81", "created": 1627890892, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUrWYxiRmHK9N41YUhsrEyRgyj8nGJDqGqgyy9Dt3nKdq", "voter": "0x243706e13823949dca2283Ce5607F618d9D17c31", "created": 1627873649, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQtYSCVegyRYpXBY1QGLBpaCGWwyDiVTnHSpKgryt1zzz", "voter": "0xfA9dBab87Da24FA3716c084CC8F9cc4F5E573849", "created": 1627830690, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZuoD5zGWLifhNv38GSY5vfxJJPE7Hpn1qcqMJ69uZ1iJ", "voter": "0x76Da9F88e63a85Ba8BFA19F3821D5A271753D3dc", "created": 1627830456, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sharedstake.eth"}}]}
