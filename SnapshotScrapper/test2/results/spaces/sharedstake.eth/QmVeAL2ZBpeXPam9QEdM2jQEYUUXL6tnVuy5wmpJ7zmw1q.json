A community could be bootstrapped out of the ashes of this disaster. The team is building in the background -- I have heard whispers in the dark. A commitment deliver perhaps 10% of Geode tokens to the true SGT stans, single-stakers and LP'rs alike, would be an amazing gesture.  I know we've all been burned, but the cool touch of Ice Bear dropping some new awesome project on us could be just what we need. Who' s with me?", "choices": ["Yes!
