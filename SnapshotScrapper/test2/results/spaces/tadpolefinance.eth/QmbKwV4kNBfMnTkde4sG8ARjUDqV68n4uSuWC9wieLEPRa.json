{"id": "QmbKwV4kNBfMnTkde4sG8ARjUDqV68n4uSuWC9wieLEPRa", "title": "[Proposal] Migrate TAD and Tadpole Finance Platform to Another Blockchain Network", "body": "We started Tadpole Finance to build a transformational blockchain-powered lending ecosystem. In the beginning, we created the platform on top of Ethereum to sail this ship. However, as we started developing with our product line, we experienced a lag in terms of transactions in the Ethereum network. \n\nThe Ethereum blockchain went very slow in terms of transaction confirmations and beyond acceptable/manageable transaction fees. Tadpole Finance is committed to building a smooth lending experience, and these hindrances from Ethereum were turning our use-cases obsolete. \n\nTherefore, as a public blockchain project, we want to ask our community and supporters whether we agree to migrate to other blockchain technologies such as Binance Smart Chain and Tron, which many projects have trusted as Ethereum alternative. We can also choose to stay in Ethereum while waiting for its network to be more stable in the future.\n\nAs a form of openness and transparency of the decision, voting weight is determined by the ownership of the TAD token in the voter's ethereum address when the snapshot was taken. The bigger the TAD token you have, the greater the decision power you can use for a proposal to determine the development direction of the Tadpole Finance project.\n\nShould we move TAD and Tadpole Finance platform to another blockchain network?", "choices": ["Stay in the Ethereum Network", "Migrate to Binance Smart Chain", "Migrate to Tron", "Migrate to other networks "], "start": 1614877200, "end": 1616086800, "snapshot": "11974999", "state": "closed", "author": "0x58305C26337b7aD714E1DEb9bb4a94c288b77ec2", "space": {"id": "tadpolefinance.eth", "name": "Tadpole Finance"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXjFRDhZdduT2Nwq91djGoUy3S2Z2Rv7KsKA3afGKK1HD", "voter": "0x16DfCeabb08A4f0DEffc28B8d7beA29EE120cab7", "created": 1615278383, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tadpolefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbe7iDrQW7YuwX4mu6Fny4HmRgSc4E6aoyp5DuCXzgyPs", "voter": "0x3Bd8a7805E4bA4C7e413E8a814fFa9B6B74b5cAF", "created": 1615024281, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tadpolefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcwrbdgwMdTuHwRptN6XQnnjv7ShaneaWWkcEq5UNeioK", "voter": "0x26E2c25eCD2c47caE189Dd38Bf97e52EeCF58b71", "created": 1614990602, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tadpolefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeKjCY2f3FbYzPUEv9sJuno5LJ3JJLGzix692dRi2ux8f", "voter": "0xbe33e01B2675f844450fEA3Bc7DCa32962E957E6", "created": 1614990197, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tadpolefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeTQmim9whXVfTzuaXmuctNJQsJp5vkNSGVj7PZye96MS", "voter": "0xE04E0Fec2D4b37bF5860ACbEbA99B72FC2975a04", "created": 1614952227, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tadpolefinance.eth"}}]}
