Tadpole Finance project was initiated to run on the Ethereum network, but with the gas constraints, this project was forced to migrate to Binance Smart Chain to cut the transaction costs so that the Tadpole Finance users could enjoy this decentralized application cheaper and more quickly.\n\nThis migration process was not easy. We tried to find existing options for bridging ERC20 to BEP20, we found 1 promising project, but the project turned out to be very buggy. We also found that other options are either not open for listing or requires a big check for a listing, which is not suitable for small projects.\n\nBecause of this experience, after Tadpole Finance Bridge development is done, we think that we might open this bridge feature universally. In this sense, all ERC20 projects can be added to this universal bridge (by paying a small fee). This way, all projects with a similar problem can easily find a solution to migrate their tokens to the Binance Smart Chain network (BEP20). We have completed the bridge for TAD, so opening the bridge to be universal is not too difficult. We can improve the existing source code to support all ERC20 tokens instead of just TAD token. On the other hand, Tadpole Finance can collect a small payment from the service. This will benefit all TAD Token holders.\n\nWe believe Universal ERC20 BEP20 Bridge can help the Decentralized Applications ecosystem and also be a profitable option for TAD holders.\n\nDo you agree Tadpole Finance to implement Universal ERC20-BEP20 Bridge feature? If yes, how should we structure the listing fee?", "choices": ["No, keep the bridge only for TAD", "Yes, and the listing is free", "Yes, and charge some TAD", "Yes, and charge some ETH/BNB"], "start": 1629392400, "end": 1630429140, "snapshot": "13060480", "state": "closed", "author": "0x58305C26337b7aD714E1DEb9bb4a94c288b77ec2", "space": {"id": "tadpolefinance.eth", "name": "Tadpole Finance"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNtotUhfw5dPviVx2fjTtjoZVWyb13WJNKuz1XXzP4bJ2", "voter": "0xD39C74c6a8C2B759a6b855804964a24cAB2Fa79b", "created": 1629687232, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "tadpolefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU5hmugqX5C2T4Hf9ZjsyykEM2QdmEQUCh5JsMkB82qhh", "voter": "0x2D782AC9C130da5746a7EABc8bf0c3Dcd40D262a", "created": 1629467111, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "tadpolefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXveiPs2w3bb4jEmh39EKGdnzk6v88d2XpVTBdTjriXR1", "voter": "0xEB50F847D430A0B26Be4EF66cf517b92631C8736", "created": 1629448374, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "tadpolefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPV8YxB2Xotd6vYF6crp85MUhQPxsowBSPBh8kFAmQS4M", "voter": "0xD1d62b01017b4687ad63d87AD199c97740c28e2f", "created": 1629441707, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "tadpolefinance.eth"}}]}
