{"id": "QmWywrdQ3GcMRTLpvHknhrvJLMBqx8LZcQsh6Lgrdn1WMF", "title": "Buying Farm NFT's without Farming", "body": "While the Unifty.io devs are still working on the migratable points for our new farms, they have gifted us a valuable \"Wild Card NFT\" to cover any and all platform costs on the BSC Network! This saves us BNB when creating all the farms for the content creators as well as adding the shop feature to our farms.\n\nThe Shop feature adds the ability to sell the NFT's in the farm without farming. Nothing changes for those currently earning points and the claim feature will still be available as is. The compromise for those that are Farming, will be a 3 day period between listing and the instant buy feature. This way the LOF Holders that are Farming have a 3 day lead on anybody who wants the golds, meaning the instant buy will most likely only be for the Silver and Bronze. \n\nAdding the instant buy feature on day 3 will make it easier for the content creators to involve their fans, with less technical knowledge, unless they want to watch the /farmvid and get involved in farming those beautiful golds!\n\nThe question we have for you, the holders of LOF, is how much more should NON Farmers pay over those that Farm? Also, since this is a change to the original plan, we want to leave the option for this motion to be rejected.
