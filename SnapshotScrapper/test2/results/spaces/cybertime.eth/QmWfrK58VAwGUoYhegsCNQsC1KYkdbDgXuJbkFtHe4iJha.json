TVL of 3 pools surpassed $ 200,000 after three days of farming. We are confident that the potential for farming is much higher. In addition, many users were surprised by the token distribution system. Everything was directed to farming\n38% of tokens. They are distributed as follows:\n\nBUSD - 78.95%\nCTF - 13.16%\nDAOS - 7.89%\n\nThe bet was made on the BUSD pool, but after the launch, stop factors for increasing TVL in the pool became obvious:\n\nHigh commission on deposit\nLow liquidity SAVENFT\nWe decided to offer the community a more honest distribution of tokens + options for solving the liquidity problem.\n\nWe offer the following scheme:\n\nDAOS - 54%\nSAVENFT / BNB - 20%\nCTF - 20%\nSAVENFT - 5%\nBUSD - 1%\n\nWe will focus on supporting our tokens + add a pool with LP SAVENFT / BNB + a separate SAVENFT pool.\n\nAn important point! We have agreed with ApeSwap to place the DAOS / BNB liquidity pool in the farm section. As soon as we overcome the $ 100k in pool bar, we will appear in the section within 24 hours. So the pool liquidity can grow up to $300-400k.\n\nSince the BUSD pool lost 77%, and people paid the entry fee and most likely want to leave the pool for others, within 14 days we will reimburse everyone who made a deposit to BUSD the commission + the cost of early withdrawal from the SAVENFT pool.
