Buy Jesus Coin.", "body": "According to Pew Research, irreligion is on the rise across America. 22.8% of Americans no longer profess adherence to any major religion. As a result, Jesus Coin has seen a precipitous decline in market capitalization and trading activity since its ICO was first covered by Investopedia back in 2018. \n\nWhat was once predicted to reach upwards of a $50MM market cap has instead been delisted from CoinMarketCap. Its website, jesuscoin.network, redirects to a Chinese gambling site. Trading volumes are at $0 across all known exchanges. The outlook for a decentralized prayer and sin forgiveness network looks bleak. Or does it? \n\n**The Good News**\n\nWhile I may have painted a grim picture at the beginning of my proposal, there is a tremendous market opportunity for Jesus Coin to succeed in the short-, medium-, and long-term. \n\nIn 2017 a study confirmed that Christianity will remain the world\u2019s largest religion, reaching more than 3.05 billion (or 31.8%) of the world\u2019s population by 2060. Simply put, Christian fertility is very bullish. They have a fertility rate of 2.7 children per woman, which is higher than the global average of 2.5, and significantly higher than the birthrate in some Western countries of on average 1.6. \n\nWith adequate exposure $JC could become an integral part of generational wealth creation in developing nations, while providing an accessible, low-friction means of atoning for one\u2019s sin.  \n\nFinally, with an implied market cap of $0 this could have the biggest upside potential of any alt coin out there. \n\n**The $JC Resurrection Plan**\n\n1. We will relaunch the Jesus coin website. \n2. Relist $JC on Coingecko and CoinMarketCap.\n3. Begin accumulation of $JC\n4. Massive $JC airdrop campaign targeting spiritual KOLs\n5. As the price rises, fedora-wearing atheists on popular websites like Reddit will become enraged and begin to generate free exposure to our investment scheme.\n6. We use the $GME staking program to incentivize a major liquidity mining event that will let us offload our bags at profit.\n\nThe Lord works in mysterious ways and what would be more mysterious than pumping Jesus Coin ($JC)? Please vote for my proposal.\n", "choices": ["Pump $JC", "Do not pump $JC"], "start": 1612404000, "end": 1613008800, "snapshot": "11787932", "state": "closed", "author": "0xf1ec787bAF33c96251E7cfA4f13Af449d9B489E0", "space": {"id": "gamestopfinance.eth", "name": "gamestop.finance"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNd95AxXwyMyY24LtDeijSLXGW3AbP2n1jgDXTLnd3vov", "voter": "0x118eE2516EAA449ce7d9CA3ceFeEC01FD85ADaE2", "created": 1612902594, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "gamestopfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYgehm5gLVg7Nm8FWd1F5UduYZspUG2CxXwJH1o4quCB4", "voter": "0x9344d150e92B7C63ed8DA289161b6bEc4D787272", "created": 1612659452, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "gamestopfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRn1tLDRtHgypV2WSuBZe3pFU2tPXPt1nTsvY1hKKcKxP", "voter": "0x9FC5BEa9000986a756C61E00E34d50c3f0A3283D", "created": 1612619495, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "gamestopfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfRDDHPUeA1ZgpKeZW3ALa1R2hqhtc84S78yAo4xWfNV6", "voter": "0xD8595ac2836B7a8040f046E751B42088436B6365", "created": 1612515775, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "gamestopfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ5DTttwGGoP8sUU3FdiC6EFj7Ju6Jp55LfLTCyoEHxDS", "voter": "0x048414640547AF3d91b9CB8B207c7f2663005Dd6", "created": 1612476638, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "gamestopfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma92JKEqJCpHKksyPnPFkUjjy2RJfms6rJayCa62drKqL", "voter": "0x72B92dce4c6276A1FF2f7278F1FE96e9F2BfC564", "created": 1612426612, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "gamestopfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmagp4TQxBFVm65CNK9cfhzMoNYHayqUe1MrXtcKpQ2U8p", "voter": "0x60e6e08C7BE717ABA87576CfDcDceA5e7B13a046", "created": 1612422662, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "gamestopfinance.eth"}}]}
