{"id": "QmS52EFRbJ3jdr91izUQrjC7aHFyURkXxTNuEiK8Atjfrd", "title": "Should we open a community donation treasury of $LULZ to incentivize adoption?", "body": "On July 27, 2021, LULZ was provided as a fully decentralized token by Twitter user https://twitter.com/sell9000. The fully supply of 10,000 LULZ was distributed to the community with $10,000 in liquidity locked for 5 years by sell9000, with all fees fronted. While there is significant value in a fully circulating token that was not pre-sold or has impending unlocks from VC funds, the drawback is there are no incentive pools or treasuries to drive adoption or marketing. \n\nTherefore, we must rely on the generosity of the community to achieve these objectives, if willing. This first proposal is to assess whether the community is inclined to create a special pool or fund to drive adoption. By voting for any of the \"yes\" options, you will signal your informal pledge donating a portion of your LULZ tokens to the lulzfail.eth address (0x000007Ee8698947DE73eb94CD4E89086fe481146) as a treasury in a non-binding manner.\n\nFurthermore, sell900 has little incentive to spearhead or lead adoption without stake in the game as his donation to the community did not include a stake for himself, so it is primarily up to the community to discover a utility for this token. An option to provide sell9000 a small fraction of the pledged amount may help provide a de facto unofficial community leader with incentive in the interim until utility is discovered and established.\n\nDepending on the donations received, a further spending proposal will be drafted. Some of these spends may include paying tokens for influencer marketing, airdropping for community expansion, incentivizing partnerships, promoting liquidity mining, paying developers and community managers, etc. The options to vote are:\n\n1. Yes, I'll pledge some LULZ to the treasury for community use  (separate vote for distribution % afterwards)\n2. Yes, I'll pledge some LULZ to the treasury for community use plus a small fraction to sell9000 for the lulz (separate vote for distribution % afterwards)\n3.
