This allocation can be revoked if the other opportunities are more attractive or if the incentivization from third-party ends earlier or if Balancer chooses to end their rewards for this pool.\n\nThis pool has been shown to attract and bind circulating MTA on Polygon. Currently, there are no other places on Polygon that offers a use case and yield for MTA. It holds currently around $2.4 Million in value with 1.7 Million in MTA. In case incentivisation stops, funds are likely to be withdrawn or sold. This pool helps to support the mStable's Polygon implementation and allows users to provide liquidity with MTA and offers efficient swaps.\n\nBalancer has been supporting this Pool since its launch with additional BAL rewards. The amount was set to 1000 BAL per week. This amount is likely to be adjusted downwards to match the amount of MTA provided.\n\n**Should we further allocate 15,000 MTA per week to this pool?**", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1633410000, "end": 1633669200, "snapshot": "13357589", "state": "closed", "author": "0xE76Be9C1e10910d6Bc6b63D8031729747910c2f6", "space": {"id": "mstableprotocoldao.eth", "name": "mStable Protocol DAO"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmReTWuVtXU3vPgjDm4KEGxQ9wzKATiysYTz9zkZgqQ4rY", "voter": "0xD8baE7d96df905E46718B6ceE3410F535e11bF20", "created": 1633432917, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstableprotocoldao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUG9vmToGYKwWeEXcb1MxgQpkmexBGFiZuaaiq9wcgx7K", "voter": "0x9e0CD3aC304a458F9c7B3D45172CdB62700f595B", "created": 1633430160, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstableprotocoldao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXMBFvYub5FkMVDmEkmCroLxF9SnrdKrvENuzZ7xH6Jy6", "voter": "0x0945b923d4922Bf30528931Ed92f1c20CEac9541", "created": 1633430140, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstableprotocoldao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPBmHg1u9BhMQjc4j4WurQxr16gz4guk5eBuBeRnbEEmH", "voter": "0x2f2Db75C5276481E2B018Ac03e968af7763Ed118", "created": 1633427961, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstableprotocoldao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW6XrninapqgiiLVQisco47RCBF9XCxZDRfpPi5d87LeN", "voter": "0xC5ee70CDBa695F864FA07A378aF6711f45D1339A", "created": 1633427730, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstableprotocoldao.eth"}}]}
