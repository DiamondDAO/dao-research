MAI can also be swapped for USDC, which is then deposited into the treasury to back the value of MAI itself.\n\nA MAI/mUSD Feeder Pool on Polygon would offer a more capital efficient swap on Polygon compared to current swap protocols. Additionally, co-incentivization of the Feeder Pool would offer an attractive yield, and bootstrap more users to mStable on Polygon.\n\n**Should we move forward and create a proposal as PDP-27?**", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1625576400, "end": 1625835600, "snapshot": "12773981", "state": "closed", "author": "0xE76Be9C1e10910d6Bc6b63D8031729747910c2f6", "space": {"id": "mstableprotocoldao.eth", "name": "mStable Protocol DAO"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmeTPz5f7ZmXBSti4yim1Yom1LGvFKNnV7rSvBT6NceY9a", "voter": "0x0945b923d4922Bf30528931Ed92f1c20CEac9541", "created": 1625658039, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mstableprotocoldao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXAFtMDRv2V14ZhCns6Cy82ZqC75Lg1X3nxazXeSLzw5A", "voter": "0xD8baE7d96df905E46718B6ceE3410F535e11bF20", "created": 1625631157, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstableprotocoldao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdCQQhnmHVpTNTcaEcce9y5kQCnCN6xoMjYVB7DQtUMZG", "voter": "0xC5ee70CDBa695F864FA07A378aF6711f45D1339A", "created": 1625585008, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstableprotocoldao.eth"}}]}
