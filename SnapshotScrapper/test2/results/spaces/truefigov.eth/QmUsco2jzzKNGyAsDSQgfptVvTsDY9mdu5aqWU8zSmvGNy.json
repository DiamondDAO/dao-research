It does not take into account the term period of the loan. Borrowers are paying the same fees irrespective of term of the loan.\n\nMotivation:\nThe current fee structure is disincentivizing short term loans and is not very nuanced.\n\nSpecification:\nThis proposal (if passed) will add a flat fee of $500 and a variable component to the loan origination fee.\n\n\nVoting Options:\nYes, and set variable rate to 0.125% for 30 days (1.5% annualised)\nYes, and set variable rate to 0.01% for 30 days (1.2% annualised)\nYes, and set variable rate to 0.25% for 30 days (3% annualised)\n\n", "choices": ["YES, 1.5% Annualised Fee", "YES, 1.2% Annualised Fee", "YES, 3% Annualised Fee", "NO, discuss further in forums"], "start": 1610812800, "end": 1611158400, "snapshot": "11664969", "state": "closed", "author": "0x8Fac841807E21807F511dAf3C04a34cd78661F4c", "space": {"id": "truefigov.eth", "name": "TrueFi"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVwMgjSZ7BANyYshQL4vcH3Rn2CpxAqb7cv5M39RNAnzi", "voter": "0x7De370fADcF43D12E3a7a463056606A96dB3248A", "created": 1611099547, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "truefigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQQznDMB5eQmsqPpBG1aNPDmWTmoQbBZZpi1wHDNqGspd", "voter": "0xf91d8Ef97D5c7c08d7453D1852168fc36aa95dA4", "created": 1611094274, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "truefigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP4jm5fEEVmmtogkRiJUZK7Ybun5JknRBYsuJ4UrC2EiE", "voter": "0x6f3F56f613B9960b8B7BA88b64F35337c7D27039", "created": 1611093950, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "truefigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV28NjdNP4FDQkn89iK1MgyNN64rAxXLBNgPp8WXQKKQD", "voter": "0x005FA2741421824CdC8aCEB39687D80746aD647F", "created": 1611083602, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "truefigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUSrKNgxFGcJhari4z58FrTtzMTdPnXQWgdzExtK6bBev", "voter": "0x0656d8b7b1Fcc09788F4A7B657B38A3A4EeB3f9B", "created": 1611031646, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "truefigov.eth"}}]}
