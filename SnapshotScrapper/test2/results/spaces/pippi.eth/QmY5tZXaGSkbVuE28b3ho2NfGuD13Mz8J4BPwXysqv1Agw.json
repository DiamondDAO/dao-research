Among the current 78M, 20M is the treasury locked part and 58M is the market circulation part. PIPPI team will maintain the total amount other than the burned addresses by regularly burning the reduced production of PIPI and repurchasing PIPI, so as to ensure the total market value remaining within the 100 million cap.\n\nDue to users\u2019 misunderstanding and dissatisfaction, three solutions are proposed for community voting:\n\n1. The total amount of PIPI 100 million does not include the burning part, which means the relative hard cap of 100M release is 108M-30M (burning part)\n\n2. The total amount of PIPI 100 million includes the burning part, while the 20M reserved by the original fund will be burned and destroyed. The hard top with the burning part included will be changed to 120M, and then there will be 120M-108M = 12M coins left for users to mine. The economic model will be redesigned after the mining stopped.\n\n3.
