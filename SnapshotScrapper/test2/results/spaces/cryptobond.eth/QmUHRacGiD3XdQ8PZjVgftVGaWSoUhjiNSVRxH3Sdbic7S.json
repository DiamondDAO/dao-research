We are looking to partner with every project that will help us secure better liquidity for our protocol. We currently have several LPs that we would like to get whitelisted. Our main liquidity pools, which we would like to get whitelisted first, are listed below:\n\n\n- $TRDL/ETH SLP: https://app.sushi.com/pair/0x05Cc2e064e0B48e46015EAd9961F1391d74E5F83\n\n- vBTC/ETH UniV2:\nhttps://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xcFDCD696dde5df39f569807C6934E6bA97ceBb8A\n\nIf sync whitelists these LPs, I will compromise to find further incentives for the creation of the bonds, such as NFT staking rewarded by $TRDL. \n\nLearn more about Strudel here: https://t.me/StrudelFinanceOfficial", "choices": ["Whitelist Strudel LPs", "Deny"], "start": 1615222800, "end": 1615482000, "snapshot": "11999050", "state": "closed", "author": "0x69eF61AFc3AA356e1ac97347119d75cBdAbEF534", "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth", "name": "SYNC Network"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSKfaV3PteUiyMnKK3wD77GR9s43BCWrv2Ht77EcfFX9W", "voter": "0xBD1f7d88C76A86C60d41bDDD4819fAe404e7151E", "created": 1615349750, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme12Yef2eByZfsHtA5ZBcQ3iG7Hs5MBRRAaaLdgGoEqdG", "voter": "0x3Af1E63c693b7A3545CA3365207691ad368316C7", "created": 1615234524, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}]}
