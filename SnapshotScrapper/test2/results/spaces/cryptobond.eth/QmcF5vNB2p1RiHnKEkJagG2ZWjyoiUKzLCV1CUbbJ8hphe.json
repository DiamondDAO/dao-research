{"id": "QmcF5vNB2p1RiHnKEkJagG2ZWjyoiUKzLCV1CUbbJ8hphe", "title": "Commissioned or artist generated bond artwork", "body": "Right now artists are getting paid for NFT artwork. In some instances artists can get paid initially for their NFT art and get paid a portion of subsequent reselling of their NFT art. Now imagine if an artist was able to create syncbond NFT art to attach to a single bond or series of bonds. The payouts of those bonds would pay a percentage (or flat rate of sync) to the art creator either periodically or upon complete maturity. Essentially, the artist and holder could profit from the price of the sync payout or the value of the NFT art (or both). Once the bond matures, the art is either lost forever or the holder of the bond can rebond to \"save\" the art and reap all the forward benefit, or should she choose, cut back in the artist for the new bond.  \n\nI envision that an artist could create the artwork for the bond and hold the bond herself or the artist could \"commission\" artwork that could be chosen by a bond creator to include as the art in the bonding process.  There could be a pool of art on the bonding page with the artist's \"percentage\" or a flat rate (i.e. 200 sync), or a percentage with a minimum \"bond price\" she would charge for allowing the art to be put into an NFT syncbond.  The art could be a one off, a limited print (i.e. usable in a limited number of bonds, similar to limited prints) or a series of artworks.  Drawing even a few well known artists for commissioned bond art could be a huge deal for the NFT aspect of Sync.  ", "choices": ["Do it. What are we waiting for.", "Waste of time.
