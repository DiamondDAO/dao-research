{"id": "QmTstiCgnzK197ntWjx1tvQnvHDx3yuwVseoQ5X92meVWV", "title": "Develop SYNC Network on Binance Smart Chain", "body": "Currently there are undeniable frictions to the Ethereum ecosystem in that gas fees are far far too high for the average user. We already recognize this in the gas station product where we subsidize the cost of the Ethereum network.\n\nThis is however unsustainable and presents some challenges:\n1. the unnecessary drain of treasury funds\n2. time consumption from one of the devs/volunteers to vet valid refunds\n3. confusion from the end user and a leap faith required (i.e. will I actually get this refund???)\n\nTo solve this we must move to where this is no longer a problem. As many other Ethereum projects have done we must move to a side chain. At least for the mean time whilst the gas issues are solved.\n\nI propose that we begin at the earliest opportunity either:\n\n1. Development of a fork of the Sync Network and token for the Binance Smart Chain with airdrops of the new token to all current Sync and Sync Bond holders\n\nor\n\n2. Development of functionality on BSC with the SYNC token migrated over.\n", "choices": ["Develop BSC fork of Sync", "Development of BSC functionality"], "start": 1617760800, "end": 1618365600, "snapshot": "12191503", "state": "closed", "author": "0xF72CD97a579fB4B06588812ad3bF3F9C739F02A3", "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth", "name": "SYNC Network"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUr88HYtnaqLabMEr726pX2mbUWHGkC44mvqDTGJ1Jxw7", "voter": "0xcB4Bdc593f4176Ab98265E22aB0CBe2673f5ad4c", "created": 1617975767, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPJ2K7WQGc5CrZEVK5ts5xinjJTHmUuGrbiwhMpxxQrbg", "voter": "0xFDE7019cf4c8F17d6B658224faF89C71456be39A", "created": 1617920719, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUThLK7QSRjWdc3bZW56jVkQ1Npw45ufooCaqsZytTvku", "voter": "0x74c224150d67875DFa1E9A484ADd621910Bb0c5B", "created": 1617886263, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWZAMaa6Fpxp1UkPeVuxy9K6wvVmeKrKwqJqvxueSXiqp", "voter": "0x54DB2938A37EAb1a1E474069f3AF6dC78498a7d6", "created": 1617875387, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeVNHSeWWXGc9wS5jgiCk82MpJxTzJLEGM1JgEyPsgFeC", "voter": "0x60fF54a44835fcC96121Cb250E76bCA420489Fc0", "created": 1617819321, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}]}
