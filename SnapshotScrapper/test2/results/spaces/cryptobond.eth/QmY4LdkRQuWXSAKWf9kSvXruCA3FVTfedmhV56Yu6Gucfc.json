SYNC ? I remember this....\"\n\nIs that possible? Is there even such a being? \nWho are we gonna call?? \nNo No.. its not Ghostbusters!\nIts Ivan alright but a different  kind of bread, its  SHELDON IVAN!!\n\nSheldon Ivans YouTube channel has 338k subs he reaches not only crypto crowds but also general internet money investors and wanna get rich crowd craving for multipliers!\nHe truly looks like a saint and very honest guy, very skilled in wording and explaining projects and feels very authentic and trustworthy.\nHe has years of marketing, managing business, doing courses, and Youtube with also two other channels.\n\nHe's a real magnet and force to recon.\nFor those that followed AXION in the initial take off, i'm sure you know who he is.\nI refer to him as \"The AXION Messiah investor who voluntarily and solo handed took matters into his own hands and lifted AXION far above the marketing mud they had got themselves in\"\n\nWe don't just want a one time talk paid promotion from youtubers!\nNo, no, no, no..!\n-We want him to hear and see a quality bullet proof appealing presentation of SYNC with all big brains future ideas of potentials included!\n-We want him to take that, make it his own and wrap it in golden angelical musical peace and sing it to the world!\n-We want him to feel grateful for the golden opportunity that's presented!\n-We want him waking up sweaty, out of control, in the middle of the night with the almighty \"synk!\" \"Synk!\" \"SYNK!\" echoing in his mind!\n-We want him to walk by everyone's screen and whisper SYNC in every ear and hold our hand when in need!\n\nSo make no mistake my SYNC friends, doubt and uncertainty will hastily go away giving room to fear and greed ,\nthe circle you want will be completed as alongside him there will be forced to lay a pair of big boys pants and in front of him a bowl of small cap gems.\nLarking in the backgrounds other voices will surge forced by the emerging murmurs and gossip, and guided buy our now new ally friends; doubt, uncertainty, fear and greed.\n\nThat's why i submit for voting  this  proposal for team to concentrate efforts and  budget on promoting SYNC through Sheldon Evans Youtube Channel!\nIf you are a believer in SYNC like me and want to gain control and make this project be known and succeed \nVote YES to this proposal  !\n\nThis small big step could ignite the start of times of abundance and expansion that will be upon us for many bond maturations to come!", "choices": ["YES", "NO"], "start": 1611662400, "end": 1612872000, "snapshot": "11727615", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5aaF51511E17Ef2007aA4c3761ac1362f3E3b525", "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth", "name": "SYNC Network"}, "votes": 14, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qma6qiH5XHDiNgPGcVwhEMHybSx2cdXZjn9oZv8gyPhzLg", "voter": "0x60fF54a44835fcC96121Cb250E76bCA420489Fc0", "created": 1612846181, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPFkeANLW1ycF8RbT5jC4NSP1y2NKbRB4Bg3aLAzryDY9", "voter": "0x9720BC8a430930c17AaBf574E9aD546a13862Eb7", "created": 1612773788, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWERTMqHbi9iYcnkGCxc4U6awWKUA5ntpyCCPHxhmrQqd", "voter": "0x2AaE5E79c5A4048Cd6f3C1D161414074af98096E", "created": 1612348061, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVvAjs74qRoH75DCv7ZWawDdXyGTiJkY9UUF6Dwj9tGxV", "voter": "0xB15ED294Ba7105207eC0c8560Ee20e0b8F9CCD15", "created": 1612315540, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWBJfxEbVgU2TBHBKz64RBG3zdJEMewjtSgLZLHhnnzft", "voter": "0xC7e54131ceCB6faa664Bfd49C1e03C8E4d81B342", "created": 1612311001, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdcPU5KYQYWbMeNteMYHK5PR8x6de7HBXjrppLY9gqXr1", "voter": "0x7180e344f5596171b1A0f0bFfD42e389300A4822", "created": 1612296607, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTmbJv4GEySQbbAGM9rDuPoL8wpCNeeDAMnw1LErQAvqw", "voter": "0x1F2196A055dAe1eEF6f7cC5E8dE1e4b7FD9B7Be0", "created": 1612293803, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPcHa3LiLsGiEK5hq2RJATcfoB4iMRKzDqpeeAAEw4xcT", "voter": "0xCe2226685BD6D3b5F296e06ab3Eac73d204aC86e", "created": 1612293189, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQC2Vgtb1h2s8NhKkCEvc6eWoFFM3oFP5yMa4SXLCR5gi", "voter": "0x1c89aE758A6310a465B406bf0fd10FDB5eE43d5E", "created": 1612231752, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeT19ZwEwbcqY4ooqHQefEB1gWrcp3sLX9ud3SLidiNed", "voter": "0x165d932a820CB5Ec686191695FaA81b80C9eF97C", "created": 1612003430, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPnsoMBnhXzZoP8jNJ2NG85fYNCKEHAyHx81XgwMWUfTs", "voter": "0x3a688bA3E546A8FDbBaCfDFa853315143b8B76Ca", "created": 1611808366, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYeyh5Uhb1e6Wj1J8v3nqzSAqarAdQRaPb9VB8CSpth4T", "voter": "0xE0f94903b58DFB0aFB14109FAc17E2c41eD78f47", "created": 1611802502, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPZxKhktZs44vsrjgUYV76AAju5nJQDfpyJtSqZrMQjBB", "voter": "0x8Da4F82Dc4D03c5421BB2087F858750c650d8571", "created": 1611762102, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWVVWVivY6sLTNfkoKB9sJaJrDJ5C1ph1BUejKAtsFvbw", "voter": "0x5aaF51511E17Ef2007aA4c3761ac1362f3E3b525", "created": 1611715361, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}]}
