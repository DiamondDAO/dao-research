In addition to a good idea, we have to make our work known to attract more investment and with that investment reinvest to enhance the business. Only by capturing people's attention can we capture more investment and thus make the SYNC project grow. \n\nAlthough the project is excellent, our communication is practically nonexistent. Our social networks don't exist, we don't have an appealing institutional video that demonstrates what the project is, we don't create content so that there is engagement, we lack a video that explains more clearly how to create a CryptoBond, etc...\n\nIf we are creating a project with quality, we cannot only pay attention to the technical development part, but we must also be focused on our communication. It is in the investment between communication and technical development that we can grow our market cap and thus the value of SYNC. \n\nMy proposal is that we take a professional approach to our marketing and communication. To that end I leave two options for you to vote on. \n\n1 \ud83d\udd25 - External Solution: Hire a marketing and communication agency;\n\n2 \ud83d\udd25 - Internal Solution: Create a marketing department with specialized technicians exclusively dedicated to this area. This department must have its own budget to develop its activity;\n\nRegardless of the option the selected one should have a deep knowledge of the crypto market, namely in DeFi and NFT.\n\nThere are arguments for and against both options. I would like you to think about which option will contribute more importantly to our growth.\n\nThanks,\nHelder Pereira", "choices": ["External Solution", "Internal Solution", "Other Option"], "start": 1630944000, "end": 1632999600, "snapshot": "13172806", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2655eF469966D36d6320DCB4fF35C55785DE6024", "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth", "name": "SYNC Network"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmS2cmNokMDXtncHM37k4hMTNCBa6MAorNAyLGnfJMaW6m", "voter": "0xC1b762262aC8556370932DFEC2a6c18DfF5c7B9d", "created": 1632941185, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNiKBSSaai4ors7BrzAyEnZqB93dRAb91BGwqZyHAEsqQ", "voter": "0xD34A7095B8aAd4A4A125a2bFaB003A030f319Fc3", "created": 1632818000, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTSe859prWaiu4c3Bt21fJEYxbRARnXq53Zv32bKdVq6T", "voter": "0x334B4d9dc8C319adaC2d5a8eB85d021601AF38a5", "created": 1632527264, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTk9LbHZcESbfri8gYABc8TdpJrVVNWEmJV3kuhYA3pVx", "voter": "0xEd4246F18f8694E87e9863C17dbEc77d2224E21a", "created": 1630963283, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYPAtaHBi6GCWF4m8SgUvAPqEdhetskeCGY4sWd6Tw9YW", "voter": "0x6f9286C956677F7Ce6e18C96017C69d40daB6202", "created": 1630963261, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmStzAJxLFh6eQi9s1ZGfwVaCdjqXvUDM8FFxtyqFV8EXk", "voter": "0x89aA0c455e9052157A4D13a59eD7F081f2Da0FFf", "created": 1630959640, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY8x5HWexmkpeYZfHLuRWNxbhzKWmuNJEqyKBSvCaPxyC", "voter": "0x627C158C265e0F9e492978c5cc0C29aBA7E04B2D", "created": 1630952029, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ618t47BQQCd7Gz9Stofygq7Sv9vxfvddX3YTusgCUHs", "voter": "0xAE514EA64196f5517b16a131efA63B6C92f4Cafa", "created": 1630946515, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd4Sm5P3WXyjiWafDxMrW1HHaWFB8y6Bt8etEcjUb3tPR", "voter": "0xE25e044D1B59caF7C4Bd7f7E2D7065D20292AA77", "created": 1630946457, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSzARL1KHpbNoiEHMNS7hpTP9Cy3Sjh66vdiUV6MjQLTD", "voter": "0x2655eF469966D36d6320DCB4fF35C55785DE6024", "created": 1630946310, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf9wJRCTK8eqETj9p7wYoXrhR9PEECi7UrvDjNp9RzMSv", "voter": "0xB07107F606B1935346A607D2f7350f16b0a04Cad", "created": 1630945385, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}]}
