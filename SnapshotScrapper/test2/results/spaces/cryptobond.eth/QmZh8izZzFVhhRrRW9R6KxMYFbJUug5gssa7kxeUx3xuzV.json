Each synthetic asset (or Synth) is an ERC20 token which tracks the price of an external asset; for example, each sUSD token tracks the price of the US dollar (and unlike the other synthetic assets, is fixed at 1). A wide variety of Synths exists within Synthetix, including fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and inverse indexes. In principle, the system can support any asset with a clear price and provides on-chain exposure to an unlimited range of real-world assets. The protocol will enable a variety of trading features including binary options, futures, and more.\n\n", "choices": ["YES", "NO"], "start": 1611388800, "end": 1611475200, "snapshot": "11713697", "state": "closed", "author": "0xE25e044D1B59caF7C4Bd7f7E2D7065D20292AA77", "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth", "name": "SYNC Network"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVwUyW9TZ8fPmfxh7BUqyj44HVLrvFgaGViQiNPUQJQJ5", "voter": "0xf75967DF3d106cDdbEdC3E32d119141AD3680967", "created": 1611436025, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbTYHxEdAjJSxgQjUcAwa1NGvCFTMSfYeRpGaW64VbNur", "voter": "0x2837A728d3F73bb94bafb3b024FFE3A2834BF138", "created": 1611435968, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPWP1ux5ReGvn2ufVaa5oVsmrmPdFcYXUenUciBJKPB3p", "voter": "0xE25e044D1B59caF7C4Bd7f7E2D7065D20292AA77", "created": 1611430079, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cryptobond.eth"}}]}
