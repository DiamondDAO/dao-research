Why don't we do something to reward those that take the time to participate in governance and make this project \"defi.\" I'm not talking about airdrops (although I'm not opposed, I won't put it up for a vote) but a little something that incentivizes governance.  I suggest some cool artwork or variations that can only be unlocked during bond creation for those addresses that have participated in governance in the past 60 days (we can call them the \"governance bonds\" or \"governance variations\").  Even a small incentive might create the impetus for people to engage  by voting or proposing.  If you like the idea vote yes. If you don't, tell me to jam it. If you have a better idea, propose it.
