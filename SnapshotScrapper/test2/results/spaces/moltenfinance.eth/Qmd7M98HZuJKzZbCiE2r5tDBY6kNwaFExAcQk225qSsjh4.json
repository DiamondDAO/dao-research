This forsakes both early LAVA and MOL supporters. The LAVA staking UNI-V2 reward pool is mostly depleted. This is the perfect opportunity to let investors unstake their LAVA and participate in the LAVARY. LAVA rewards from the MOL stakers can be used as well. So I propose that you should be able to send LAVA from your wallet to the LAVARY address that has been purchased anytime ago. \nVote 'Lift restriction' to remove this restriction and LAVA bought anytime can be used for LAVARY. \nVote 'Keep restriction' to not chance anything.", "choices": ["Lift restriction", "Keep restriction"], "start": 1607770800, "end": 1608289200, "snapshot": "11437591", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3BcAf0e5Ce72D293509cb930214819Ef538B962e", "space": {"id": "moltenfinance.eth", "name": "MOLTEN"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTbUetMLjGL5a2BpESw8GHi9vLdZShD8xCCLnQg2uFKyV", "voter": "0x7B5A5335897B5c3FdAd92F3669065f337A434e36", "created": 1607956034, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moltenfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUWN5Z1nL1t4jbBHk4ZkQ2LP6hvu6rk751MACXeJSCj69", "voter": "0xD3B325b9c7aA33c8E19f33bBCD6B2FBE3Ac66fa7", "created": 1607772010, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "moltenfinance.eth"}}]}
