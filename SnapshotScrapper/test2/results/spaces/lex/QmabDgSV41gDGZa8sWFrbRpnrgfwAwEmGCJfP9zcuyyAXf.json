This `saleRate` is set to 1000 $LEX per ETH. (The [$LEX dApp](https://lexdao.github.io/LEX/) also provides a simple interface to accomplish a similar purchase for lump 100 $LEX upon signing a pop-up *BUY* button TX.) As there is a divergence in how $LEX is priced using this native function and market contracts like Uniswap, it seems helpful for now to use these nimbler markets to determine a dynamic rate and allow easy swap between $LEX and other tokens at such derived rate. In the event that this does not satisfy LexDAO objectives, such $LEX `saleRate` can be reinstated using $LEX governance functions. To effect a 'close and burn' change, the Moloch DAO with `manager` permissions over $LEX would process a vote ([`LexDAO Collective`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9b78A81836bda21CAaA368d935A09EFB1B86316c#code)) calling the `updateSale` function with the following data:\n\n`0x64629ff7000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007caee97613e670000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\n\n(This snapshot vote serves to signal on this contract update. $LEX can be staked into such COLLECTIVE DAO vote by calling the [`stokeTokenForShares()` function](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9b78A81836bda21CAaA368d935A09EFB1B86316c#writeContract).)\n\n**Background of $LEX faucets and Guild utility** \ud83d\udeb0\n\n[$LEX](https://lexdao.github.io/LEX/) can be claimed by using [LexDAO contracts](https://github.com/lexDAO/lexCorpus/) like [LexToken factory](https://lexdao.github.io/LexTokenize/) and [LexLocker](https://lexdao.github.io/LXL/), serves as [bounty currency](https://github.com/lexDAO/LexCorpus/issues) for upgrading LexDAO contracts / tip for participating in community activities, and further grants special [chat](https://discord.com/invite/M4jxXmk) / [pub.](https://outpost-protocol.com/lex) access as well as governance rights to cast [snap votes on LexDAO agenda](https://snapshot.page/#/lex) and manage certain LexDAO contracts on-chain. More simply, it looks like a `community token` paired to the soul of the LexDAO legal engineering guild. \n\n**Markets** \ud83e\uddee\n\nAlternatively, $LEX can be [purchased on the open market](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?exactField=input&exactAmount=0.01&inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x63125c0d5Cd9071de9A1ac84c400982f41C697AE) using decentralized exchanges like Uniswap to gain access more immediately, and further provides a way to exit into other digital tokens and native ETH to deploy contracts and manage DAO participation fees. As certain [$LEX-locked publications](https://outpost-protocol.com/lex) reference the $LEX Uniswap exchange, and there might be ongoing needs to reconcile this \"dynamic\" price with the price set in the $LEX contract native exchange for ETH, it seems worthwhile considering and voting and effecting a decision on whether to maintain both markets, or simply defer to DEX market mechanisms for $LEX grants.", "choices": ["YEA \ud83d\udc4d", "NAY \ud83d\udc4e"], "start": 1610816400, "end": 1611162000, "snapshot": "11668846", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1C0Aa8cCD568d90d61659F060D1bFb1e6f855A20", "space": {"id": "lex", "name": "LexDAO Collective"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmViaewUH6CiHrCARewJRDNCvUrBezNL1TwtohjEzWTF9h", "voter": "0xCbbd18d3aC27ab0FFfD04BCCd091B2802c92e0ca", "created": 1611102796, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "lex"}}, {"id": "QmNLyxnsbtP7hBUSp6zUc5qLP7Q4BQFjyF7NVTXzo4FvXA", "voter": "0xa3564677FC4907A15c9A7EAe1DBc1ae9aC57b8E1", "created": 1611102723, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "lex"}}, {"id": "QmSiHrzWKMjQ1UVEQ7VS3KJ5P1nfz53aAAf99ZZc5uvsvq", "voter": "0x7136fbDdD4DFfa2369A9283B6E90A040318011Ca", "created": 1611102661, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "lex"}}, {"id": "QmRCCekMN2bvczLB439RatJSC4Z3iWBbqWos21QxKwa5Sv", "voter": "0x90FF89C637Fd1537E151B8ced1d1D0Cb94e31cA6", "created": 1611042843, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "lex"}}, {"id": "QmeVfTeoXmmi67LwpW92mxj39vz2pX5p9C2WZHDYNG1MQv", "voter": "0xd5B3988eD0AB5ec375E51bB6fd10e205cEC16A2E", "created": 1610848120, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "lex"}}, {"id": "QmZuxkAgNQPrU8CNv1JwXjvLJBQYCk7KMYivQHoCMWekAf", "voter": "0x1C0Aa8cCD568d90d61659F060D1bFb1e6f855A20", "created": 1610835531, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "lex"}}]}
