The \u201cCore Contracts\u201d and \u201cUX\u201d squads will be led by DeFi Options core team members. The remaining squad lead roles will be open for applications and designated by ShineDAO to experienced contributors. Squads will run in 2-week sprints with the following general roles and responsibilities in each squad.\n\n### Incubation Committee\nIncubation Committee contains one representative from DeFi Options DAO and one representative from ShineDAO (Elected by ShineDAO Committee). The incubation committee is responsible for defining the sprint goals, fostering alignment between squads, and updating the community on overall progress on weekly basis. Based on the sprint goals, expected generated value and no. of contributors required, the incubation committee will allocate rewards for each squad and its lead.\n\n### Squad Leads\nEach squad has a leader responsible for shaping and agreeing on deliverables with their contributors based on goals from the incubation committee. Leads are coordinating the allocation of tasks and rewards to contributors. Squad leads report to the incubation committee which oversees their work. Squad leads will be rewarded for coordinating their squad depending on goals, expected required time and generated value for the project. Squad leads are able to assign tasks to themselves or squad contributors.\n\n### Contributors\nShineDAO contributors are all community members of ShineDAO. Contributors will be updated on sprint goals and are invited to participate in shaping the deliverables with squad leads. They have the opportunity to select a predefined task/ initiative from the squad lead for a predefined reward or propose an initiative with the requested reward themselves. Contributors can participate in multiple squads at once.\n\n\n# Communication\n### ShineDAO Discord server:\nDeFi Options DAO will get a dedicated channel in the section \u201cProjects\u201d.  The Incubation Committee will post weekly updates on the channel. Weekly updates are structured as key achievements in the previous week and plan for the next week. Chanel will be used for DeFi Options DAO announcements as well.\n\n### DeFi Options DAO Discord Server\nEach squad will have its dedicated open channel. Leads will be responsible for facilitating conversations within each squad channel.\n\nWe strongly recommend squad's contributors to share their progress, clear doubts, align decisions and actively communicate in their DeFi Options discord server channel, as to generate a browsable history of their work to help other contributors and to serve as a reference for future developments and revision by ShineDAO.\n", "choices": ["Approve", "Reject"], "start": 1621296000, "end": 1621555200, "snapshot": "12455084", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb1D92EEec6f9F224ABD294DE643C94A01cB14E51", "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth", "name": "ShineDAO"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTp9y4hzTRjQEATNPjALMZw1Wt93zzkAgNmqL4QPSeS7X", "voter": "0x4D119445eC81bff24234395cdA1E04113333E389", "created": 1621452025, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfRHG3CBXbMNm7G6EVczxcnHXHxq25fYej7rGwkgcZVsR", "voter": "0xCD75C47B2Ec49E92cC673269B53d1A75D023DfC9", "created": 1621377479, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYxEXj8VXUbhuXiMXgQCsDg6TyN4x5EwuecEdnfinLvVj", "voter": "0x2BF6717d4d7244Fb523d91c0e115455C567775B8", "created": 1621329136, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUGo1zmSvEuPySFFrn64yF6hYzxY75KRx9J1v6vJrXoi1", "voter": "0xD7fcf5B4feaCae6D5bf8574d000452aD871FA38B", "created": 1621326936, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUnmJ71nVUqBBFXzo8WgkK9Msd9N187rpxV36pxsEu18n", "voter": "0xc1cAd6df277106222Dd45cF5B0300fBd4d1193D5", "created": 1621322808, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWSLnZhyEUpE2yTVaJtfpHMCHAyHFqJjVMLLNymU9zNS2", "voter": "0xD6A902Eb3E714FCC889F96D4A165D98a3944B6ad", "created": 1621320670, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVHrPwVBzqG8GPZ1LD4mMDYK6VwbPeC25ivKdf3SyN5vX", "voter": "0xf059Fc4F5e620df1855e5c991C2b926E9C858b2C", "created": 1621317704, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZhBGm2jNjWVUwV2CNAWk2Wk1EXuq863BZ4BnvGn4wpGg", "voter": "0x2234D0A7D62B9f9c5ea4f08A60Cc35B548C7e932", "created": 1621316061, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS8is1baNn7Bv2mJkWnm9FsVtoA9VzyUG7fdtJkGTDgCe", "voter": "0xf0549d13B142B37F0663E6B52CE54BD312A2eDaa", "created": 1621310814, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}]}
