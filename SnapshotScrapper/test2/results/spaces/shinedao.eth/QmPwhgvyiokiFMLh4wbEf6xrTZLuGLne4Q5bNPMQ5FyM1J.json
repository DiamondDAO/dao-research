Splitting our Pre-sale into two tranches (I and II)\n2. Updating the price from previously planned pre-sale $0.02 to $0.025 (Pre-sale I) and $0.28 (Pre-sale II)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/XLrGwZM/Screenshot-2021-03-29-at-21-17-19.png)\n\n*Usage of Raised Funds:*\n1. Increasing funds planned for product development from 14% to 27%\n2. Decreasing funds planned for liquidity supply from 75% to 65%\n3. Decreasing funds planned for legal processes from 5% to 2%\n![](https://i.ibb.co/VYrsZpV/Screenshot-2021-03-29-at-21-20-09.png)\n\n# Motivation:\nWe are allocating most of the raised funds for providing liquidity at the listing. We believe a slight increase in the valuation and (re)allocating more resources available for product development will have a significant impact on the longevity of the DAO.\n\nDue to high demand and the fact that some of the most active community members and even core team members themselves missed the seed-sale opportunity, we would like to split the pre-sale into 2 parts. We are planning to expose only the Discord community & team members to Pre-sale I. For Pre-sale II we are planning to make an announcement on Twitter, to increase the size of the investor community.\n\nAfter conducting research on legal requirements for DAO, we learned that there will be fewer resources required for legal processes at this stage, therefore we are (re)allocating them to product development.", "choices": ["Approve", "Reject"], "start": 1617131700, "end": 1617397200, "snapshot": "12142413", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb1D92EEec6f9F224ABD294DE643C94A01cB14E51", "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth", "name": "ShineDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
