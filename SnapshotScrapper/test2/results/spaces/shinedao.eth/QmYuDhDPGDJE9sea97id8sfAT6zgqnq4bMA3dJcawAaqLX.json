{"id": "QmYuDhDPGDJE9sea97id8sfAT6zgqnq4bMA3dJcawAaqLX", "title": "[Proposal] Incentive System & Deal-flow", "body": "# Motivation:\nAt ShineDAO we believe that maximizing the success of early-stage teams requires more than just capital. The goal of this proposal is to introduce a model that allows teams and communities to engage in new incentivized relationships.\u2028\n# Requirements:\nBased on community feedback at the workshop held 8th April 2021, we identified the following incentive system requirements:\n* All members feel incentivized to purchase SHN so that they can get access to seed-sales and IDOs of incubated projects\n* All members feel incentivized to contribute to incubated projects so they can get rewards and higher cap/ person allocations\n* All members feel incentivized to bring new projects to ShineDAO to get rewards and higher cap/ person allocation\n* Value of SHN keeps increasing with demand for investing in its projects\n* Value of SHN keeps increasing if projects are successful in the long run (buyback mechanism)\n* Each member can have multiple roles\n* Each member feels the system is fair\n\n# Roles:\n**Investors:**\nContributors with >10000 SHN will have access to investor's cap/ person (lower) allocation at seed-sale and IDO. At least 50% of the seed-sale and at least 80% of IDO will be reserved for investors allocation.\n\n**Committee:**\nContributors with 300000 SHN will have access to committee cap/ person (higher) allocation at seed-sale and IDO. Up to 50% of the seed-sale and up to 20% of IDO will be reserved for committee allocation. They will have the ability to select and vote on a project for incubation.\u2028\n\n**Contributors:**\nContributors who provide technical and business support to projects will share 40% of the total token allocation to ShineDAO. They will have access to 3x investors cap/ person (lower) at IDO and no ability to invest in seed-sale (since the project did not receive any support yet at that stage).\n\n**Advisors:**\nExperts who provide insight and assistance in areas meaningful for the project will share 20% of total token allocation to ShineDAO. They will have access to 2x committee cap/ person (higher) at IDO and no ability to invest in seed-sale (since the project did not receive any support yet at that stage).\n\n**Deal hunter:**\nContributor that introduces new project to the community, receives 5% of total token allocation to ShineDAO if their project gets incubated. It gets access to 2x committee cap/ person (higher) allocation at seed-sale and IDO.\n\n**Teams:**\nEarly-stage blockchain teams will get seed-sale and IDO capital for their project as well as support from engaged and incentivized community of contributors and advisors. Because community and advisors will help them with finding product-market fit from day 1 of their incubation, they will be able to raise with higher evaluation at IDO while allocating 5%-20% of their total token supply as ShineDAO community reward allocation.\u2028\n\n**Facilitators:**\nThe core team of ShineDAO responsible for facilitation of the deal flow, and making sure teams have all recurses to make their projects successful.\n![](https://i.ibb.co/CW1TvMN/Deals-2x-1.png)\u2028\n\n# Deal-flow:\n![](https://i.ibb.co/mBct20J/Deals-2x-2.png)\u2028\n# Example reward calculation:\nGiven that the project is allocating 15% of their token as ShineDAO community reward, and the project reaches $5.000.000 fully diluted market capitalization we are presenting the following example calculation for MVP.\u2028\n![](https://i.ibb.co/dKZyWr3/Screenshot-2021-04-13-at-00-13-06.png)\n", "choices": ["Approve", "Reject"], "start": 1618330500, "end": 1618589700, "snapshot": "12231703", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb1D92EEec6f9F224ABD294DE643C94A01cB14E51", "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth", "name": "ShineDAO"}, "votes": 19, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPE48nuK6KYkDUChHQbxD9kxCpbCiyjnvfQZw1jpQ8qA2", "voter": "0x8303c76A8174EB5B5C5C9c320cE92f625A85eac2", "created": 1618571058, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVsA8ACmMZ4Vz6epAHJxCVKtonSiKM5RoizxBiNgdNjaX", "voter": "0xa9F000F31353c04c8F871F108fC00e84d7A8139C", "created": 1618561801, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbbXVC5ybRrKCyPoeUyTsEL5UkYppYcipVnsT6ju3KrGZ", "voter": "0xF4447a5AF62d46A73f19FFFA6Cc073d3a66D6360", "created": 1618484758, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUSLoBH79W2ZXJb6xAKXG6XTjWsQSPsDLJTAsYrnwqNNs", "voter": "0x17857dB1c69003499e8eE9f5e15EC8396865F04d", "created": 1618427059, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTPZHLF88mYeJpiQ6p1vj27L9gL9LLcSHwm7JHWe43fmN", "voter": "0x0915D396F0214427E5a80991cf23BeE49E846ff2", "created": 1618420683, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaGkcxrEfN29kit5p1sf9WZtq17RnEekApAiEW1Ba5qt8", "voter": "0x94C60011e90ff6F9cb9D6AD55Fa75DFd9EFB8Dc4", "created": 1618420385, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdoAWTKM1XugRWayX7ChSDNmHoRggYpeanXKGMigkz66N", "voter": "0xbafee8FD1331a26088183222Edb4160462631665", "created": 1618412336, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT4RZsLem11BFeKW4Sd9Bn7JHTvkfmNZfAQB2ZdQQPDw9", "voter": "0xFb70A9f9D1E1084d531A8F15D4c92cd855B752F7", "created": 1618407861, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS5QW5JBQY8FnePEKZfLSQkxqg6Ax1mD6Y9MW9tpbvHtD", "voter": "0xc1cAd6df277106222Dd45cF5B0300fBd4d1193D5", "created": 1618387216, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZV8WpnehnyVxcXPxyM4A6RvNEh1Y4DkrSgFjNXdsH6Hg", "voter": "0x06658Fd70023f527BFAc1A6d9141C56d99c65129", "created": 1618350464, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZQsvbv9dYL8gdbFK8gkBwaf4P2njVZamGmusrkww37MH", "voter": "0x4D119445eC81bff24234395cdA1E04113333E389", "created": 1618344546, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW84wz8YSVzkeHWRkdM4HscaQtmd457vNeZQC2RBZd64s", "voter": "0xaD5B894837b213a0891553CB7b2E81a2100A7259", "created": 1618343181, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeyKqXpzYfQ8xspVarBStr3YsnmB2eUxxsLPQ6Eeh5cge", "voter": "0xf49044760442DBe9dADe9028607A59E23c63a776", "created": 1618339146, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNbPYgsq3mUj8Bm9ebXAphRwsgFvdTwPCWiJ4GBwF5R7a", "voter": "0x2BF6717d4d7244Fb523d91c0e115455C567775B8", "created": 1618338559, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfL36iEwEfhxmudnSnczusdB3HLSEUZaZKruhpJ817GBj", "voter": "0x8EDAB1576B34b0BFdcdF4F368eFDE5200ff6F4e8", "created": 1618338345, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWyYcANXPiCQMuxJEMNX3vDcs27U5rrZXNU4RrqT1c77d", "voter": "0x00ABBc67c3F96d3760DCbc4F60BD89254bA94675", "created": 1618337652, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeaPmasVHQEZHTchxLsv72WyJtBFTr6c4mWu7v5oPu2AG", "voter": "0xd4431481DBe7791FDC147f5F7705D5eE9196D95E", "created": 1618332144, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf91dXH2xjjSgADpU17Yz5kF2dXSMWTsMaQJUHWbKLyFR", "voter": "0x765CAF0DeaB530c043eFbc494bE66Ed1c238d324", "created": 1618331962, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU54yb7BWE4aHxhiQh8EpLjogCcTuLxphRQLC3RwM1VcH", "voter": "0x4431B6E4201734f5DfC495Ef5A6b5DB045363359", "created": 1618331889, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shinedao.eth"}}]}
