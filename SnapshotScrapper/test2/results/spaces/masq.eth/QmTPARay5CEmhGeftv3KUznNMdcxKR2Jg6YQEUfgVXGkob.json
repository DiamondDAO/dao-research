This relates to both onboarding new MASQ Node users and also the incentive model for monetisation of nodes connected together in the mesh-network.\n\nThis vote result will show where popular support lies for three mainstream Ethereum based scaling solutions available.\n\n**Whichever solution gains the highest vote will be engaged by the MASQ Network core team to start integration and deployment as soon as possible.**\n\n## Reasoning\nThe gas and network congestion issues on Ethereum are both extremely disruptive and cost-prohibitive to many users. To be most effective and promote mass-adoption, the MASQ Node software must integrate a reliable scaling solution to solve extreme fluctuations in gas prices and provide relatively fast transaction speeds \u2014 all while not compromising security.\nThis is most important to maintain the monetization model which secures the node mesh-network and allows maximum utility incentives for MASQ Node users routing and serving traffic on the MASQ Network.\nThis is also critical for the success of alpha and beta releases of GEMINI v0.2.x\n\n*Important to state here, that this won\u2019t remove or limit the use of the MASQ Node software on Ethereum mainnet (or other future blockchains), rather it provides MASQ Network with an Ethereum based full-stack utility layer to leverage the benefits of scaling and reduced transaction gas costs.*\n\n## Important Points to Consider for Voting\n\n#### Here is some information to consider regarding each proposed scaling solution:\n\n**Polygon Network**\nPolygon (also know prior as Matic Network) started in 2017 and has a Proof-of-Stake sidechain secured by Ethereum\u2019s consensus model. It is by far the most mature and secure network being built as a full-stack scaling solution.\nMATIC serves as the native gas token and gas costs are extremely small \u2014 0.001 MATIC is enough gas to fund nearly 100 transactions on Polygon network.\nMoving between ETH and Polygon, tokens must be bridged across to the Polygon chain using a bridge contract, requiring an on-chain transaction. Withdrawals can be completed for PoS sidechain assets, such as ERC20 tokens bridged, in under 3 hours.\nPolygon provides a mapping portal to easily bridge ERC20 tokens to their Polygon chain for both mainnet and testnet with a support desk.\nThe Polygon team has been both very reliable in their communication and supportive of MASQ Network in recent meetings, referring to us as a \u2018high quality project\u2019 they would like to see join their ecosystem.\n\n**Optimism**\nOptimism started in early 2020 and labels themselves as a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). Optimism is early in the expansion of their mainnet and is a \u2018rollup solution\u2019 \u2014in simple terms this involves large numbers of transactions happen off-chain in a bundle, saving cost and increasing throughput. They boast speeds of up to 100 times more throughput than Ethereum. Unfortunately, this also requires that any withdrawals to the L1 Ethereum mainnet must go through a 7 day challenge period before released on-chain to ETH.\nThe native gas token remains ETH on Ethereum, so there is no requirement to use a different token for gas. ERC20 tokens are required to be bridged to the Optimism side-chain. Currently 14 assets are listed on the official Optimism token-list for their gateway (found here).\nThere are some differences in the JSON-RPC API, which will require further development in the MASQ Node software.\nOptimism currently restricts mainnet contract deployment to a whitelist (announced here) but has scripts on their GitHub for developers to explore.\nOptimism has been sent an application from the MASQ Team to support our project and ERC20 bridge contract, but we are waiting for further reply.\n\n**Arbitrum**\nOffchain Labs created the Arbitrum sidechain by forking Optimism\u2019s code in 2020 and iterating it further\u2014 it\u2019s rollups and fraud proofs pinpoint any issues within rollup bundles so validators work quicker, meaning it potentially has higher throughput than Optimism. Similar to Optimism, any withdrawals to the L1 Ethereum mainnet must go through a 7 day challenge period before released on-chain to ETH.\nCurrently, their team has launched the ArbitrumOne mainnet beta release, and has significantly more projects, tokens and dapps onboarded than Optimism.\nSimilar to Optimism, the native gas token is ETH so no secondary token is required. ERC20 tokens are required to be bridged to their network \u2014 only 30\u201340 assets are supported on Arbitrum currently, with several hundred further project applications being vetted by the Offchain Labs developers.\nThe Arbitrum team has not replied yet to the MASQ listing request to be supported, but they appear to be onboarding projects quickly after they deploy contracts to the ArbitrumOne beta mainnet.\n\n### Voting Mechanics\n**Voting will open Thursday 00:00 30 September UTC and runs for 4 full days, concluding Sunday 23:59 3 October UTC**\n\n- For this introductory proposal, holders of MASQ-WETH SLP in their wallets AND within Crucibles are eligible to vote.\n- SLP that is subscribed to GEMINI Aludel is eligible to vote right from the Crucible wallet (Alchemy magic ftw)\n- Each wallet containing MASQ-WETH SLP tokens can vote once, for one of the 3 options\n- Each vote will be weighted by the amount of MASQ-WETH SLP held by the wallet/Crucible.\n- The main Sushiswap MASQ-WETH SLP provided from the team will not be eligible to vote.", "choices": ["Polygon", "Optimism", "Arbitrum"], "start": 1632960000, "end": 1633219200, "snapshot": "13317500", "state":
