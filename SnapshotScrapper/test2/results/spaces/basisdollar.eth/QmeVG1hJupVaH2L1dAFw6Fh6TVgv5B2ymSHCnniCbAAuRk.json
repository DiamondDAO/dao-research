This was the 4-week phase in which the initial emission of BSD via the seed bank farms was generated.\n\nAt this juncture, with this milestone reached, we would like to put forward a compensation proposal for the time & efforts of the 2 non-dev admins/mods on the project, for the period of time up to 15 Jan 2021, noon UTC.\n\nThey are:\n@markpui on Telegram (@markpui on Discord), started 18 Dec 2020.\n@jleony on Telegram (@sweetpotato on Discord), started 31 Dec 2020.\n\nWork performed:\n@markpui generated an early set of documents & explainers, and has recently focused on facilitating structured governance.\n@jleony has focused on providing more admin/mod availability across different time zones, plus adds additional language capabilities to the team.\n\nProposed compensation: Equal payment for each, set at the community's choice of:\n1. 5,000 BSD each.\n2. 10,000 BSD each.\nNote: Both non-devs agreed to the equal pay mechanism, regardless of community's choice of (1) or (2), as they work well together and support each other.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Compensate non-dev admins/mods for their time and efforts.\n2. All USDC and DAI (stable financial assets) are retained at the DAO.\n3. Rather than a fixed locked-in, recurring payment, the community can vote on payment to be made based on work performance (Pay-for-performance).\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. This reduces the BSD balance (currently 78,949 BSD) held at the DAO https://etherscan.io/address/0x46262af08d6b795efb08b4a6e486208f889e0c60", "choices": ["YES: Pay 10k BSD each.", "YES: Pay 5k BSD each.", "NO: Do not pay non-devs."], "start": 1610712000, "end": 1610928000, "snapshot": "11660014", "state": "closed", "author": "0xF8E802f5adE72D09a601cebD027d00779f5f8C2B", "space": {"id": "basisdollar.eth", "name": "BasisDollar"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPswNurzMPKwdEgS4mdgPCTZh8mj3UzP8R813Y9pMUE9S", "voter": "0x4EC7CdF61405758f5cED5E454c0B4b0F4F043DF0", "created": 1610833161, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "basisdollar.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmei266DxJ5nQwXcTmzwj8BdgukGd97wJES9FkSZdfFbSs", "voter": "0xc8Cb5C594E3A8a10C88a7054a0eD331620916596", "created": 1610822210, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "basisdollar.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQun1t9kWdNZdbPxE1zkVQUBKAa2Z7ZE9MSB6WVJRpdiS", "voter": "0x353408BC10d8CbC260d8cb4269e3a35BaF35Dbc8", "created": 1610815279, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "basisdollar.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmecnjp93vf8S4WSuR4n2kQum6Z5ZMEbVcPagbXq3ZitRD", "voter": "0x55a3df57B7AAEC16a162fD5316f35bEC082821CF", "created": 1610794056, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "basisdollar.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd3wk6gTRp9zE3o4McUy8uaCf2tugW9Lg75qRhv1N6tjo", "voter": "0xb6F4F9aa0df072C190bEce1bdB40E7edE629BdaF", "created": 1610792038, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "basisdollar.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQQEYVTp2CJEaHcdoiG2jUWXaa9RHYWzEhwzr1YxcksAc", "voter": "0x442E73cdCF761D536a66Ec40D59313F1B8c52937", "created": 1610791850, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "basisdollar.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma4U989hnD56HrDL6UTBgNyWmMcRinYvag6FNdXXR7WW3", "voter": "0xC7bC516E8F62E854cF4c458D68d77E29a90268b6", "created": 1610752161, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "basisdollar.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcTkRVsaHK6Gh3RqGxvcJZyoRmJiLa3Ty2FVdv6ttZywu", "voter": "0x7aFc8cD084953E76123612c0ed15D9e9a2A1EF8c", "created": 1610737088, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basisdollar.eth"}}]}
