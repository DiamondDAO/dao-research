{"id": "QmbNUKkar6vFbjgG1uXfHqJ513XJMCJbzYAVdA4onZENNv", "title": "BDIP13 (Formal vote): Use DAO as stabilizer", "body": "Note: This is a modified version of an earlier proposal https://gov.basisdollar.fi/#/basisdollar.eth/proposal/QmfPqJpQYVhycXF3NugRaVe5aYbAYxSn4hnTf9F1YGjNfZ\n\nKey difference is the inclusion of a liquidity threshold:\n- If the combined TVL of the BSD/DAI and BSD/USDC liquidity farms is below $500k, and TWAP BSD <$0.95.\n- If the combined TVL of the BSD/DAI and BSD/USDC liquidity farms is above $3,000,000 and TWAP BSD >$1.05.\n\nProposal:\nUse the DAO fund to act as a stabilizer.\n1. Use DAO assets during contractionary cycles.\n2. Sell DAO assets during expansionary cycles.\n\nDuring contraction, use DAO assets to buy up BSD to speed up return to $1.\nDuring expansion, use DAO assets to sell BSD and BSDS to accumulate more resources for contraction.\n\nHow it works (Mechanism):\n\nCheck if TWAP BSD < $0.95 once per hour (or every 240 blocks).\nIf TWAP BSD < $0.95 \nAND\nIf the combined TVL of the BSD/DAI and BSD/USDC liquidity farms is below $500,000\nTHEN use up to 2% of DAI and USDC to buy up BSD from the LPs, subject to the condition that the max. purchase price is $0.95 post-slippage.\n\nCheck if TWAP BSD < $1.05 once per hour (or every 240 blocks).\nIf TWAP BSD > $1.05\nAND\nIf the combined TVL of the BSD/DAI and BSD/USDC liquidity farms is above $3,000,000\nTHEN sell up to 2% of BSD in the DAO for USD and DAI, subject to the condition that the min. sale price is $1.05 post-slippage, \n\nThe $0.05 gap is to leave it to the market to close the remaining to $1.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1. During expansion, builds up a pool of assets in the form of USDC and DAI in the DAO. Maximizes the value of DAO resources as it converts BSD (which is intended to be long-term stable at $1) into USDC and DAI at prices of more than $1. The DAO therefore collateralizes the system.\n2. During contraction, the USDC and DAI in the DAO is used to support BSD price.\n\nDisadvantage:\n1. DAO competes with market participants.
