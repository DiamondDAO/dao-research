The rate of BSD printing may result in rapid\ndeceleration of BSD price past $1, until it is below $1.\nMechanism Change inflation cap to 2.5% per epoch when BSD > $1.\nAdvantages \u2022 Reduces inflation during an epoch where BSD > %1.\nDisadvantages \u2022 The APY on Seignorage Shares will decline as BSD inflation will be reduced. However, this may\nlead to normalized, sustainable long-term APY, rather than short-term capital that moves in and\nout.\n\u2022 Due to the reduction in BSD emission when BSD > $1, there will also be less BSD available for\nbonds to be redeemed (ensuring that all bondholders will tend to be come long-term\nbondholders rather than short-term bondholders).\n", "choices": ["YES, lets go to the moon !", "no, I am scared of moon :("], "start": 1610190000, "end": 1610215200, "snapshot": "11621520", "state": "closed", "author": "0x94FeC25207Dd24136472f4d80ab1B158B3a28775", "space": {"id": "basisdollar.eth", "name": "BasisDollar"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmarDNfM1fi2kx3ayL7CVuYonUX9bjhMNgYDeLJEu3NPaC", "voter": "0x94FeC25207Dd24136472f4d80ab1B158B3a28775", "created": 1610209766, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basisdollar.eth"}}]}
