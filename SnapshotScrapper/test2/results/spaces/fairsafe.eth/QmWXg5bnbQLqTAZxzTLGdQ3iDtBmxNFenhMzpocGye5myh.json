This is a win-win for us. It's good for the charity and it's good publicity for us.  It also goes to establishing this project as different.  Maybe part of the charity at some point could be scholarship or other help for FAIRSAFE hodlers.  \n\nRight now the proposal is just to move forward to identify charity options.  We would come back to the community with an amount to donate and several charity options.
