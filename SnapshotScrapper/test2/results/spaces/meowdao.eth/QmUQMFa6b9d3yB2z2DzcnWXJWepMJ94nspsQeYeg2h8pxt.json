The map is covered with dots that represent candidate shelters. When user hovers over a dot, shelter name is displayed and the dot is clickable to access the shelter and its information on the voting page. \n\nA sample of what this page may look like is at the link below:\nhttps://ibb.co/tZcb1Hj\n\n{Priority and Curb Appeal}\nList milestones in priority\nMilestone 1:\nShelter information along with Wallet Addresses\n\n~Abstract, Why, How, When~\nPeople want to know what they're voting for. Consolidating the information listed above in modification #2 would make learning about shelters and voting a fast, easy, pleasurable user process. \n\nTeam Necessary for Milestone\nVolunteer devs/web designers. Number unknown, timeframe unknown. \n\nMilestone 2:\nIntroductory Paragraph on Voting page \n\n\"We're here for the cats. The MEOW EnDAOment awards 3% APY of total staked MEOW to a community-elected animal shelter.  Candidate shelters are proposed by MeowDAO community members. Each candidate is eligible to receive community votes; the shelter with the most votes by (XX/XX/XXXX at XX:XX) will receive the MEOW EnDAOment for the next cycle (beginning XX/XX/XXXX).\n\nConnect your Ethereum wallet to vote. Each $MEOW in the wallet counts as 1 vote toward your shelter of choice.  For more information on voting, staking, and electing a shelter, click here.\n\nBelow is the current list of shelters that have been elected by MeowDAO community members.\"\n\nTime between M1-M2:  Likely instantaneous\n\nMilestone 3:\nUsers should be able to filter the shelter list based on different elements including name, current vote count, and location. \n\nTime between M2-M3: Unknown/developer timeline\n\n\nMilestone 4:\nLocation Map Mode . A map mode allowing users to select and view candidate shelters based on location.\n\nTime between M3-M4: Unknown/developer timeline.\n\n{Manifestations}\nThis is a major step in the right direction of making MeowDAO accessible to more charitable users. Voting and charity are what we're all about- let's make this aspect shine bright. \n\n\n{Your commitment to the Dao}\nThis project will see major success with community and perseverance. I will be there with it and help it along how I can.", "choices": ["Approve", "Decline"], "start": 1620356400, "end": 1621220400, "snapshot": "12384348", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6163A8E6dFEBcc912C46E50E7EAFB646dCA5A941", "space": {"id": "meowdao.eth", "name": "MeowDao"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTDSMWrkcvtmKTYUtqXxcj9eZfVxLhgGvcvgPpA1utoEY", "voter": "0xEAA35C9911470d7a780Be64a093f01C72FcBf34E", "created": 1621033812, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "meowdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVRLRNze5ypsc4zTTdeFuoLeHYG1NgWsMp2RP15j3ocrT", "voter": "0xb14CCF6a80bf1f41734fDb14B6c8F3586183dc5c", "created": 1620719493, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "meowdao.eth"}}]}
