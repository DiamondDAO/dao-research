", "body": "Hello everyone, \nI want to propose migrating some of the treasury funds to Polygon for the follwing **purposes**:\n\n1.   To set up a LP on Polygon\n2.  To buy some $Blok.\n3. To pay out Contributor Rewards on Polygon.\n4.  To fund the Polygon staking contract (this gets decided in a seperate [Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/metagamehub.eth/proposal/0x7608cedf0b3028e4f95e40eccec10fbb56971fc81bae74254d103f8ef8231540))\n\nReasoning: \n---\n1.  Cheap trading for everyone. People who just want to invest small amounts to be part of the community can now do so. Get exposure from Polygon Ecosystem\n\n2. Bloktopia is a promosing project that is already established, but still has a lot of potential for growth, so the allocation in $BLOK could pay.\nWe would be positioned well to buy Bloktopia lands as soon as the opportunity arises.\n\n3. Contributor rewards can be small, getting paid out on Polygon would be more rewarding for Contributors, because their funds will be more liquid and useable than on Ethereum.\n\nSpecifications: \n---\n1.  We set up a Pool with 300k liquidity on 1.12.  and migrate USDC and MGH accordingly.\n\n2. We migrate 50k USDC and buy $BLOK for 1k USD everyday for 50 days to mitigate the influence of market fluctuations.\n", "choices": ["nope", "dope"], "start": 1637582400, "end": 1637668800, "snapshot": "9689255", "state": "closed", "author": "0x382511Ab458A8e55be45F81BDb78c0b25E2148F2", "space": {"id": "philantrop.eth", "name": "Philantrop"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
