I am sure many of you read this on the discord but here we should formalize it. \n\nOverall, the mechanism will consist in being able to purchase \"flies\" with STACK token and feed them to your toads in order to upgrade their staking daily rewards. Taking into account this, the proposal is the following:\n\n2. Upgrading your toads (StackedToads)\n\nOnce you have your flies you can feed them to your toads. You will be able to feed them MAXIMUM 4 times a week and you will improve the staking by 1.25 STACK/DAY per each upgrade. Each upgrade will cost 3 flies, in this way you will have one fully upgraded toad giving 100 STACK/DAY in 10 weeks (This would be the maximum). In total your toad would have been fed 120 flies with a cost of 10800 STACK.\n\nCost is three flies per upgrade because the NFT has 3 toads to feed.\n\n3. Upgrading your toads (Unstackedtoads)\n\nOnce you have your flies you can feed them to your toads. You will be able to feed them MAXIMUM 4 times a week and you will improve the staking by 1.25 STACK/DAY per each upgrade. Each upgrade will cost 1 fly, in this way you will have one fully upgraded toad giving 10 STACK/DAY in 8 weeks (This would be the maximum). In total your toad would have been fed 12 flies with a cost of 360 STACK.\n\nCost is three flies per upgrade because the NFT has 1 toad to feed.\n\n4. Hungry toads penalization\n\nYour toads have a minimum/initial staking (5 STACK/DAY for unstacked & 50 STACK/DAY for stacked) and a maximum upgrade (10 STACK/DAY for unstacked & 100 STACK/DAY for stacked). Once you start feeding your toads they will enjoy eating their food. However, if you stop doing it after certain time they will get hungry and their staking rewards will drop until initial levels.\n\nOnce you start feeding your toad, in order to mantain your rewards, you need to feed your toads this way:\n\nSTACKEDTOADS --> AT LEAST 4 flies a month (360 STACK/MONTH) around 10% of monthly staking\nUNSTACKEDTOADS --> AT LEAST 1 fly each three months  (90 STACK/MONTH) at least 10% of three months staking\n\nIf you fail with this conditions, after 30 days of not feeding your toad your toad will start downgrading in the following manner:\n\nSTACKETOADS --> Each week, after 30 days of not being fed, your toad will start burning the flies it has stored. First week it will lose 2 flies. Second week it will lose 4 flies. Third week it will lose 8 flies. Fourth week it will lose 16 flies. Fifth week it will lose 20 flies. This means that after 9 weeks of not feeding your toad (1 month warning + 5 weeks) your toad will come back to initial levels.\n\nUNSTACKEDTOADS --> After 90 days of not being fed your toad will start burning flies. After one week it will burn 2 flies and the next the other 2 remaining flies. Like that your toad will be back to its minimum.\n\nThese penalisations are done so there is a continuous burn of stack and there is also an incentive to buy stackedtoads on OS, while compensating the 40% discount that results cheaper from feeding a toad than buying a toad (measure in tokens, and explained in point number 5). Here is where things get interesting. Do you prefer buying a full toad that will do not require maintenance or upgrade your toad and feed it continuously. Maybe the first will increase floor price as there is a big demand for those. If thats the case then floor will rise and many people will have to start upgrading their toads. I feel is a healthy balance.\n\n5. Flies Pricing\n- The pricing was really hard to determine. We can change it but I thought it this way. A stackedtoad produces 18250 STACK/year, so working around with numbers I thought upgrading your toad to 100 STACK/DAY should be cheaper than buying a stacktoad from the market, so in this way we promote burning STACK and skating/holding. \n\nI thought getting a full upgrade to stacktoads (100 STACK/DAY) should be 40% less than the amount of STACK another stackedtoad picked from the market would produce. In this way, someone that wants the immediate rewards can go buy floor for a premium while someone that is willing to stake, can earn the equivalent future production cheaper, but in a longer term.\n\nIn this way, upgrading a full toad should cost 10950 STACK, which is 60% of the STACK an stackedtoad would produce yearly. Lets say that we want to be able to do this in a span of 10 weeks. Taking into account a max of 4 feed per week, this would have a price 273.75STACK per upgrade, or around 91.25 STACK per fly (Assuming you need three flies per upgrade). So lets get a whole number, 90 STACK/FLY.\n\nYou might be asking yourself, why so cheap. Here is the trick, upgraded toads have a maintenance right? As mentioned above, a toad has to be fed certain times before it starts downgrading. In this way, upgraded stackedtoads have a continuous cost of at least 360 STACK per month.\n\n**I am assuming that most of the projects with an utility token are valued at the yearly amount of utility tokens the produce per year (Just check similar projects, convert to USD or ETH values if you wish). **\n\n6. SUMMARY\n!4s and upgrade your toad, each fly will have a cost of 90 STACK and will improve the staking capabilities your toads. However, if you let them starve, they will downgrade to original capabilities.\n\nThis is a rough sketch, there might be some clarifications and tweaks before final version. I just think is a interactive and interesting way to burn mechanism and give us some connections to our NFTs. They will become our \"pets\" and we will have to take care of them in exchange for better rewards. in case someone is wondering, I did the maths. If all stackedtoads and unstacked toads are upgraded that would mean an increase of supply of 155,000, more or less what the daily LP rewards are atm. This is tried to be compensated with the fact that more than 1 million could be burned in order to avoid penalisations each month.\n\nI think this would work as a continuous incentive to burn STACK and staking/hold, but it need to happen when LP rewards are lower and other burning mechanisms that are more sporadic such as the arcade/casino/raffles, also help to make the coin deflationary.\n\nTAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THESE THE VOTES SHOULD COUNT TOWARDS THIS IDEA BEING DEVELOPED, CHECKED AND REDISING, OR JUST NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.\n\n", "choices": ["Chech and execute on this", "Not consider it at all"], "start": 1634101200, "end": 1635138000, "snapshot": "13407378", "state": "closed", "author": "0x04A764Cf89Ed0c4cf64D2190E2E7BeF04462DE9b", "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth", "name": "StackedToadz"}, "votes": 14, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUCCKrgsjU1Rpv6vxkHHF59knaLzq6Z8i5smZMEEXDpNU", "voter": "0x401CC1B6620e30ade449BB8f593a0d0799FbAC93", "created": 1634200941, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc24ySnAarBKM4cZvDsN1djZLuzupHVwc6FCJ9TL5f2sr", "voter": "0x6956fEA4F0C6d01fdC53487559300B65353884B0", "created": 1634144153, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmemWLrW2mK9WeMFUG87fTBS4yptVhuxAAuTh5ddecHrja", "voter": "0x78EDb0777e8f29912Ad2E5bc9e3b0eEAcF1D7F10", "created": 1634140622, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX5QK4L1sHnJ2FZbFyMy5KSRtip4r5rf3yfApoMQLxxz3", "voter": "0x238AF33cFd9e7e8e679F8eD3fCB23cA210970c25", "created": 1634140117, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ3kiF2zBpwZexcVvbhYHt3nK84oCjNt9yqDScdEDviMX", "voter": "0x0C621a7De7993473fee82c579Ef04059d0332Fa6", "created": 1634139886, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma6e8po81EWM4jV8i5MNcYQVvSVx7RS7fi59AoUdJZeSc", "voter": "0x2E1aA62E9961468480e27039161Ea712824fE221", "created": 1634138960, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP99czr6ZBuczH6TLGPNLeUSrsHj9Jqu13rZEp65ivpVq", "voter": "0xbF146E9b90297470Ae466800e365AFC08C9af9ac", "created": 1634134371, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb11Myh8qxkUqcRGDrwLF6jvoRRxWcmD6r52bbrLo6FLD", "voter": "0x7E82CD11BdbfAE5e21fb7fA8C6255885512D784C", "created": 1634133268, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVezVFktwpZjyHzyBmT2h9NVCsvdnPZDKi1UsCtKLTWMp", "voter": "0xD5e94db07aD9c2c14C02dA82956e3C00D6a8e09f", "created": 1634132949, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdLdim8hdTb4UtgkjsTuBteugxia9R3jWq1RH38yP5pAz", "voter": "0x96eCa8bCCdA5092898B7E664a45cDfC099F3BD3a", "created": 1634128621, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd9eDrFyUX5c5zY6hY2XGom9F6CX5GaPnzLb1sd8b3GMA", "voter": "0x4C6C737502D9d2107c72D4c9E780D5ad2dbD0A1f", "created": 1634128092, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc7v57LAzg2UpA6JiEacJkJ7tkrDN3rZA3T889qhSE2oy", "voter": "0xc5EFD74b181fc7682C021609fC3dF2ccDC602aD2", "created": 1634121259, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQeCm1VFTXiztEYsGX9vW2o5MmREFz3rJ9f1WNedpHwkw", "voter": "0x9D72F197b9CeF08B56a280DbBd495aE1c026e9Aa", "created": 1634121141, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQC1e2vpRroohTDQA4574sYhLSqPuKnK4ZzbMAti1JE4o", "voter": "0xd06aE0F64D80f3Fb118B4C2a6A974Fa9b08363EC", "created": 1634115048, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stackedtoadzdao.eth"}}]}
