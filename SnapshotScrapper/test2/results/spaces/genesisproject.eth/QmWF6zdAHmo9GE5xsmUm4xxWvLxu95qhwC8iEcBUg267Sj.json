Note that without the LPs putting in Mana and ETH, the pool would go away. So we are proposing:\n\n**Change fees to:**\n> \u2022 15% to Sell (sellers receive 0~.85x the floor price), up a bit from 10%\n> \u2022 8% to Buy (buyers pay ~1.08x the floor price), down from 15%\n> \u2022 2% for a Random Buy (pay ~1.02 to pick a random GM from the pool)\n\nSo while this proposal lowers the premiums slightly for the LPs, we think it will help the community + it\u2019s in the spirit of the values and vibes of this project as a collaborative game.\n\n**The hypothesis:**\nThis change will help players succeed at resurrecting GAs more effectively, while having limited impact on sellers who just want to sell to the pool and not play the game.\n\nThis whole thing is a grand experiment, and the NFTx pool has become a critical tool to help us all play and win this collaborative game together. \n\nPlease vote below!\n", "choices": ["NO Change: 15% Buy Fee, 10% Sell", "CHANGE: 8% Buy Fee, 15% Sell"], "start": 1634227200, "end": 1634432400, "snapshot": "13417484", "state": "closed", "author": "0x204A731a626438a0B2A657378668cfBFe70a90F5", "space": {"id": "genesisproject.eth", "name": "Genesis Project"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmURpMLPJfkbp3PyBZkG2V9Qv4jSg7kQf3aHPySM6aFgsL", "voter": "0xF2c06f90FB58844C09220e01E3116A2293Df6960", "created": 1634369534, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "genesisproject.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ92uvb5rJQiBK2hNR15KsXgJSdzh8xk2tVyRM6ZwTAKk", "voter": "0x5F7670321668e6db551E39e7A5DFF443d42Dc97f", "created": 1634245248, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "genesisproject.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZKDRkCmhSWpA1YpTmtYub61SqSoLqGMapQMVGpiqAfkN", "voter": "0xE332de3c84C305698675A73F366061941C78e3b4", "created": 1634242039, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "genesisproject.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPofqvBB6F36vRvtgygnbeQLHNushM6cryKZBGRioCuWP", "voter": "0x38A4D889a1979133FbC1D58F970f0953E3715c26", "created": 1634239761, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "genesisproject.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPaVsTpSc1YV4PHWM4SSWWAmU76MYraojZMZcEQYK3yUw", "voter": "0xfCCe78aBc832BC9f7F1935e729348FaA9e959323", "created": 1634239613, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "genesisproject.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfDkeB7CB5Hoao63A9CpbpwH3hzSbESUYMkoMwcpdicjp", "voter": "0x6887444a5B74B746F56ae08952f4e1B404ff7ca5", "created": 1634236332, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "genesisproject.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQbYgZeTKj1uxP6nxomNCoXASay9kCYGjmGuJu77aA9EP", "voter": "0xC761DB8DFcdE67D81c58B04F7CC8ac6fA58F0749", "created": 1634231552, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "genesisproject.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS9tuQLo91CNLLPvPkjdLc7sNfHsrsNyhP2dRMmCyvFXX", "voter": "0x1B9d39Da4AaB19DcCfbc17A16F876EfFCC73eafD", "created": 1634230480, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "genesisproject.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWt9gM2ZVUWumqe52Qu9FESoss6o3u7HxdraRxSQjMaPr", "voter": "0x6EBd8991fC87F130DE28DE4b37F882d6cbE9aB28", "created": 1634230280, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "genesisproject.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZEWNzk9GA5C9Ygtz567SakHD8X6jcSnSeFZVFMQq5Yac", "voter": "0x722Bd8c51522b55E0e0BEa909b1e80f250A860eF", "created": 1634230276, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "genesisproject.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUKfTznq2gTbPt3zgHfoKw4HrkFFwKJVF1yaTNitY9iWh", "voter": "0xA9Cdf0542a1128C5cAca1E81521A09aEc8abe1a7", "created": 1634230226, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "genesisproject.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVYyGFvLAR499fYbY7AUc7NMzvicQu6U3gQT1ksD4x6gW", "voter": "0x0A0e66d48B10D8Be7Bf55aB8B3441701CbB6fB18", "created": 1634230173, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "genesisproject.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW8Jz3SrN18BUrLPropBeBJwfp35MfwmqJgz6s3pNYdkW", "voter": "0xaFbc3F98EEDB5f9A25a4AB2232d1346612efE77C", "created": 1634230121, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "genesisproject.eth"}}]}
