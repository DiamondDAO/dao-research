One person controls the Airtable db and gives write permissions to email accounts of Modem holders. (If we want full transparency we can require people to sign a message that includes their email and match that to Modem holder addresses.) They also connect the Twitter account to Airtable.\n\n2. Users with db access add a tweet to a queue.\n\n3. Every X hours the next tweet in the queue gets posted to Twitter.\n\n# Risks\nAnyone who has access to the db can tweet and we may not all agree on what they are tweeting. This requires a high degree of trust.", "choices": ["Yes let's do it!", "No. Not worth it."], "start": 1624579200, "end": 1624665600, "snapshot": "12699886", "state": "closed", "author": "0x8d2c1Ac35B37F3c0137b5cE94Ed9a1a3Da0e910e", "space": {"id": "apesonline.eth", "name": "Apes Online"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
