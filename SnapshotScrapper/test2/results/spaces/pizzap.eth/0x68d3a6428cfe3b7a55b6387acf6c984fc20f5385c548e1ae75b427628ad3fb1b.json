It only sees the user experience layer but knows nothing about the underlying logic, so they use the logic of the Internet to come up with something that looks very powerful but very strange. The demands of users entering the Crypto field are completely different from those of people entering the Internet products, the evaluation system is also different, the capital tendency is also different, and the circle approval standard is even different.
