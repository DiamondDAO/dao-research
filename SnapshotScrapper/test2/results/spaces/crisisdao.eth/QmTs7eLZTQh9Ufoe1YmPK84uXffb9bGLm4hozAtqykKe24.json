Please review the charter and vote below. \n\n* Please vote **yes** to pass the charter. \n* If you want to revisit and go back to the drawing board, vote **no**.\n\nYou can visit the charter here: https://hackmd.io/PIH8UL0oQOeB10xyLvhpmw?edit\n\nCharter is below:\n----\n\n## 1. About Crisis DAO\n\n### Why it exists\n    \nCrisisDAO started when a group of technologists deliberately set out to recruit people from diverse backgrounds drawn by a common interest to explore the use of bleeding-edge technologies in the blockchain. Through tinkering, peer learning, and mentoring, we investigate new types of organizational decision-making to decipher what incentives may look like for an equitable organization.\n\nOur thesis is that by building an investment DAO based on a frictionless, open, self-governing, cross-border agreement at scale and speed, we can create more sustainable and equitable participation and control and be more financially profitable than traditional companies.\n    \n### Mission\n    \nCrisisDAO is dedicated to creating open, self-governing, financially successful, blockchain-driven, cross-border agreement at scale and speed.\n    \n### Vision\n    \nTo make CrisisDAO a new model for organizing human endeavors incorruptible, immutable, and equitable.\n\n### Defining Success\n    \nIf the CrisisDAO is successful, we will prove our protocols and systems work by having outsized financial returns with minimal harm on the earth or any living creature; and by increasing participation of our members and by others replicating our documented learnings.\n    \nA successful DAO is one that makes progress toward the future as described in the vision. This means five things:\n    \n1. Members are participating.\n2. Proposals are created, a portion of which are successful.\n3. Financial gains are realised. \n4. Lessons are learned, laws (code) are written or amended.\n5. The process from 2 to 4 is documented so as to increase both participation of members and the learning of how DAO\u2019s work.\n\n\n---\n\n## 2. Members Privileges and Obligations\n\nLike a co-operative, members have the privilege to enjoy rewards, and in return, they have shared responsibilities toward a common goal. The CrisisDAO requires high member participation to be successful; it is not for spectators, therefore we as members:\n\n1. Participate in the discussion, creation, voting and documentation of proposals.\n2. Make friction, tension and inefficiencies known to all DAO members, so that changes, improvements and learning can take place.\n3. Monitor and record progress, for the creation of metrics to measure DAO health.\n\n### Membership Requirements\n\n* By contributing to the DAO, you agree to be governed by this Charter\n* Agree with the Code of Ethics\n* Comply with the Code of Conduct\n* Participate in the official communications channels on a regular basis\n* [Link to Membership Document](https://hackmd.io/WYOfX4VfTmqJidQZWkP5dQ)\n\n### New Members\n\nCrisisDAO is open to all. However, we are temporarily restricting membership until processes/software allows for safe scaling of DAO. For details on safety, see [security team doc](https://hackmd.io/4_FDfBnPQbqGI7IuoZoEbw).\n\n### Code of Conduct and Ethics\n\nSee annex [Code of Conduct draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jsH5YjkvkZW2LSoakjivk4wzPupAW7R0WsWjrR8laT0/edit?usp=sharing).\nSee annex [Code of Ethics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GpEgORanfwwvrG8x4L6EYLmJ8nQ0RzJXtSh9uQW10Dk/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n### Resolving Conflicts\n\nConflicts and disagreements are normal and part of any human endeavor. As a brand new organization, CrisisDAO doesn\u2019t have all the answers yet. Members are expected to apply our values in creating and modifying the instruments for conflict resolution.\nSee annexure [Resolving conflict](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LFPuEd7asvzpCUc-LnWBdgeztRcokaesylEDmxOWn5Q/edit#heading=h.vorb1hmx6g5h).\n\n### Taxes\n\nTaxes are a Member\u2019s own responsibility. Nothing the DAO or the members provide constitutes legal advice.\n\n\n---\n\n## 3. DAO Operations and Governance\n\nDAOs are decentralized organizations. The CrisisDAO builds on shared interests managed through open and secure software that will help in the DAO\u2019s governance. As we experiment with its day to day operations, we should always consider:\n\n1. Is our operation following the long-term vision of CrisisDAO?\n2. If the solution is repeatable and should be coded into software.\n\n### Operating Agreement\n\nThe DAO is currently using the [Operating Agreement from May 27, 2021](https://hackmd.io/8kB9cHYXQIyOZj-VFcIR6g). Any changes to the Operating Agreement must be proposed and passed.\n\n### Proposals\n\n* All Proposals will conform to the default time periods of:\n    * 2 days to vote\n    * and quorum thresholds unless classified as a different type of Proposal.\n* The Quorum threshold is defined by the minimum number of tokens that have voted in the proposal. \n    * The default quorum threshold is 30% of governance tokens in circulation. E.g. If we have 1000 total tokens in circulation, then we\u2019ll need 300 tokens to reach the quorum threshold.\n    * The DAO may propose different types of proposals that require a higher or lower threshold.\n    * The DAO may change the default quorum threshold.\n* A proposal may be re-proposed one time, subject to substantive differences in environment, market or circumstance.\n\n### Delegation\n\nThe DAO allows members to explicitly delegate their votes to another member and remove the delegation at any time for any reason.\n\n### Security\n\nFunds, assets and data must be secured by the DAO security team.

During the pre-public phase we are measuring health based on a set of parameters that are flexible to accommodate learning and incentive-based to encourage participation and propel development and growth. Health measurements will surely change as learning accelerates and membership expands. We cannot anticipate all problems, but the hope is that gaps in procedure will be filled through amendments (proposals).\n\n## DAO Health\n\nSince the thesis of CrisisDAO is that our hive-mind is superior to just one ape brain, our goal is to align the DAO members to a shared set of objectives and encourage participation in the activities to achieve key results. The KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are measurements we use to evaluate how the DAO is performing over time. The baseline KPIs include financials, member engagement, and proposals. The measurements will answer questions such as, how is the investment portfolio performing, what percentage of proposals are contributing to deal flow, and how many members are actively participating in voting. The indicators will be measured real-time, monthly or seasonally and will be accessible by all members. \n[Examples of the KPIs can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k1SonPuLyGwhzCTsgwvzcSsP68PeexjVzlYIkK-lHWk/edit#).\n\n### Knowledge Sharing\n\nTo accelerate the world\u2019s transition to equitable and just governance, we must document our stories and share them with the world. All of our documentations are [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) by default. Members are encouraged to share our stories via social media and conferences.\n\n### Epochs\n\nEpochs are a defined season of DAO operations. Epoch 1 is from now until 12/31/2021. For example: If by the end of 2021, we have lost money, we can sell and tax harvest our losses. If we have gains, we can propose taking the gains on 1/1 or continuing the DAO. \n\nThe DAO members will vote on the renewal of the DAO for one or more new Epochs before the end of each Epoch.\n", "choices": ["Yes, let's do it.
