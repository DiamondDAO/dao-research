{"id": "QmbzHpZQYRrGcGv1TM9FP55cyuAwLg7vn41BKBfazs82SV", "title": "Buy 50 SuperYeti NFTs", "body": "Presale just started for SuperYetis. These are super cute blind box 3D NFT characters that will be used in a game which will be released in early 2022. Presale began on June 7th and ends on June 15th when all the characters will be unveiled. Right now they are 0.1 ETH each, so we could buy 50 for 5 ETH. This is an original character, they seem to be following a lot of the best practices from Bored Apes and AxieInfinity and it seems likely to go up in value either immediately if FOMO kicks in this week or as the hype for the launch of the game gets closer. I propose buying 50 ASAP (today before they sell out) and then aim to sell 10-20 on the secondary market as it goes up to recoup the 5 ETH, and then hold the remaining Yetis until closer to game launch when demand will be significantly higher. \n\nI joined their Discord, people seem excited and the team seems engaged. I'm making this a relatively short vote time because I'm worried if people get excited they will sell out before we finish making the decision and ideally the DAO should be able to act fast.\n\nhttps://superyeti.co/", "choices": ["Yes, buy some Yetis!", "No way."], "start": 1623250800, "end": 1623268800, "snapshot": "12601178", "state": "closed", "author": "0xc93C7f71581DFEAAb59BEd908888dAC5689F312a", "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth", "name": "CrisisDAO"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVuKs3dLxnFGjXif4vb5rNuBsy88N4W3FcRtTp6Cjwnjv", "voter": "0x37990C085180528eF52F55C7945eBbc5bc040E50", "created": 1623266064, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQFHBSnbpgf3zMw6n7t7Czwgq46F1peq8HP476p3yHv8Q", "voter": "0x5D9B59eF830feCdeC7CBF5128CD288Ff7e66Da98", "created": 1623263884, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmabVzXYzHY8QoecgadMhexcYsTECHpM4ffHVMruNWLF2f", "voter": "0xBd277d616F747eC7a2bDC6CcE9d8fb69d5372453", "created": 1623262862, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS9AGxTqsq3mrTUedEwXkgdcfrxH9jRVsJuZX79hj7HHU", "voter": "0x7fb6F52996ba02884Fd4Cd136bB2af3D8909c56C", "created": 1623262400, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW8P58EuHoSu1R7fgy12yM1ptkmrBMq7MHEp8gZXsGkbw", "voter": "0xb3d89CE6002e17812adb8F7E5D7ec6CD7CB84C75", "created": 1623260464, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfJyme6fkp1KAePQEXavZ9UbQF1C9qwe6VoXpHkF9Kx8C", "voter": "0xe3F4F3aD70C1190EC480554bbc3Ed30285aE0610", "created": 1623260217, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeeP8PdcGaBAfUcK6G6dEXV6KPHuCLidywtA2atu4CbwN", "voter": "0xc1Acf33B71967ef68eA06e4008fb7ca0eEcd27eD", "created": 1623259650, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQYmCpr59KSwzAuPKvzmLAe3ySAA4vUQHAChfab4Dbs23", "voter": "0x4558e88C5a972244c995AE4DD95a84fc790355f9", "created": 1623259293, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU3sgQPhHuvUs5XSRbBpSUnjgLghJ1Ha3pJUk7s5HWymG", "voter": "0x0bF1F46866bcEF673Aa8Dc080a2409ff73B6718D", "created": 1623257704, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeyFQdB7Dx3yCh5H2bktGx9w1oKe8Aaw1JPshJUYKYe6D", "voter": "0xE7e84204B7e180454e5C40d0e04D346214a83f85", "created": 1623256490, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf7nQVURgpg7GcbQRWh7qKCn2AtMqBx4vLFeJ6SUy32C3", "voter": "0x961Aa96FebeE5465149a0787B03bFa14D8e9033F", "created": 1623254672, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma1LzgUoeVD4efJp1H7y43wPej2CTgTE8nggega9gi4SX", "voter": "0xc93C7f71581DFEAAb59BEd908888dAC5689F312a", "created": 1623254629, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}]}
