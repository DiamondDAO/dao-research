{"id": "QmbC26DFCYXz8Jof4yydtGrfLvtPZ7Kju69fzB5hBbVBNi", "title": "CrisisDAO Code of Conduct", "body": "\n\nMembers of the CrisisDAO are a global community. Our diversity of location, gender, age, and life experience is valuable within the DAO, and because of this, it takes honesty, respect, and kindness to work together.  The code of conduct is not a set of rules to be gamed or boxes to be checked. As an inclusive and open culture,  processes are in place to address issues as they arise.\n\nIn keeping with our open source ethos we have remixed aspects of the Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines (v3, https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/), the Open Humans Code of Conduct (201912) https://github.com/OpenHumans/open-humans/pull/1086/files \n\nThis Code of Conduct applies whenever you participate in CrisisDAO online and offline spaces including when you:\n* Participate in our online communication spaces, including Discord and other forums\n* Participate in DAO events and in-person spaces\n* Working with other DAO community members\n* Representing the DAO at public events\n* Speak on behalf of the DAO on social media\n\nIn CrisisDAO spaces all people are safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of: background, family status, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, race and/or ethnicity, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location and any other dimension of diversity.\n\nOpenness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work. Our community is a place for critical discussion and learning - where all subjects can be addressed, all critiques can be heard.  Learning will only take place if the environment is genuine, thoughtful, honest and kind.  That is why we insist that you:\n\nBe Courteous\nThe respect you receive is equal to what you give out, what you give yourself and the world around you. Value each other\u2019s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be courteous in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact on others and how intense interactions may be affecting people. \n \nBe constructive \nTake responsibility for how you come across and your mistakes \u2013 if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologise sincerely, and change your behaviour in future.\n\nBe Clear but Professional\nWe are likely to have some discussions about when criticism is respectful and when it\u2019s not. We must be able to speak clearly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don\u2019t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful. \nBe grateful for the opportunity to hear different perspectives from others. Even when you don't accept them, hear them out. We respect people even when we don\u2019t respect beliefs.\n\nBe Inclusive\nSeek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.\nBe inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people\u2019s participation whether they are remote (on video or phone); not native language speakers; from a different culture; in a different time zone or facing other challenges to participation. Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. \n\nChoose to be silent\nSometimes when we participate in conversations we feel the need to be silent, whether it is because we are becoming frustrated and don\u2019t want to say something we shouldn\u2019t or because the topic is sensitive for us. Tell others that you don\u2019t want to talk about that issue right now, or that the topic is personal and you aren\u2019t willing to discuss it. That is true for others too, so if someone communicates that they don\u2019t want to talk about something then respect their silence.\n\nBe Aware\nAsk yourself, how may my actions and words make other people feel for example, how will inappropriate nudity, out of control drunkeness, inappropriate physical contact and  sexual imagery, religious, racial, homophobic or cultural insults affect others? Be aware that others may have different attitudes on these issues and may not intend to cause offence. It may be necessary to make them aware how their behaviour affects you.\n\nDon\u2019t assume that everyone is like you. \n\nWhether your behaviour has caused someone else discomfort or their behaviour has caused you discomfort this is an opportunity for growth. Communicate clearly and respectfully, listen patiently, learn and grow as a person. \n \nUnderstand Different Perspectives\nOur goal should not be to \u201cwin\u201d every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. \u201cWinning\u201d is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.\nYou may not know the full story, listen.\n \nAppreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences\nWe come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others\u2019 needs from their point of view. Use preferred names and pronouns and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people\u2019s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself.\nLead by Example\nBy matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes.  Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors.\nBehavior That Will Not Be Tolerated\nThe following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.\nThe Code has set out the behaviour we expect. Obviously the converse is true. If it is not obvious to you that the behaviour we expect does not include threatening violence, doxxing or insulting people then you can\u2019t be part of our community. If your hurtful actions or words are a crime we may report them to the authorities. \n \nViolence and Threats of Violence\nViolence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people\u2019s personally identifying information (\u201cdoxxing\u201d) online.\n\nPersonal Attacks\nConflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.\n\nDerogatory Language\nHurtful or harmful language related to:\n* Background\n* Family status\n* Gender\n* Gender identity or expression\n* Marital status\n* Sex\n* Sexual orientation\n* Native language\n* Age\n* Ability\n* Race and/or ethnicity\n* Caste\n* National origin\n* Socioeconomic status\n* Religion\n* Geographic location\n* Other attributes\n* Diet/Vegan \nis not acceptable.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure if a word is derogatory, don\u2019t use it. When asked to stop, stop the behaviour in question.\n\nUnwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact\nUnwelcome sexual attention and unwelcome physical contact are not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. This includes touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos. This also includes physically blocking or intimidating another person. Physical contact or simulated physical contact without affirmative consent is not acceptable. This includes sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text.\n\nYou are entitled to tell other people when their attention or behaviour makes you uncomfortable.\n\nDisruptive Behaviour\nSustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes:\n* \u2018Talking over\u2019 or \u2018heckling\u2019 speakers.\n* Drinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs to excess, or pushing others to do so.\n* Making derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol or other substances, pushing people to drink, talking about their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to drink - physically or through jeering. \n* Commenting negatively about other people\u2019s choices\n* Inappropriate nudity\n* Disparaging people\u2019s dietary preferences\n* Discriminating against vegans and other philosophical, religious beliefs \n* Influencing Unacceptable Behaviour\n\nWe will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way we treat the activities themselves, and thus the same consequences apply.\n\nModification \nAs with all things open source this is a work in progress. We will revisit it from time to time. When we do, the new code will apply to all DAO spaces.\n\n\n---\n", "choices": ["Approved", "NOT approved", "Abstain"], "start": 1628074800, "end": 1628334000, "snapshot": "12959114", "state": "closed", "author": "0x8938C6507D9739b0F6B0B49CfdEF2D8377470aB0", "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth", "name": "CrisisDAO"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmeAdLYNtFuMZ5JF6ypFqhRr6zk2ARFc2oPtFViJXmBU2B", "voter": "0xDF318c14c0C335798aC7F7601503b75f8Fcb873D", "created": 1628267138, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSHSS962HPzdpiHh9RMkHAkGEUU86degKVBbaBJZK7dtt", "voter": "0xE7e84204B7e180454e5C40d0e04D346214a83f85", "created": 1628218790, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUSyiXHrPATNJnjn2UCi88PPWWdb9TaQbTYTA1y9fu5NE", "voter": "0x0bF1F46866bcEF673Aa8Dc080a2409ff73B6718D", "created": 1628156869, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZqrvtB3YEmcp9DD8yDXXQfwMegEcSVFYcaiNKV5tCn4r", "voter": "0xa62f4152954c3CFbe762932512dB35F40517507b", "created": 1628113612, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcHjXPrdt8mK2TreeoeTpCoaQXnk7DWuChXuMLuyYCDkY", "voter": "0x4558e88C5a972244c995AE4DD95a84fc790355f9", "created": 1628109159, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPkxQiW9NbiHAc7WyY7bzTE5AF36oe222HBebXzbFb9Ho", "voter": "0xc93C7f71581DFEAAb59BEd908888dAC5689F312a", "created": 1628096586, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSKomPB4YAQouUNftthLSKhaFvBFm85mmjU1mmUToXBQH", "voter": "0xBd277d616F747eC7a2bDC6CcE9d8fb69d5372453", "created": 1628094701, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmdxw7HyutyUecVWasTP2kM9Sg9zSxYJs4dRQ4494RQB9T", "voter": "0x37990C085180528eF52F55C7945eBbc5bc040E50", "created": 1628094156, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRUJqvbCYpSC3pFJtTPEewz9fJgw3PqymFXNXWZZsttU4", "voter": "0xc1Acf33B71967ef68eA06e4008fb7ca0eEcd27eD", "created": 1628091911, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNdFwQ5FJHcL5hj1eNgXhcyWU75YjS4sP6uJeewGWxHwG", "voter": "0x8938C6507D9739b0F6B0B49CfdEF2D8377470aB0", "created": 1628088027, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}]}
