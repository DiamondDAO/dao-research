CrisisDAO Members are people with families and friends, and may have businesses, professions, investments, property interests, and other connections to different communities.\n\nWhen any Member is placed in a situation that they may have a financial interest, personal activity or relationship that could impair their ability to act impartially and in the best interest of the DAO, report their conflict to the Membership Team and must recuse themselves from voting.\n\nIf any Member believes another Member has a conflict of interest, this should be discussed with the Member in question.  If both members are not able to decide if a conflict may occur, they are to discuss with the Membership Team.\n\nConflicts of interest should be documented publicly on the Discord by the Membership Team.\n\n\nConflict of personality:\n\nWhen someone contravenes the Code of Conduct, offends or makes a member uncomfortable, this is the process that we follow. \n\nIf you are offended or uncomfortable and able to do so then please start off by talking to the person who has offended you, preferably in a non threatening environment that you feel most uncomfortable in, be it public or private. Explain to them how what they said or did offended you and that it is inappropriate in our community. \n\nIf you don\u2019t feel able to speak to someone alone then ask someone else from the community to be present in the conversation. Don\u2019t know who to ask? Then ask one of the Membership team, if the problem is with one of the Membership team then ask the Operations team.\n\nIf someone approaches you and tells you that something you have done or said is offensive then listen to them. Try to understand their point of view. It is easy to feel offended or defensive at this point but most people really appreciate an honest attempt to listen and understand. We believe that you will come to an understanding. \n\nYou may not feel able to speak directly to the person who has offended you even with someone else present. Perhaps you feel there is a power imbalance or something else inhibiting dialogue. If so then speak to the Membership team about the problem. The Membership team will probably ask to meet with both you and the other person to discuss the issue. If you agree to meet with the other person then you can also have someone from the community to support you in the meeting. The Membership team may also bring in others as they feel is appropriate.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to meet with the person the Membership team may meet with them and then again with you to see what resolution may be reached.\n\nIf someone refuses to behave in an appropriate way then that person may be excluded from CrisisDAO convened spaces. The Membership Team will define the steps that will be taken.  The steps will always involve communication, learning and a calm phased, appropriate approach. If that happens then the CrisisDAO may choose to speak publicly about it if that seems appropriate but it certainly doesn\u2019t have to do so.\n\nThis is a process. It takes time. Be patient.\n\nIt is not appropriate to first air your grievances on social media. In the same way it is not appropriate to complain publicly about people without first following the process. If you do so then you may make it difficult or impossible for our process to operate through eroding trust.\n\nA note on conflict:\n\nConflict gives us an opportunity to learn and grow.  We should all aim to examine our own actions and reactions in the spirit of generosity, good will and evolution. \n\nModification \n\nAs with all things open source this is a work in progress. We will revisit it from time to time. When we do, the new code will apply to all CrisisDAO spaces.\n\n", "choices": ["Approved", "NOT approved", "Abstain"], "start": 1628074800, "end": 1628334000, "snapshot": "12959245", "state": "closed", "author": "0x8938C6507D9739b0F6B0B49CfdEF2D8377470aB0", "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth", "name": "CrisisDAO"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZewCtCe5Pu9CPi6Mu1n7Urr7SPw3HEy1AHJq5tMMENGU", "voter": "0xDF318c14c0C335798aC7F7601503b75f8Fcb873D", "created": 1628267184, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYYTCrFkV5GtTV2A8QQvzvVRXmduBzr1JtmH8RiEuJ7HM", "voter": "0x0bF1F46866bcEF673Aa8Dc080a2409ff73B6718D", "created": 1628157010, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeoUmXsrpnDuv2tYKsGRfKbbDNos5HQuDKxANk7jUciFe", "voter": "0xb3d89CE6002e17812adb8F7E5D7ec6CD7CB84C75", "created": 1628117547, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcSogdZmjxfWxQFA3LZFTvU9PEVCTKVNv8yLi6StkEUXs", "voter": "0xa62f4152954c3CFbe762932512dB35F40517507b", "created": 1628113879, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPgrXZLZw8TyZE5uVesymvAd1K3prKcDETRx1DSR5WWVb", "voter": "0x4558e88C5a972244c995AE4DD95a84fc790355f9", "created": 1628108958, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdVxa5ZAEZHYfEfxKyqM3gHHgPPCKw8vE4aP5aG3oNB8Z", "voter": "0xE7e84204B7e180454e5C40d0e04D346214a83f85", "created": 1628098514, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmedw68jNqkcr6p71EZAKyheYNkQ37RoiFrCFBoELMHFEu", "voter": "0xc93C7f71581DFEAAb59BEd908888dAC5689F312a", "created": 1628096487, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY6z6mZWFToctxMeuWPQWrkrpn1t7VdYWjcKzEd5vVZFU", "voter": "0xBd277d616F747eC7a2bDC6CcE9d8fb69d5372453", "created": 1628094634, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS1SNp13LGxqNnEhHxpYjSCuQCGYHEBBQSRew47Xts6b7", "voter": "0x37990C085180528eF52F55C7945eBbc5bc040E50", "created": 1628094120, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeDMfptAaqNVTSQbvYs8KTtuksTXrYUurjvCWDb4o1ccb", "voter": "0xc1Acf33B71967ef68eA06e4008fb7ca0eEcd27eD", "created": 1628091886, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZR5RB7pLMY24ecymWFxYMuQ1gLNubEXr1akVv3TuvRzz", "voter": "0x8938C6507D9739b0F6B0B49CfdEF2D8377470aB0", "created": 1628088234, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crisisdao.eth"}}]}
