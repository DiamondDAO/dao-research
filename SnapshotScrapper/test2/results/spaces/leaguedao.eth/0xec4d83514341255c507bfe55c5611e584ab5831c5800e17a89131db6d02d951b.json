This stands to benefit the community members that took part in this first mint and ended up with players that stand little to no chance to score any points in the league.\n\nIf a player meets the eligibility criteria, which will be based on the total number of snaps played. We are specifically limiting this to the practice squad level players that don't actually play each week.The minter can opt-in to swap their player token for 300 DAI. \n\nThe core team will use the DAI that went to the \ntreasury from the sale of Player Tokens to buy back players for the same price as the mint.  This gives the minter the chance to  mint a new player token. \n\nCurrent DAI in DAO Treasury from 20% of Nomo Token Sales: 62,760\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nBuyback Timing: \nStart: Friday 11/19, 5:00 PM EST\nEnd: Tuesday 11/23, 5:00 PM EST\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nEligibility Rules:\n- 764 players with the lowest total number of snaps played for the 2021 season, to date. *Means they played under 40 total snaps this season. \n- Players on the Injured Reserve (IR) are not eligible if they do not meet the snap count criteria. \n- Buyback will continue until the DAI in the wallet is gone or we hit the deadline. Whichever comes first. \n- First come, first serve. \n\nSteps:\n1. Check if your players are eligible\n2. Submit your Player Tokens ID# and your wallet address in a new ticket via the discord Support Bot. #\ud83d\udcddfeature-requests \n3. We will confirm that the player is eligible\n4.
