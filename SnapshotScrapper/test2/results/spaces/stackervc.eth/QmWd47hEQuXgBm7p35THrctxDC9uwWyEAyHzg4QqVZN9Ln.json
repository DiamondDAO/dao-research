This will likely (though specs are not final) include at a minimum:\n\n- Time-lock voting boost\n- DAO tier-based boost\n- Fee distribution from funds to STACK holders\n- A way to get more STACK for holding STACK over the long-term\n\n#### I propose that 50% of Fund 1\u2019s management fee be distributed over the course of the next year through the upcoming STACK Vault in the form of 50% ETH and 50% STACK (with STACK bought back off the market).\n\n# Better Tokenomics\n\nAt the moment, STACK is strictly a governance token. With around $20 million in TVL, it is time to give STACK greater utility. \n\nStreaming a portion of fund management fees to STACK holders who stake their tokens, both in the underlying currencies and in more STACK tokens, provides long-term DAO participants with the following benefits:\n\n- Compounding ownership of the DAO (More STACK for staking STACK)\n- A share in the success of Stacker Ventures current and future funds (Revenue)\n- A greater voice for committing to participate over the long-term (Time-locked vote boosting)\n- Another reason to upgrade to the next DAO tier, and thus more Due Diligence Committee participants (Tier boost)\n\n# Rewarding DAO Participants (STACK Holders)\n\nDAO members should be rewarded for participating in DAO governance. This would provide a simple way of giving back to the Due Diligence Committee and StackPack members for their contributions to the DAO through a built-in STACK Vault tier boost. We are also actively exploring new ways of adding value to each of these tiers and welcome all suggestions!\n\n# Benefits to Fund 1 and SVC001 Holders\n\nFund 1 owns a significant portion of the STACK token supply (50,000 STACK tokens). As a large stakeholder in the success of the STACK token, Fund 1 will benefit from less STACK on the market.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1620661500, "end": 1620877500, "snapshot": "12407407", "state": "closed", "author": "0xC77c0e37cA5EC76d25C853F7e8D71E6C535d8048", "space": {"id": "stackervc.eth", "name": "Stacker Ventures"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
