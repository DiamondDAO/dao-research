Raiders are available and want to work on the proposed project\nb. The client can pay us in crypto\n\nIf the answer is Yes, then the Guild will accept work from web2 clients, and raiders on those raids will contribute spoils back to the Guild as with any other raid.\n\nIf the answer is No, then individual Guild members are free to independently contract with the client, with no requirement to contribute spoils back to the Guild.", "choices": ["Yes, we should accept web2 client work", "No, web3 or die"], "start": 1601661600, "end": 1601960400, "snapshot": "11061602", "state": "closed", "author": "0x15C6AC4Cf1b5E49c44332Fb0a1043Ccab19db80a", "space": {"id": "raid-guild", "name": "Raid Guild"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
