{"id": "QmXZ9xcGFBVmSPwqBxYzFMSdeWyvr85FrLtxbXbiR7HxLx", "title": "Proposal to Whitelist CoTrader ", "body": "# COT/BNT Pool Info\n\nThe COTBNT pool is already often #1 in APR fees for any token with significant liquidity, especially for a small cap ($4M today). It's recently had over 300% APR from fees, with over $10K liquidity. Even with 3% fees, Bancor may still be the best place to trade it if we (the project) concentrate high liquidity there as follows: \n\nThe pool's liquidity (and volume fees for APR) may greatly increase once CoTrader begin its own upcoming COT LM rewards program, on Bancor (instead of e.g. Uniswap). BNT would benefit just as much from CoTrader incentivizing with COT, since its pools are 1/2 BNT. CoTrader may gain large LD as it's a far more developed project than many quick launches that get $3-6M+ liquidity on various DEXs recently.\n\nIf there were LM rewards for COTBNT, miners could earn both LM rewards AND the already great APR fee earnings.\n\n# COT/BNT pool, Etherscan link:\nhttps://etherscan.io/token/0x19db077a54dea3fd4cbcd9d31d4db297562cbd9\n\n# COT token, Etherscan link:\nhttps://etherscan.io/token/0x5c872500c00565505f3624ab435c222e558e9ff\n\n# CoTrader Summary\n\nCoTrader.com was the first live DeFi investment funds on Ethereum mainnet since 2018. \n\nCoTrader fund managers can manage investor assets without holding them. Investors can withdraw from \"smart funds\" anytime, with proof of past ROI and performance fees automatically as trades happen via DEX, pools, and other defi dapps. \n\nCoTrader was one the first 2 companies to ever receive a Bancor grant, to build bancor.cotrader.com\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nCOT utility isn't tied to some promise to use the token in businesses offchain. Rather, its tied to onchain buy-back mechanisms integrated into its smart contracts - its smart funds platform. The COT token is tied to fund performance. Fund managers can set eg 20% as a performance fee. COT token buy-back is then done with 75% of 20% of that 20%, or 3%. 50% of the buy back is burned by sending to 0x0, 25% goes to a 51% voted platform admin, and 25% goes to a bond staking reserve. There are 20B tokens max, with over 18.886B already in circulation.\n\n# Holders\n\nCoTrader has over 50,000 holders, although, admittedly, most of them are from a (very successful) bounty program telegram bot that had over 70,000 people join and follow channels, like, retweet etc.  Most of these were real people, and we tried to prevent bots with various measures.\n\nCoTrader's more significant holders work in blockchain VCs and are seasoned fund managers. Others are not very active traders in crypto, and are holding for the very long run. This latter group liked the idea of someone doing their crypto investing for them. Newers holders are more active traders and DeFi users. \n\n# Total Locked Value (TLV) & AUM potential\n\nTLV is a DeFi KPI, and in our case, amounts to Assets Under Management (AUM). A few large AUM funds are considering using CoTrader, as we approach a market-fitting product. At our current market cap and Total Locked Value (TLV), picking up some of these would be very significant news, and may greatly affect our platform and token prospects.\n\n# Code\n\n8 version iterations of CoTrader's smart contracts are open source on GitHub, where you'll also find Bancor portal work from its grant.\n\nOver $30,000 TLV already sits inside its smart funds as navigable onsite.\n\nhttps://github.com/CoTraderCore\n\n# Audit status\n\nDue to the frequency of updates, the contract has not yet been formally audited. However, the token is a standard erc20 with a fixed supply. The team is committing to an open bounty program, the code is open source, and available on the Cotrader Github page. There have not been any hacks or exploits on the platform. \n\n# Insurance tiers\n\nAs a small market cap coin, this proposal concedes certain modifications are necessary to circumvent possible exploits, inflation, and other unwanted behaviour. We propose that the impermanent loss insurance schedule remain unmodified (i.e. 30% coverage after 30 days, and 100% after 100 days); however, the maximum co-investment from the protocol should not exceed 10,000 BNT (a 99% drop compared to large market cap assets and stablecoins). The small minting limit bottlenecks the single-sided liquidity opportunity for COT holders, thereby encouraging dedicated LPs to purchase and deposit their own BNT in the protocol to support the pool. Moreover, the high APR should also attract additional BNT from outside the COT community, from those BNT holders in pursuit of the highest possible yields. Therefore the 10,000 BNT minting cap presents a low inflation risk, without sacrificing too much opportunity.\n\n# Product View\n\n![image|444x500](upload://AhYoMS3lJ5y5wWkmCYWs25bYVsX.png) \n\n# Bancor/CoTrader business model alignment\n\nCoTrader's biz model is aligned with Bancor: We are planning to add a flagship fund for Bancor LM for the existing whitelisted tokens, and possibly for new projects' LM rewards projects.\n\nAs Bancor's unique BNT token model benefits equally (in 50/50 balance) by others projects' liquidity via e.g. their own LM programs, this Bancor voting DAO can be a natural symbiotic partner and important hub that may vet projects via Whitelisting\n\nWe believe this may kickstart a trend for projects to do their LM rewards launches on Bancor, where there are more benefits.\n\n# Social\n\nSocial channels have many 10,000s of followers, but again, mostly from the old bounty programs.\n\nTwitter has over 35k+ followers\ntwitter.com/cotrader_com\n\nFB has over 38k+ followers\nfacebook.com/ cotrader\n\nTelegram has over 8k\nhttps://t.me/cotrader\nNews channel over 4k\nhttps://t.me/cotraders\n\n\n# Market info\n\nCMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cotrader\nMessari: https://messari.io/asset/cotrader\nCG: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cotrader\n1inch: https://1inch.exchange/#/ETH/COT\n\n# CMC key info\n\n**COT ROI at 229%** \n(Nov 25 2020, 8:32pm PST)\n\n![image|285x500](upload://sfyD8F67m8YaKiY1tuQ14YkGjAj.png)\n\n# Product Videos:\n\nGary Bernstein (Founder) explains at major blockchain event in LA, Crypto Invest Summit 2018\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU9tdC8sdO8\n\n# Harvard Campus Speaker\n\"The Current State of Cryptocurrency Hedge Funds Part 2\":\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iS1lgXbfWE&t=32m15s\n\n# Custom product video:\n(2018.
