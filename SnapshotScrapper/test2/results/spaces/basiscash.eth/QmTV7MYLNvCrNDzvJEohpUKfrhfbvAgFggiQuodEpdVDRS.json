I am really happy and excited about giving my best to managing our community on Telegram, running Vietnamese community, and supporting our members in the Discord server.\n\nIn every project, users need to be informed about new updates, how to use, how to participate etc, and when they have a problem, they need support from the team as soon as possible. For most projects, new users always reach to teams on Telegram Group first. So, a well-managed Telegram Group is important for the team to support and connect with current users as well as potential users. If appointed, I will make Basis Cash Telegram Group the best managed group in the crypto space.\n\nResponsibilities/Deliverables:\n- Moderate Basis Cash Global group chat, Basis Cash Announcements Channel. We are currently at more than 4700 members on TG group chat, and as you know, I am managing this group myself 24/7 since the end of December 2020. \n- Support the team to connect and expand Basis Cash\u2019s recognition in other crypto communities globally and in Vietnam. We currently partner with Coin98 Wallet, and their users can directly connect to our app, and they will support us for marketing on their platform for free. This partnership will help us to attract more users not just from Vietnam but globally as Coin98 Wallet has more than 150k users worldwide.\n- Support and execute Basis Cash marketing campaigns to attract more users.\n- Support our community members on Basis Cash Discord Server, as what I am doing now. Maybe you have noticed Mr_Dao everywhere on Discord :blush: \n- Translate and publish Basis Cash content, updates, BIP, CDIP, AMA recap, guides\u2026 on Medium.\n- Run Vietnamese Basis Cash community, start with Telegram, then will expand by making content on Youtube, personal website and other social platform;\n- Run Vietnamese content for Basis Cash on Coin98.net, one of the largest crypto community in Vietnam.\n\nAbout Me\nI\u2019m 31, from Vietnam, an Automobile Engineer. After 6 years working as a lecturer at a University, I have quit my job to work for a crypto information platform in Vietnam. I have been leading one team for 3 years in researching and providing crypto information for a Vietnamese hodlers group. My jobs were:\n- Training newbie;\n- Researching crypto projects and following their progression then updates for group members;\n- Product contents about: new, research, guides, opinion, strategies\u2026\n- And also, I have been investing and holding some coins, and you know, the result is great now.\n\nWhy Hire Me?\nI love Basis Cash, so I eat, sleep, work with Basis Cash all day from the moment I know about Basis Cash. I will give my best to Basis Cash Community, and I will spread this \u201clove\u201d to every one. I believe that I have already shown this \u201clove\u201d and my commitment to Basis Cash as a volunteer for about 2 months.\nTogether, we will make Basis Cash vision come true. \nThank you for your consideration.\n\nNote from @\u97e6\u6069-Wayne:\nI would like to thank @Morty, @yyctrader and the team for the trust and support during last couple of months. It's your creativity and capability that drew me to Basis Cash in the first place.\n\nMore importantly, I want to show appreciation to the Basis Cash community, the enthusiasm and encouragement from each and everyone of you makes me believe the vision and mission of Basis Cash.

I will use a portion of my compensation to do this.\n- Further build up Asia Pacific communities, especially Japan and Korea.\n- More collaboration with Asia Pacific DeFi world.\n\nNone of this would be possible without the support from our team and community, thank you again and wish all of you a happy and successful year of Ox!\n\nThis snapshot vote has been proposed after a successful Discord vote:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/784481893482758184/784486816266715176/815320868019634226\n\nBoth candidates will be hired effective 1 March 2021 if this snapshot passes.\n", "choices": ["Hire Mr_Dao and Wayne", "Do Nothing"], "start": 1614553200, "end": 1614639600, "snapshot": "11948650", "state": "closed", "author": "0x0819915F548E3b635af0d715a46eBc982650550c", "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth", "name": "BasisCash"}, "votes": 19, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYzmZrWpgvfUFpnkyH7GLd41XdPnnpFCWpPyW972JTPtv", "voter": "0xF79442452a9943908010B4a00C97b51C45302B92", "created": 1614623528, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYyvAYSPaDyPdfJoYQ5vNtBQjbjBQ3MSZidJPzQ56YC9N", "voter": "0x5047C5398009249Fa4ceBa72Ea706F82eea20649", "created": 1614617526, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXTw96QdsdVKyWJPpdUpnrXpnnqNnnjkDGXZFgp1WeAZT", "voter": "0xb8d33B3e0f964230f6Da772bF2dB4873e66e3ffB", "created": 1614606901, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZRHvSn69b6xp3MvbZuZbmx44yWD5onuxYLt8dk3wcuWC", "voter": "0xF569914d4E46cBD6A91fDE6c8850a079604A271b", "created": 1614605817, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS2kTxSDrEdxdM98XjRMmSLr2uNvmimAY4H8kwE1237gQ", "voter": "0x92cdc01e5Ecb39b0F5f225a48E7d450C0F4B708F", "created": 1614600532, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUf9MnPDVcTNdKdxuzJuuH1uybtZganbvNcJudad16fmm", "voter": "0x0Bebe2165De412E7925Ab8352E36f3B0493dD3b9", "created": 1614598597, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNaQJQ5XMMdy4EWefYkg6tmhST7SVeWejQPc8yRNvf73z", "voter": "0x5C559f816695ab19E727aD6e5F0A31a6B95EFb5F", "created": 1614589668, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmai79LThizMiwYXi5tSiqRJiqwn1wy2AGm4kVPL7eepvA", "voter": "0xB02DC63B4e234e1aBc36EAD88DF610d67f4920dD", "created": 1614586712, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRhSB4pB9WT1oGreAd7LW2kcq6a7C7bq1Cqwqg15RA9Ay", "voter": "0x32EAc51F54C02502415A89c34Bd7D1bCE345DAAE", "created": 1614586091, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWrqSyt37gcSBX9DpwieEA1xauLpE5TX6vxvz7jyAoAkw", "voter": "0xa1Ae13999DF5740B709af82A727980C113A2527f", "created": 1614577117, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWDGfWufVCj1S2CpNf2q74H9Cg86qTopW3eiUwUAEbR69", "voter": "0x7D9F9EAeB48E994eda2fA151b8581154cF0719F7", "created": 1614574454, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRQwGZSdNHbzZ7vLHG82UWTHbGH1f6nWuT419wcd4scAC", "voter": "0xE0BFAC3995BF5C6BB7e921330023bbd8a681C67E", "created": 1614570444, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbgjbYdetvZrcSzhJtdHSYwvL2VtSKbfpBRm2R9wsy3if", "voter": "0x378B4B8c3d2F7951B22874A30b9D1C252203AFA5", "created": 1614568615, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNRXDjVKJFuMqYNZJNDoLSpPQ2zAPzonPZWy9CgVoVKMg", "voter": "0xeA85D664DA448Bc57b93d7DFAEcBEE1d57B93CD8", "created": 1614567163, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQRqUGAUweKk3oggcBEKsYSh1KWrBDyFtjLXmYpFzeKBV", "voter": "0x7bdBC445eb18c93e86a22412De333229cFb5Cd39", "created": 1614563546, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc9PnTFpQzjYc7gtNLzoexVskh7eNZDnn7Q2Tn2wGKzQY", "voter": "0xdebccc195e08Ab253ea31917DefFBF5121b1cE3A", "created": 1614562678, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbk7a5a17eczTxmDq7MUvwgQ2xBqnXnLUxmWJvLWCXuWB", "voter": "0xBD1f7d88C76A86C60d41bDDD4819fAe404e7151E", "created": 1614561484, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ2JDSnTbKFNufFRk1bJJW73Evn46bFaZxFXwMoCXcWfx", "voter": "0xbbD78233f019E3774bAA601B613ceA31bBddD4bf", "created": 1614561127, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaYMcYy3AR43KKbMZyMqUueq2Qp48RMVaErBef1jGzF9c", "voter": "0x5c4D8CEE7dE74E31cE69E76276d862180545c307", "created": 1614554755, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basiscash.eth"}}]}
