It has been exactly 1 month since the launch and we have conquered amazing things during the past 1 month. Without our marvelous community, this project wouldn't succeed. \n\nLast week, I proposed @yyctrader to join basis cash core team as a Marketing Lead. What he has shown without any compensation proves him to be an eligible team member. I want every community member to welcome @yyctrader with warm heart. \n\nProposed Compensation: \nBase Salary : US$ 8K/month, paid in BAC on the 1st of the month.\nVested Compensation: US$ 2K/month of BAS is market bought and staked in the Boardroom for 1 year.\nTotal compensation: $120K/year.\nOverall cost to the CDF: $10K per month.\n\nNote from @yyctrader:\n\nFirst off, I'd like to thank @Morty and the team for the trust I've been given to manage this Discord with minimal supervision and full cooperation. I've really enjoyed helping to build this community from the ground up.\n\nAs DeFi matures, Basis Cash must consistently innovate on behalf of our users while user demand for new requirements and services outside of the traditional Moderator structure continues to grow exponentially. There are many levels of internal experience and expertise within the community that can be leveraged to produce mutually beneficial improvements in operations, deployment, scaling/capacity planning, protocol and media relations, security, and the overall user experience. There is a clear need and opportunity for a single Point of Contact to manage the operations of these multiple services spread across the globe, which can increase scalability, improve communication and visibility between teams and users of the protocol, and optimize future earnings for all holders. I believe I can fill that role.\n\nAs our TVL and BAS price continue to rise, we risk getting complacent. I\u2019ve seen many projects stagnate and die, mainly due to a lack of focus on marketing and keeping the community engaged after the initial hype phase. If appointed, I will make it my mission to ensure that this does not happen here.\n\nResponsibilities/Deliverables:\n-    Create a formal marketing structure, with community members being incentivized to maximise our global outreach. Marketing budget to be devised for community approval.\n-    Manage the official Basis Twitter and other social media accounts\n-    Weekly/Fortnightly newsletter based on amount of content available.\n-    Make our Discord the best in DeFi. I think we have built a great community, and must be careful not to lose that as our numbers grow. We\u2019re currently at just under 2000 members and growing quickly. The Mod team and anti-spam efforts will be beefed up. Ideas to drive and maintain engagement include contests and giveaways (tasteful ones, not shill spam)\n-    Integrations \u2013 I would like us to target a minimum of one new integration a month. I will go forth in the DeFi world with hat in hand to try and make it happen. All community ideas will be vetted and explored.\n-    Liaise with the usual websites CG, CMC, Defipulse etc to ensure that our info is always up-to-date.\n-    Community Fund \u2013 expenses to be tracked and posted in #CDF-txs\n\nTLDR: Beyond marketing, I envision this role as being the eyes and ears of the dev team in the community, to make sure that all ideas are heard, vetted, and executed if deemed beneficial to the Basis ecosystem that we are trying to build.\n\nAbout Me\nI\u2019m 35, an engineer by training who defected to the dark side of capitalism. After obtaining my CFA charter, I worked in banking, doing stints in corporate finance, treasury operations and finally asset management. I got bored of the corporate life and started a small fund (non-crypto related) and have been trading full-time for the last 10 years. While I don\u2019t have formal marketing experience, I have led and managed marketing teams in the past for various targeted campaigns.\n\nMy Crypto Journey\nMy first crypto purchase was ETH in 2017 at 500 CAD. I rode it up to 1500, sold, and proceeded to lose it all in the ICO craze. I stayed away until this summer, when I was lured back by high yields on stablecoins. I was blissfully ignorant of DeFi and happy with my 10% yield at Celsius until I came across Pickle, and was immediately hooked. The rest is history\u2026\n\nWhy Hire Me?\nI\u2019m driven by results and thrive in high-pressure situations. Once I sink my teeth into a project, I give it my all (as proof of this, you can visit the Pickle governance forum and peruse my litany of proposals).\n\nI believe that I have already shown my commitment to Basis Cash as a volunteer, and truly believe that I can add value and help us realize our vision of Basis Cash \u2013 One Stablecoin to Rule Them All!\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nI wish you and your families a very Happy New Year!\n\nThis snapshot vote has been proposed after a successful Discord
