This proposal ratifies the first step on this journey and executes the first step in agreeing and implementing tokenomics for Gro DAO Token.\n\nYou can read more about Gro\u2019s approach to decentralisation here: [link to Medium article/twitter].\n\nPROPOSAL SUMMARY\n\nIf executed, this proposal will:\n1. Ratify the deployment of the Gro DAO Token (GRO).\n2. Agree proposed GRO tokenomics including minting 5m GRO to the Gro Dao treasury.\n3. Give Distributer contract permissions to mint future GRO in order to execute the proposed tokenomics.\n\nPROPOSAL BACKGROUND\n\nCurrently the Gro DAO can vote using xGRO as a temporary non-transferable ERC20 voting token that is minted to users of the protocol, investors and team. \n\nRatifying the deployment of GRO this is the first step in a journey to wider decentralisation. \n\nGRO is proposed to be distributed over the coming years in accordance with the tokenomics set out in this snapshot vote and shared with the community previously.\n\nGRO DAO TOKEN SPECIFICATIONS\n\n* Token name: Gro DAO Token\n* Token symbol: GRO\n* Contract address: 0x3Ec8798B81485A254928B70CDA1cf0A2BB0B74D7\n* Max supply: 100m\n* Decimal places: 18\n\nPROPOSED TOKENOMICS FOR GRO\n\n* 45% of the tokens will be allocated for liquidity mining programs and community engagement activities, including at least 1% specifically for airdrops\n* 13% will go to the GRO DAO Treasury to be used for grants and the ongoing operations of the protocol, including the 5% (5mn) minted for the initial Gro DAO treasury\n* 19.5% will go to early seed investors\n* 22.5% will go to the team behind Gro protocol and core contributors\n* Team, Advisor and Seed Investor vesting: 3 year vest with 1 year cliff\n* Inflation: Hard-coded at 0% during the first 3 years, then continues at 0% unless GRO token holders vote to change (can be changed after three years to a maximum of 5%)\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF TOKENOMICS\n\nThis proposal starts to implement the tokenomics set out above by setting the permissions to mint future GRO. These permissions will be given to the Distributer contract (0x54ACB7E67186F6b71a10C3b5102b16A6060877C3).\n\nThe distributor contract includes immutable limits in line with the tokenomics set out above.\n\nHOW WAS THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSED?\n\nThis proposal was put together by early contributors behind the Gro protocol, in line with the early governance plans for Gro DAO [LINK TO MEDIUM ARTICLE].\n\nAfter the successful wider launch of the Gro token, all proposals will be discussed openly and developed through the formal governance process. This process is meant to be owned and developed collectively by the Gro community.", "choices": ["Support Proposal", "Reject Proposal"], "start": 1632222000, "end": 1632225600, "snapshot": "9330769", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6523F418c4b7260b070A17C47A206b66935D67cd", "space": {"id": "vote-rinkeby.gro.xyz", "name": "Gro rinkeby governance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
