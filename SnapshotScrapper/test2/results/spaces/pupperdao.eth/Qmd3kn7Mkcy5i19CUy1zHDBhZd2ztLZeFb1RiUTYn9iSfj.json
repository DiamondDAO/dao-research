I have been writing music all my life for pleasure, but have recently started an NFT Music Twitter page.  I have already provided a handful of tracks for an existing defi company, and it was incredibly fun.  I've been with Pupper since the beginning and love the community and the people in it.  I'd like to provide a service to it in some way shape or form if I can.  Analog NFT would like to write a handful of tracks / published NFTS for Pupper.  They can be used on the website, in the background white staking and managing assets, or however the community sees fit.  My hope is this will bring life to our environment and welcome new investors.  I would like to propose we set aside 5 Billion Pupperoni from the treasury / deli to facilitate this service.  Multiple tracks will be provided, and perhaps one can be voted on via Discord to be picked as the main theme to make it a community driven activity.  Any comments or thematically related suggestions are welcome!  Contacts are below.\n\nTwitter: Analog NFTs @nft_beats\n\nDiscord: @Crypto_Fluency", "choices": ["Yes to a Pupper theme!
