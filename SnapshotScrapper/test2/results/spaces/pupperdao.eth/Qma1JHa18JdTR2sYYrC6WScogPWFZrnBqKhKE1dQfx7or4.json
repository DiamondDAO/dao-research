Accordingly, we'd like to promote the drip.\n\nAfter speaking with some folks who have worked on other NFT marketing campaigns (as well as traditional paid ads), the best bang-for-our-buck appears to be sponsored influencer posts on **Twitter**. Here are a few of the reasons:\n\n1) **Audience**: Folks who are most likely to buy or accumulate NFTs, live on Twitter. Plain and simple.\n2) **Cost**: Posts typically run $100-$750 through influencers with between 50,00-150,000 followers, and have much stronger engagement than on-page takeovers (4chan, etc.).\n3) **Ease**: It's much easier to run an ad campaign through influencers as we can pay them directly from the Pupper Treasury, as opposed to a credit card on a website.\n\n**Proposal: We allocate up to $2000.00 from the Pupper Treasury to be spent on paid posts building one week up to our NFT drop.**\n\nFeel free to add on to the growing list of influencers (along with their post pricing) here: https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invL6JiSsSfoNlQB7&inviteToken=b277e96e2797454fabd27a4be6ac82c4ccd4b89785ffb777b8df3b39b55c78ba&utm_source=email\n\n", "choices": ["YES", "No"], "start": 1632361500, "end": 1632527100, "snapshot": "13278713", "state": "closed", "author": "0x056c57efB4a6e45B4242933Cc46dF7d69676537E", "space": {"id": "pupperdao.eth", "name": "PupperDAO"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPnAD1AcbkZocsQBqkBE7GHBhCRPBXHpJsBfGK42zSpbQ", "voter": "0x050920eDA4014e25DED17c346b425239a468d63d", "created": 1632412603, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pupperdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ4oDkDLFCfLkSZWeJLK9ftqPdDefSuuGtTJFnkSKVpJe", "voter": "0x056c57efB4a6e45B4242933Cc46dF7d69676537E", "created": 1632361918, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pupperdao.eth"}}]}
