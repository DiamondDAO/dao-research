The monk would \u201coversee\u201d the farms and add multipliers to them (based on levels).\n\nThe monk will be able to breed and upgrade it's level, giving larger multiplier. It could be traded, sold, burnt, and other functionalities that would add utility and value to the xTao ecosystem.\n\nEach Monk would be unique. One person can have more monks of different levels (which may be used on certain pools or traded) but only one is the Caretaker (gaining experience by time spent in the farms). This can also be exported as a picture you can use as the Telegram profile picture (or profile picture for any other social media. It's your monk, your personal NFT, you decide its purpose).\n\n(More thought has been put into this, but there is not enough space here for this, so I only propose the core idea).", "choices": ["I would love this feature", "I don't think it is a good idea"], "start": 1624226400, "end": 1625443200, "snapshot": "8471305", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5848Efdf08e30DD59a1583f8dF7d7d77BD1812BE", "space": {"id": "frictionfinance.eth", "name": "FrictionFinance"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmaGZA65m3EfcGFEBP7MA9SnHFaLDeaTcyQPrCuYHuWrSG", "voter": "0x1E449bC189f81722516A2C7B5c5B03a9ae57983d", "created": 1624642234, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frictionfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNS7X7kh4CF5FhLShQVySsu3m7JbwPkGjaHaJngGMXQgQ", "voter": "0x5C3d14e1DA2D26A86f46CBb8c05F51F9ff199390", "created": 1624623597, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frictionfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQBmcce3iTG4ZpSfePMYZ99pxko8Lhy7qn6G5xb8tALDb", "voter": "0xdfAB629e75ec0E7bB6c6c3E044829000462f5400", "created": 1624576488, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "frictionfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc5H6d9y12fx1Y4sm7ZXRjyUKej35fRPQZdSYJJX4ZD64", "voter": "0xB6636526C005a7C493b360bA141694f9e493182E", "created": 1624520282, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frictionfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbtsY9scQDvBeh7pzJdnP265BRwGEkrfH2rt95H581NCm", "voter": "0x23441d21149BD94adf6C27010FDB7f9AF2115a99", "created": 1624409391, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frictionfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUJhr6GyokmGGvXhSC8LKg1W7cKcQnXvRejMPgsnmeLAJ", "voter": "0xc28C0971dF37ef7cCF25cc927dd803e558201B8e", "created": 1624389052, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "frictionfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmemrGoRmb3YGX9MgAX5AYeG9CpRP6UjCKPJWmqDVtFoJ5", "voter": "0x5848Efdf08e30DD59a1583f8dF7d7d77BD1812BE", "created": 1624346416, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frictionfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWcJsyWuWUEGdFeWD6c2bJJh5bwF4k9tugRJenDaNZZPk", "voter": "0x6c6e9AaB25f703e55a8d3a8132d2B8499eA6F2e2", "created": 1624333948, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frictionfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbYjiM3DUPRbNc2jEvXSWgK1Uj73aKfgdpkr3icfSBP3f", "voter": "0x57c26e0a6C846bBd8B356B8f21CD95A9e658C51b", "created": 1624278160, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frictionfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPPEaPLDfDp7P34rr2JUUVe55VFnmA3XXdZSMne16iHnj", "voter": "0xEd40f8031C07C9cb521bE965d32dD7802c9e4993", "created": 1624276427, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "frictionfinance.eth"}}]}
