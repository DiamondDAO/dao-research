{"id": "QmXhWeRZ48synvSHB36wP5FtD3Xj6UtLCJRmegrURn7GYu", "title": "Proposal | Permutation 2: The Genesis", "body": "This permutation aims to provide a framework for creating generative art with hashes. It\u2019s structured as a Pilot followed by 4 subsequent drops that comprise the first season of generative art released by the Hashes DAO. \n\nThe Pilot will provide an opportunity to flesh out the process and tech required to execute the drop. Then based on what we learn, we can refine both process and tech to streamline it for the subsequent drops in the first and future seasons. \n\nThe ultimate aim is to develop a marketplace and artist collective built on hashes that could one day join ArtBlocks in the pantheon of generative art. \n\nEstablished and Emerging Artist Format\n\nThe proposed format for the Pilot is an established generative artist, Joshua Davis, partnering with an emerging artist, Jana Styblova. This format aims to both engage established artists in a series of drops while also providing opportunities for emerging artists to gain exposure. For example, established artists could return and partner with a new emerging artist each season. And emerging artists could one day level up to featured artists and lead their own drop. \n\nJoshua Davis: https://joshuadavis.com\nJana Styblova: https://janastyblova.com\n\nDrop Mechanics\n\nDrop structure including edition size(s) and mint price tbd, potentially including but not limited to:\nsingle edition auction(s)\nlimited edition series\nopen edition\n\nThe Roadmap\n\nThe first season of generative art released by the Hashes DAO can provide a template for future drops and evolve based on what we learn. \n\n[Selecting Artists] We\u2019ll need to refine our process for selecting established artists and decide whether to let them choose the emerging artist or setup a parallel process to select emerging artists. \n\n[Marketplace] The tech requirements for scaling these drops will become clearer after we do a few of them. But at a basic level, we should develop the tech required for a generative artist to mint a collection based on the 1K DAO Hashes, presale to Hashes DAO members and sell the remaining pieces in a public sale. \n\n[Artist Collective] We have an opportunity to establish an artist collective comprised of all the artists that drop with us. In addition to earning royalties from primary and secondary sales, these artists can also be rewarded with influence (helping select artists and contributing to the roadmap) and ownership in the Hashes DAO (airdrop DAO hashes or DAO tokens if we ever decide to go that route). \n\nThe Team\n\nThe Genesis Permutation requires a lead and a person (or group) to manage each of three work streams: technology, marketing, and operations.\n\nI (Kintsugi aka Hash Hodler) would take the lead and we\u2019d run a nominations process for the other three work streams, similar to the process for The Harvest but with one main difference*. As the permutation lead, I select from the nominated contributors who is responsible for each of the three work streams: technology, marketing, and operations. \n\n*I\u2019m proposing this structure so large voting blocks, such as the two wallets that alone had enough votes to pick the Permutation 1 team, can't do the same for this permutation. (Adi clarified the large voting blocks that picked the Permutation 1 team were separate from the 100 shares allocated to DEX Labs during the initial mint)\n\nResponsibilities\n\nLead (Kintsugi aka Hash Hodler)\nconceive the permutation, shepherd it through DAO governance, and lead the team to ensure it\u2019s successful\n\nTech (tbd)\nassemble the tech to mint and sell generative art based on hashes including the building blocks required for the drop including but not limited to auctions, raffles, and whitelisted sales\n\nMarketing (tbd)\npromote the drop in the discord and on social media including contests, partnerships, giveaways, etc\n\nOps (tbd)\nrecruit artists for the collective, ensure the drop goes smoothly, and help the other functions as needed\n\nRoyalties\n\nThe royalties generated by this Permutation are to be split evenly among the 4 contributing functions: the lead, tech, marketing, and ops. Whoever is responsible for each function can decide whether to assign their royalty to the Hashes DAO (perhaps in exchange for additional support) or keep it for themselves.\n90% of primary sale to artist, 10% to Permutation 2 team\n10% secondary sale royalty: 5% to artist, 2.5% to opensea, 2.5% to Permutation 2 team\n\nNext Steps\n\nOnce the team is in place, we\u2019ll work closely with the artists and DEX Labs team to ensure the tech is ready in time for the drop and iron out some details including what the drop will be (eg. still images or video), how we\u2019ll promote it, and which other artists we should include in the first season.
