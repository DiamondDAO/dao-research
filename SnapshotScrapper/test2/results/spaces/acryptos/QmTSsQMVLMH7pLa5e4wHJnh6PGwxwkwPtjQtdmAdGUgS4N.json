I am the holder of \"I played for YFI\" NFT given to people who were the first one to farm YFI and not purchase it.\n\nMy strengths are understanding the DeFi landscape, knowing the intricacies of emission, APYs and governance.\n\nI am not a coder nor a technical person but I know how to build a community and explain people the complex structures in simple language.\n\nI have built a strong SXP community on Twitter and still running weekly giveaways for SXP community for 12\nstraight weeks. Everything paid from my pocket.\n\nI can bring a strong twitter game to the project, be involved in managing people and spread the word. Present things in a simpler way consistently something like bluekirby\n\nI thereby propose my name  for nomination as a core DAO member. Though during the time of the snapshot I did not hold ACS, but I am committed to the platform and have put my trust in the developers and deposited a sizable chunk of my portfolio in one of the vaults.\n\nI will leave the rest to the community to decide.\n\nTwitter: twitter.com/DoctorDeFi\nTelegram : @Rahiljnmc", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1608184800, "end": 1608271200, "snapshot": "2875888", "state": "closed", "author": "0xC2bd25138e153Db429f16aF0cd12f9F44C23ceaf", "space": {"id": "acryptos", "name": "ACryptoS"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
