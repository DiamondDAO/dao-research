(but still not friendly enough psychologically speaking)\n\n3-Change only the welcome, even not having one is better! but still we would miss the MAIN ISSUE: \"RED\" Samurai ", "choices": ["Change it all", "Coins/welcome color only", "only no welcome animation", "Satus quo Looks appealing enough"], "start": 1616065200, "end": 1616886000, "snapshot": "5772756", "state": "closed", "author": "0xAF9237403b25C9Ca0A3C4400D8B8ADC6d9727b86", "space": {"id": "acryptos", "name": "ACryptoS"}, "votes": 21, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZJHGj92dxWXkBxqWfrsR2yPVR6Fcfs5Antg5YYoTwgft", "voter": "0xDeCB61D996c5A9125fbE7cA803577a8736DFe8c6", "created": 1616870889, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmSTcfFvkvVCSJUJPXEviM1GEmow7jgrkQZF8SGeXdNjJS", "voter": "0x88E6EC143B925F01BEB45a5D2b310f8074D971BF", "created": 1616843528, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmawRmrf47uy6xLvPp3A2x1vKFdkr9wKUa6ck3qe6uzLdN", "voter": "0x77220bdf6D3BD8288BF090D38D091bACfEC3BdbB", "created": 1616668908, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmXaA6GGzrLT5B6F67A6WZ4pADoy5ipvWdjKWTGx1NKhbQ", "voter": "0x8C96B0f76E5b31D62FbB4C3e0866b76D692d1048", "created": 1616580584, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "Qmf5C1W18HbG4gBPUGbkksALMCMSvMeSwwcuQERnSwmdiL", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1616536342, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmQfxxUK27euaKYg6tLmj53PWbrcockU9NuhoqkGbujehv", "voter": "0x614bff606FdA9C8e09EA734fBF023dc1fb2F19c2", "created": 1616466801, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmbaiUnJDyuYDvPMR29HYsdVDLEyX1T7jDKUCNb4fn2tcJ", "voter": "0x01ECE003e844135E6A14D0f1B0cbBb12ca309cE8", "created": 1616434590, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmSxXbbRu89kHpbWv5DLvcf1Z3NQDwdB6CVfddo1EET3fz", "voter": "0x9144d3DD30E5b951D480e0977AA9Da231bfE92e2", "created": 1616410535, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmXeyQ34ipt428tkoXVT1pQ26b16cTwGLTBqadQuG7a7WL", "voter": "0xb659545f564c30733b1156e0bfB5B82C7D40DD31", "created": 1616390657, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmZsVWRHwZP7AsAAnbELGtN6DXVQR34TALSYpbwtXRbPMs", "voter": "0x645012D0307a987F339ae7Dd5360A074C7CCD6c7", "created": 1616344117, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "Qmed85sTrPyqWPiFWnkH81GDSBFKMFj22TfZ1FbvvqWVew", "voter": "0xCF92C918dFC673fa206ed3C0Fb0Eb8b44B588Bca", "created": 1616344097, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "Qmc7HNXjYoLDBfX95GeJC9yddjREYfjkjXPHdsT6FycTFm", "voter": "0x132ad72Fa599360568025F724d3c62535d6bB462", "created": 1616333247, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmdAQmqx7A9A6CKgbv1Wt8jPNwzGYcNftjhsJ6xnLSJ1TB", "voter": "0x988BA74a1986A3Be55e2c3ecb2a6257dE934cc86", "created": 1616284788, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmcWUkFudJNGebwh8N4caQ7gVKkr84J8G6eAw2CjzQ65N5", "voter": "0x434E2d1b14d2717394D2cB20D69D5709341823f5", "created": 1616260921, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmQwEZL8uHNxK3A78qiQiQAcubcjJxacVZ5FmZJDUYqgXi", "voter": "0x54EEA510887F9dDeCA59335e31D22dd8b785c0D7", "created": 1616234339, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmWeEnsqsVEwfzzqkApMD6HHNswUhQVgLXhNYmBM35wdLj", "voter": "0xa25A93F5029e14b8a26b871f353Fc9d0762C04Ca", "created": 1616169419, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmRW5SgrUVGwZAiRtCLyCnYSXfgE4QkEKhBMgkkCNn4jC7", "voter": "0x1607F6b354377e7B793d6A6F5aeF869e7eadb49a", "created": 1616165630, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmcWBLYxRe8eaqgZwvrZNBQmQy6KwfgrJdzEFRz7pAmYXi", "voter": "0x62eEBA3329B422F8150ce8961332FF80D059f2AA", "created": 1616148046, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmPhzHrxFQhJY8kVgmPmxA7qpRrcZbyevY7BRvwXKkwdUF", "voter": "0xD5e8fb342C09D9bD5F1Bfb00EFA9D4d0c55FafF7", "created": 1616141532, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmUiDFZK4L7p5Fbxtz4HJUAcWKoxRWnbnUpzUT9VUooxek", "voter": "0xc146Ee89086D6791F9f6b340Fafd2b7A03f2fDaD", "created": 1616102388, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmNu6QQZJuYX8kFfF5g6mySWHnXGg3RRFEFDBA74C7WvkS", "voter": "0xAF9237403b25C9Ca0A3C4400D8B8ADC6d9727b86", "created": 1616099515, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}]}
