I have given several options, as I am personally unsure where it should be raised to.\n\nThere is a short voting window for this referendum, because it will require prompt action to achieve maximal benefits.\n\nMy reasons for proposing the increase are as follows:\n\nThe Unifi Protocol community have been very supportive of ACryptoS in the recent past and we have recently shared a platform with them during 2 AMAs.\n\nUnifi recently acquired a smaller token known as $SEED with a merger deal, and will be absorbing the $SEED token market cap (~$6.5M) and converting the value into their rewards token, $UP. \n\nAround 2% of the total market cap of BEP20 SEED will be injected, as liquidity rewards, into the UNFI-BNB liquidity pool, which ACS already supports with an ACS vault. As it stands, slightly more than $45,000, but potentially more, will be shared out amongst UNFI-BNB liquidity providers over the coming weeks. The liquidity pool contains $450,000 at present so this is a flat-rate injection of 10% in a short space of time.\n\nThis is likely to bring an influx of new liquidity providers to the UNFI-BNB pool during the promotion period, in search of those rewards, and this in turn offers ACS an opportunity to attract new users by 'boost'ing the terms we offer to UNFI-BNB liquidity providers! This can be on a temporary or permanent basis and I would like to leave the issue of duration entirely to the discretion of the ACS team.\n\nI personally recommend that we increase the ACS boost weighting as far as we are able to - even if it is only on a temporary basis - in order to capture the attention of these new users and convert them into ACS users too! :)\n\n-----------\nHow to interpret the poll:\n\nIf votes for the 3 'approve' options cumulatively outnumber the 'decline' options, then whichever of the 3 weights (0.3, 0.5, 1.0) has the most votes, has been selected.\n\nIf 'decline' takes >50% of the vote, then no increase shall occur.\n\n-----------\nThanks for reading, please vote! :)\n-----------", "choices": ["Approve: raise to 0.3x", "Approve: raise to 0.5x", "Approve: raise to 1.0x", "Decline"], "start": 1628182800, "end": 1628442360, "snapshot": "9773495", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4B57D24a0c391112F5E8ca0bF23B659f8D8d9fEe", "space": {"id": "acryptos", "name": "ACryptoS"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmbVysm83X26EthR7N5utkcLXufVSpPbJ5it6iYCErimzb", "voter": "0xBD493d0ED5B5858990D6dF3e9C54Aa43fa164E20", "created": 1628357537, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmdzTxkuLmXZkptkQFSm5rwgtSWhTWdY1Ha7ZNQin8BsT9", "voter": "0xd81008065eC031e540B251E9aFa5A3f246e1C6fb", "created": 1628285395, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmNTDZS5dsY5WCb5PPVfwtxBWArTAmbX4w8ita5NNsRDHC", "voter": "0xa127ecddECe648CBaAFc65E604A0258005956b82", "created": 1628270594, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmfAuSm4F973oaV18T3VyePnUpcrpGCc1HrcZ38kSefSvV", "voter": "0x15d7029F7f6Dfe2B116C9EDDeB81BC228f3a680F", "created": 1628221123, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "Qma2qtAWtCLP7HE7heQjZx5SDpMyATkN9jLV6oSwffWxoj", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1628220062, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmQXSaz6SVS3neQPQbELWSxpwbR5BSfS3g7udYTptNTBA4", "voter": "0xb4b3bDEC9c126fAD4f18c2CA9B6ba564E23f0305", "created": 1628202313, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "Qmbzh2zrzaF23Gb6xdsRbPRad82HmgQoE3ZdXvPeE42c19", "voter": "0x2d34DdB6B5EdEbac00b255260869862a6E07F814", "created": 1628202279, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmUkg9vHtaC1y3XrajaMGrGfQeH4c9pvKccnsPgVRTLDun", "voter": "0xfd5D74FC5Af20355de920878921449C662E08735", "created": 1628199593, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmeHLM5ehcm4XWBphEi1S1uBTL1hMrnqDu1AmyDACArAcJ", "voter": "0xB448f19C3b7dfA29b6e1424Abd448e09395A3De3", "created": 1628190253, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmTeNLW9T9XgNNkLk5yYfPWpFBnHQgHvs9XpqdNaE1nABt", "voter": "0xe8358C0337Cd4517E35669B77851C18dFdF657A2", "created": 1628186080, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}, {"id": "QmeQQGAEZs98ScnVxfuNCgkR4yNcHAAUSnNGUQJ6APFEWz", "voter": "0x4B57D24a0c391112F5E8ca0bF23B659f8D8d9fEe", "created": 1628185776, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}]}
