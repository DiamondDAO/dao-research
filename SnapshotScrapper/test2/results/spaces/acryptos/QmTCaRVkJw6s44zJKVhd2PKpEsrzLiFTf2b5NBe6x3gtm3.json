At this current rate, it would take 20-25 whole days of staking, just to cover the 10% withdrawal fee. I think we need a way to make people more interested in holding their ACS and staking them, rather than selling. (side note: the acs vault daily pay % is very low compared to other acs daily %'s on the site. For example: you have a higher acs daily payout by staking bnb-eth, rather than actually holding & staking acs, which makes acs less attractive, and would make people want to sell acs to buy more bnb-eth instead)", "choices": ["Possibly Increase APR", "Possibly Decrease Withdrawal Fee", "Create a bonus for holding ACS?
