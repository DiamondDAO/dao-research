At this current rate, it would take 23 whole days of staking, just to cover the 10% withdrawal fee. After 23 days, you would start to be profitable. In addition to all of this, over the past week, the total locked value in the ACS vault has more than doubled & if this rate continues, the daily gains will keep on dropping as well and eventually it will start to take 1-2 months of staking, just to cover the fees.", "choices": ["Drop the fee from 10% to 5%", "Drop the fee from 10% to 3%", "Drop the fee from 10% to 1%", "Double the ACS APY ", "Triple the ACS APY", "Make the ACS APY dynamic"], "start": 1612695600, "end": 1612868400, "snapshot": "4653038", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2c51aFaeD0539935234ECdf60c2AC6BE2dE4deb5", "space": {"id": "acryptos", "name": "ACryptoS"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdcYmGKUHHx2KqricErHggJuKZRcr6XUViWj6uiVt2dHN", "voter": "0x2c51aFaeD0539935234ECdf60c2AC6BE2dE4deb5", "created": 1612697351, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "acryptos"}}]}
