She has \u201creal life\u201d industry connections, having spoken at major crypto conferences such as Consensus, and has traditional media connections (magazines, newspapers, TV, etc.).\n\nShe helped build two crypto projects previously to varying degrees of success, one a total failure and one reaching an over $250m market cap (no longer). Ogle designed or co-designed the tokenomics for 3 of the current top250 coins on CMC.\n\nShe is also a heavy investor in ACS and thus has an obvious interest in it being well-run. Ogle has a different nom de plume in the cryptosphere outside of BSC, but wishes to keep them separate.\n\nOgle believes strongly in a very cooperative BSC ecosystem, and to that end created the Telegram group @bscgemz so that projects owners, admins, developers and serious users can collaborate with each other, rather than always see one another as pure competition.\n\nTG username: Ogle (@cryptogle)\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/cryptogle\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1608184800, "end": 1608271200, "snapshot": "2875888", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1D25ECC34A5034EF0D9d449d46c53EFD3a07Da3A", "space": {"id": "acryptos", "name": "ACryptoS"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
