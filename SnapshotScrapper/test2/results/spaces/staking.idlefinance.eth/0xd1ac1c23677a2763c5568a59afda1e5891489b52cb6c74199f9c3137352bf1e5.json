Add IDLE to idleFEI", "body": "### Summary\nThis off-chain poll aims to gauge the sentiment among stkIDLE holders regarding [IIP-15](https://gov.idle.finance/t/iip-15-remove-dydx-and-cream-add-idle-to-idlefei/713), which has been [launched on-chain](https://idle.finance/#/governance/proposals/15).\nIf the poll will reach the quorum, the vote will be broadcasted on-chain.\n\nThis IIP would enable $IDLE liquidity mining on IdleFEI, deactivate dYdX from DAI and USDC Best-Yield pools, and remove Cream from IdleFEI.\n\n### IIP Motivation\nThe post \u201c[dYdX deactivation](https://gov.idle.finance/t/dydx-deactivation/695)\u201d already informed $IDLE token holders about dYdX Solo (Layer 1) protocol shutdown and proposed the wind-down of that protocol for DAI and USDC pools. The proposal already passed the [Temperature Check](https://gov.idle.finance/t/dydx-deactivation/695/3).\n\nIn regard to idleFEI, last week Idle Leagues introduced the idea of [enabling $IDLE farming for the FEI pool](https://gov.idle.finance/t/enable-idle-liquidity-mining-on-idlefei/696). With IIP-15 approval, the idleFEI pool will then be included in the $IDLE liquidity mining program and will dynamically receive $IDLE depending on TVL and APY of the pool.\nThe potential target market is $500m (circulating supply). The proposal already passed the [Temperature Check](https://gov.idle.finance/t/enable-idle-liquidity-mining-on-idlefei/696/8).\n\nThe third initiative proposed with IIP-15 is the [Cream removal from idleFEI pool](https://gov.idle.finance/t/remove-cream-from-idlefei-pool/709).\nCream protocol suffered a [$130m loss](https://decrypt.co/84590/cream-finance-suffers-third-hack-losing-over-130-million) on 27th October 2021, making it the third-largest DeFi hack in history. The attacker found a vulnerability in the platform\u2019s lending system and used it to steal Cream\u2019s assets. Following this incident, Cream can no longer be compatible with [Idle\u2019s risk profile](https://gov.idle.finance/t/integration-standard-requirements/513) and Leagues propose to remove it from idleFEI (the only pool supporting it).\nThere are no material risks on Idle side, as the rebalancer already paused any possible Cream deposit, but this IIP would finalize the underlying protocol deactivation. The proposal already passed the [Temperature Check](https://gov.idle.finance/t/remove-cream-from-idlefei-pool/709/3).\n\nCheck the details of the motivations [here](https://gov.idle.finance/t/iip-15-remove-dydx-and-cream-add-idle-to-idlefei/713).\n\n### Details\n\nActions:\n* dYdX removal from Best-Yield DAI and USDC pools: 2 actions\n* $IDLE liquidity mining activation on idleFEI: 2 actions\n* Cream protocol removal from idleFEI: 1 action\n\nThis IIP complies with the [stkIDLE Voting Framework](https://gov.idle.finance/t/voting-framework-for-stkidle-holders/567).\nOnly stkIDLE holders can vote on this poll.\n**Threshold to make the poll valid** (both metrics should be reached):\n- 30% of circulating stkIDLE voting the poll (min. 84\u2019127 stkIDLE)\n- at least 70% on the same option\n\nIf the poll reaches the quorum, the community multisig will broadcast the decision on-chain.\nCurrent On-chain Voting Power: 378\u2019670 $IDLE\n\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve IIP-15 execution\n**AGAINST**: Vote against IIP-15 execution\n", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST"], "start": 1635948000, "end": 1636106400, "snapshot": "13544304", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540", "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth", "name": "Idle (staking)"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdR2T4VRCFfmzdea3pNcCA7SbAe9bQELYU2US9HbBCxRc", "voter": "0x8B6Bbd8e858CC515352E5846a9E5b607Ad43826F", "created": 1636104202, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbmUBZfsNYp2Af2ar3RYnQyAGSLpxowU5YJSUeH2uiAXv", "voter": "0x50eE80E8a86D50B8e7f302B23bB666a4f5d89e4A", "created": 1636103989, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbukko4fb2JuMCfkm9X82pfkmgtnT88pXmt1Fwz3EfQ6u", "voter": "0x251327a84d2A3C58eAc3E0891273ec6B05DcfEd6", "created": 1636102743, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe89ec29604026bef3b08c8b566b6dbc00a070e766f20c9beae572337f878f4fb", "voter": "0x83Deb18dC5574dF9558ABF719b7e109fe050560e", "created": 1636101162, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "0x48c9b3f7040ed24ae90e180da9cd433428c69563c2dfe3b2ff34e0d76f05c5e3", "voter": "0xF1363D3D55d9e679cC6aa0a0496fD85BDfCF7464", "created": 1636071559, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUh4SHzW3ozQV6dV2KmWcETahHDUbUFPYZpHApUEunsZ1", "voter": "0xefdF3E3B64d6B3820f3063D76cb8Db6A8CF1E196", "created": 1635984548, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "0x21da264d07018c6517b9801a283534aa4a44eed9f158504e63a3db8f6abee330", "voter": "0x6f85D3CB1990CECAe9f91c164e7a851937969314", "created": 1635950422, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}]}
