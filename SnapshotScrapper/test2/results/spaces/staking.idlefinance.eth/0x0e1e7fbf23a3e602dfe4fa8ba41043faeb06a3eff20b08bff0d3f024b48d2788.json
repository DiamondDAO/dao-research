All funds are safe and no action is required by partners or users. **Deposits in Idle protocol have always been safe**.\n\nTo dampen any possible malicious outcome on the partners\u2019 side, Leagues activated [the Pause Guardian procedure](https://docs.idle.finance/advanced/admin-powers). The `deposit` and `rebalance` functions have been temporarily paused on Ethereum, while `redeem` is still available. This IIP does not involve Polygon strategies, which have been already updated.\n\nIIP-17 will finalize the issue removal by changing the `flashLoan` method in a no-op, effectively disabling this functionality. After the on-chain execution of IIP-17, the protocol can be unpaused and `deposit` and `rebalance` functions activated again.\n\nA more in-depth analysis will be made in the future on a possible fix that would allow \nflash loans to be offered in the Idle protocol without creating similar issues. A detailed description of the potential partners\u2019 vulnerability is available in [this report](https://idlefinance.medium.com/potential-vulnerability-disclosure-2021-11-18-9bc0a2cdc0f2).\n\n\n### Details\nThe new implementation is available [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x577d963246d28dbe0dc579048adda421b054924a).\nThe code for the IIP is [here](https://github.com/Idle-Finance/idle-proposals/blob/main/scripts/iip-17.ts).\n\nWith one action still available in IIP-17, Dev League proposes to also include a minor update related to idleFEI Best-Yield (proxyAdmin update). This update is not related to the potential vulnerability fix described above.\n\nActions:\n* IdleToken update: 9 actions\n* idleFEI Best-Yield proxyAdmin update: 1 action\n\nThis IIP complies with the [stkIDLE Voting Framework](https://gov.idle.finance/t/voting-framework-for-stkidle-holders/567).\nOnly stkIDLE holders can vote on this poll.\n**Threshold to make the poll valid** (both metrics should be reached):\n- 30% of circulating stkIDLE voting the poll (min. 87\u2019857 stkIDLE)\n- at least 70% on the same option\n\nIf the poll reaches the quorum, the community multisig will broadcast the decision on-chain.\nCurrent On-chain Voting Power: 393\u2019232 $IDLE\n\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve IIP-17 execution\n**AGAINST**: Vote against IIP-17 execution\n", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST"], "start": 1637431200, "end": 1637593200, "snapshot": "13653430", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540", "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth", "name": "Idle (staking)"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x54c2aa20fcd9091bbe6223c10f68bf5aa0172165dda4794a5778f5cdd1d02b3f", "voter": "0xF1363D3D55d9e679cC6aa0a0496fD85BDfCF7464", "created": 1637530967, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNretRnc3xrxsNGDyWCkGpxhwgNTN3bPRB3nMW7CfanDk", "voter": "0x8B6Bbd8e858CC515352E5846a9E5b607Ad43826F", "created": 1637505554, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVazcqLQ7FzJfj6XXMVQvLM7vdcK427diRZHn5sHUX4kM", "voter": "0x251327a84d2A3C58eAc3E0891273ec6B05DcfEd6", "created": 1637505251, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRAiDnRwM1oRdi8rZ6GTtTr941qrb9DyawALBcPLoGMj7", "voter": "0xefdF3E3B64d6B3820f3063D76cb8Db6A8CF1E196", "created": 1637498187, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaHU4a567nJQymfwi5TtQSbT8vjvcjnVekbokGQxvkapT", "voter": "0x50eE80E8a86D50B8e7f302B23bB666a4f5d89e4A", "created": 1637491240, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "0x2aa30f24abb17d842347bfc38a05064f2e821fe8db274b1be50d8f461ae20c88", "voter": "0x83Deb18dC5574dF9558ABF719b7e109fe050560e", "created": 1637487153, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}]}
