If Governance will approve this proposal, the idleFEI pool will then be included in the $IDLE liquidity mining program and will dynamically receive $IDLE depending on TVL and APY of the pool.\n\n$IDLE liquidity mining would allow Idle to attract a wide potential target market ($500m circulating supply). At the same time, the extension of $IDLE governance ownership to FEI LPs would represent a way to incentivize participation in the upcoming idleFEI tranches, built on top of the Best-Yield strategy.\n\nThe Fei community will then have access to the \u201cneutral\u201d Best-Yield, \u201cprotected\u201d Senior Tranche, and \u201cleveraged\u201d Junior Tranche, expanding the suite of yield optimization products.\n\nThe collaboration with Fei DAO could further incentivize liquidity provision thanks to [TRIBE Liquidity Mining](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tribe-liquidity-mining-emission-schedule/3549) distributed via Tribal Chief Programs. Lastly, Fei DAO could also consider Idle as a yield source for its [$1b PCV allocation](https://app.fei.money/analytics), which is mainly deposited in Aave and Compound. \n\n\n### Details\nThe technical implementation will be developed by Dev League.\n\nActions:\n* idleFEI liquidity mining activation: 2 actions\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve $IDLE liquidity mining activation on IdleFEI\n**AGAINST**: Vote against $IDLE liquidity mining activation on IdleFEI\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST", "DISCUSS MORE"], "start": 1635339600, "end": 1635512400, "snapshot": "13499551", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540", "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth", "name": "Idle (staking)"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWM6veGsLTwAh6iNowALpZFPSXCjT8ZtszSRdjtnbjyMw", "voter": "0x50eE80E8a86D50B8e7f302B23bB666a4f5d89e4A", "created": 1635420958, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "0x166d37a51d0bddb232fa5d5aadaecb5cb32d19e8aac7baea41d44fd2713f7bb0", "voter": "0x83Deb18dC5574dF9558ABF719b7e109fe050560e", "created": 1635408660, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "0x897d0c21134922d3738ba261545522fb2a4a1bc336c1e544fa148d45663cef1a", "voter": "0x84BD9ed56A1c9e4bB367fe655134A5D0E0Fe1b13", "created": 1635362558, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "0x506279d8465f3285759731fce2a5f96c44c759fda6892bb94cab5966e230a63a", "voter": "0x6f85D3CB1990CECAe9f91c164e7a851937969314", "created": 1635340401, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}]}
