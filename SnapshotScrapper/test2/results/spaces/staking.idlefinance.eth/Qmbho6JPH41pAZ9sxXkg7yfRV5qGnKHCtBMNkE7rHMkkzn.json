With this in mind, we are proposing a revised structure for the positions and responsibilities of each current Leagues member.\n\n### Current Members and New Positions\n**Treasury League**\n*

Labs members\nAs Idle Labs (the genesis team and company), we would like to begin a process of integration of part of the core team (founders + Idle Labs contractors) into the DAO \u2013 the goal here is to ultimately dissolve the company and have all the active contributors for the Idle Protocol working for the DAO.\n\nAs part of the founding team, we will always commit ourselves to the long-term success of the protocol and DAO, with respect to our internal token and governance [policy](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-labs-team-policy-and-governance-participation/207). \n\nFurthermore, we (Idle Labs members: @Teo, @william, @samster91, @Davide, @gravityblast) would like to forego the next mandate\u2019s compensation for our positions in order to boost the growth of the Leagues-Labs structure and allow more active community contributors to join the Leagues, scaling initiatives, and growth for the protocol.\n\n### Voting Options\n\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n\n* **IN FAVOR**: Re-confirm the current Leagues\u2019 team members with renewed positions \n* **AGAINST**: Not proceed with re-confirmation\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token
