It's replaced by Comptroller#compBorrowSpeeds and Comptroller#compSupplySpeeds. This proposal copies the current rates into the new storage variables.\n\nIdle protocol\u2019s oracle uses compSpeeds and it needs to be updated with compSupplySpeeds.\nExecuting the change, IdleController will properly account for COMP rewards when calculating how much IDLE distribute to each IdleToken.\n\n### Details\nThe new implementation is available [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x886b102953ab3eaf719df7b80b03cd5203c201f1).\n\nActions:\n* Oracle update: 1 action\n\nThis IIP complies with the [stkIDLE Voting Framework](https://gov.idle.finance/t/voting-framework-for-stkidle-holders/567).\nOnly stkIDLE holders can vote on this poll.\n**Threshold to make the poll valid** (both metrics should be reached):\n- 30% of circulating stkIDLE voting the poll (min. 83\u2019631 stkIDLE)\n- at least 70% on the same option\n\nIf the poll reaches the quorum, the community multisig will broadcast the decision on-chain.\nCurrent On-chain Voting Power: 377\u2019888 $IDLE\n\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve IIP-16 execution\n**AGAINST**: Vote against IIP-16 execution", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST"], "start": 1636995600, "end": 1637154000, "snapshot": "13621754", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540", "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth", "name": "Idle (staking)"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xc8a400f0bc61b5462afe3ca46170502b939e8d31bf2c9b0950e7c1fede84021d", "voter": "0x83Deb18dC5574dF9558ABF719b7e109fe050560e", "created": 1637084719, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "0xd0f784e097ef9ad2fb8a6cf03e31e01ff64f2843b52a3c9016329ea9fb119d45", "voter": "0x6f85D3CB1990CECAe9f91c164e7a851937969314", "created": 1637061593, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVAM1xW6nkjcA14VnYGbb6PbMavGUBTR4BNnwUXkY6d3m", "voter": "0xefdF3E3B64d6B3820f3063D76cb8Db6A8CF1E196", "created": 1637059395, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}]}
