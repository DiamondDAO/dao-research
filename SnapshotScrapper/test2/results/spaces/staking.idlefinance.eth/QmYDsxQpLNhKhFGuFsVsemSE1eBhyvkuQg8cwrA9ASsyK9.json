Afterward, with RAI approved and available on Aave, this yield source became part of idleRAI as well.\nIn mid July, idleRAI passed the Integration Standard Requirements and got approved for Production stage. Governance unanimously approved the extension of the $IDLE LM program to idleRAI via [Temperature Check](https://gov.idle.finance/t/enable-idle-farming-for-the-rai-pool-2/576).\n\nLately, the Governance also [agreed on removing Cream](https://gov.idle.finance/t/proposal-remove-cream-from-the-rai-aggregator/603) from the list of supported yield sources in this pool. One action of this IIP will be dedicated to stkAAVE farming, approved by [Aave Governance](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmeHAwW7XwUD3vqYLMRPF8MJiXkj2nnbRg1ae7mZ1SNQdm).\n\nThe second batch of transactions is related to Leagues\u2019 next mandate funding. Governance approved via [Temperature Check](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-leagues-v2-0-leagues-labs-mandate-3/584) to allocate $104\u2019300 + 16\u2019183 IDLE to fund operations, scaling activities, and compensations.\nAn additional $4k is required to cover ETHglobal hackathon prizes, not executed during the previous mandate.\n\n### Details\nThe technical implementation was developed by Dev League.\n\nActions:\n- idleRAI liquidity mining activation: 4 actions\n- $RAI support on FeeCollector: 1 action\n- Cream removal from idleRAI: 1 action\n- stkAAVE support on idleRAI: 1 action\n- ETH transfer from FeeTreasury to Treasury League: 1 action\n- stkAAVE transfer from FeeCollector to Treasury League: 1 action\n- $IDLE transfer from Ecosystem Fund to Treasury League: 1 action\n\nThis IIP complies with the stkIDLE Voting Framework. Only stkIDLE holders can vote on this poll.\n\nThreshold to make the poll valid (both metrics should be reached):\n- 30% of circulating stkIDLE voting the poll (min.71\u2019996 stkIDLE)\n- at least 70% on the same option\n\nIf the poll will reach the quorum, the community multisig will broadcast the decision on-chain.\nCurrent On-chain Voting Power: 378'898 $IDLE\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\nFOR: Approve IIP-12 execution\nAGAINST: Vote against IIP-12 execution", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST"], "start": 1631815200, "end": 1631955600, "snapshot": "13238225", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540", "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth", "name": "Idle (staking)"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdmjuipHofpvGb6atmgR4bKApfLC8AzRhxDitMkBrWi6T", "voter": "0xefdF3E3B64d6B3820f3063D76cb8Db6A8CF1E196", "created": 1631932009, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeDgrxzj7Lm6LhVjvxotMjdwVxBEhDik9RBYwZtp5kiWg", "voter": "0x50eE80E8a86D50B8e7f302B23bB666a4f5d89e4A", "created": 1631920374, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfWzTbiosGUuzNmLgJxJcccbY6s5P5BopjXBtsJh3AvK1", "voter": "0x34AAa3D5A73D6f9594326d0422ce69748F09b14F", "created": 1631919377, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTsf3urPmd8baZEfKaULqFyfvWfKThT2snfc3dDNffbHP", "voter": "0x251327a84d2A3C58eAc3E0891273ec6B05DcfEd6", "created": 1631912034, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbZ3Mc5Z33T9NQn9XdnBDQrn1GphLFWAAUBwFWAbt4vqZ", "voter": "0x6f85D3CB1990CECAe9f91c164e7a851937969314", "created": 1631836347, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ7aQ1igZS1FvHfbK8ApMhGYu8FgsfsSHp9XHY8gYDf2f", "voter": "0xa3E2330e4fA9BB23d7EAAa3628b2C1906EeAD200", "created": 1631833519, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}]}
