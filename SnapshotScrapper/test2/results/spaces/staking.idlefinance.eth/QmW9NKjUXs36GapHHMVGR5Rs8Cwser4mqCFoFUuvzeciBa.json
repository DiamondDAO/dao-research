{"id": "QmW9NKjUXs36GapHHMVGR5Rs8Cwser4mqCFoFUuvzeciBa", "title": "[Temperature Check] - Voting Framework for stkIDLE Holders", "body": "### Summary\nThis Temperature Check aims to define the frameworks that [allow stkIDLE holders to vote off-chain and on-chain proposals](https://gov.idle.finance/t/voting-framework-for-stkidle-holders/567).\nWhen [on-chain proposals](https://idle.finance/#/governance) are live, an [off-chain poll for stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth) will mirror the on-chain question. There are two possible options to set the poll\u2019s thresholds that make on-chain vote broadcasting valid.\nWhen [off-chain polls](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) are launched, an [off-chain poll for stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth) will mirror the off-chain question. This proposed solution would aggregate the stkIDLE votes with the ones cast by $IDLE token holders.\n\n### Motivation\nWith the launch of $IDLE staking, stakers have no more access to voting features.\nTo enable the on-chain voting option, the governance tokens deposited into the staking contract are delegated to a community multisig.\nThe implementation of an ad-hoc off-chain voting strategy lets stkIDLE holders cast their preference for on-chain proposals, and a community multisig is in charge of on-chain vote broadcasting once the off-chain polls reach the thresholds, voting with its entire balance.\n\nThe same off-chain ad-hoc voting strategy can be used to let stkIDLE holders cast their preference for off-chain polls.\n\n### Details\nON-CHAIN VOTES\n**Voting strategy**: [stkIDLE holders voting space](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\n**Threshold to make the poll valid**:\n- *Option 1*: low quorum (30% of stkIDLE) but high consensus (70%+ on the same choice). This option would require a minimum of 21% of stkIDLE voting the same thing. A lower barrier to entry would allow the Governance to reach the 520,000 $IDLE quorum on on-chain proposals easily. Drawback: a tiny group can potentially pivot a large number of votes.\n- *Option 2*: high quorum (60% of stkIDLE) but low consensus (51% on the same choice). This option would require a minimum of 31% of stkIDLE voting the same thing. Benefit: the parameters require a large voting base, so the final vote can not be influenced by few individuals.\nDrawback: if the poll does not meet the quorum, the vote is not broadcasted and this voting power can not help the Governance reaching the 520,000 $IDLE quorum.\n**Voting weight**: 100% of the staked $IDLE voting weight\n\nOFF-CHAIN VOTES\n**Voting strategy**: [stkIDLE holders voting space](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\n**Threshold to make the poll valid**: no quorum required\n**Voting weight**: the voting stkIDLE amount is calculated in the form of weighted IDLE tokens using the formula: \u201ctotal IDLE staked / total stkIDLE minted * total stkIDLE voting the snapshot * % of each option\u201d\n\nThe sum of the voting weights cast by $IDLE and stkIDLE holders represents the final snapshot results.\n\nThis poll is the first one launched for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**OPTION 1**: Approve option 1 for on-chain stkIDLE vote broadcasting and the proposed solution for off-chain polls\n**OPTION 2**: Approve option 2 for on-chain stkIDLE vote broadcasting and the proposed solution for off-chain polls\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the on-chain and off-chain Voting Framework for stkIDLE holders\n**AGAINST**: Not proceed with this proposal\n", "choices": ["OPTION 1", "OPTION 2", "DISCUSS MORE", "AGAINST"], "start": 1627918200, "end": 1628177400, "snapshot": "12946566", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540", "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth", "name": "Idle (staking)"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmU82iSNqZU9FNxXXPshBTENovxnfBnyFgGxrN6UGvmVcC", "voter": "0xa3E2330e4fA9BB23d7EAAa3628b2C1906EeAD200", "created": 1628132427, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPn8WBcfLTy8QhwwicRKZeiY63GwYYsQuPMUmhXfik26v", "voter": "0x8B6Bbd8e858CC515352E5846a9E5b607Ad43826F", "created": 1628091972, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdjmBNXSat96mzmgRHFhQ1odAvUjUgEL4pfkoNrGh4odK", "voter": "0x50eE80E8a86D50B8e7f302B23bB666a4f5d89e4A", "created": 1628080323, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVbY9nHpgoWahPxUXB2ompgHi1DRA6U8hLoTDVLF9WxG7", "voter": "0xF578082d65126Fcc2c2635Cda9d5b52697708577", "created": 1628072638, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYxxqKfBdTz9DcFon94AHbrGSdsKvmHd3A2hYUQWZu6aW", "voter": "0x34AAa3D5A73D6f9594326d0422ce69748F09b14F", "created": 1628038673, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXYBbxYiJpevBnidXzWLijneqEgn34eMXAoKcYVthiYLa", "voter": "0xDB478114EB8301A7acE35513c3312C1EEB8D99d0", "created": 1628038155, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma3atjT1z2hGQpRtfpkG1dDi5bwM7XNXx22UV8UcA1fsx", "voter": "0x189E6BE4D4fa3CaABEA2dBF4e764Bb331E9610c7", "created": 1628028055, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUM6f2VTisVsj3S8zuaWfLALkbAkTGzcE3QztbDYX1Mxy", "voter": "0xefdF3E3B64d6B3820f3063D76cb8Db6A8CF1E196", "created": 1628006484, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcaRWbycVs9pSneWec9h42nUMdf3KNH3j8LPRpqe1AXN8", "voter": "0x5485623Ac7e4F38cC0B3979F4E7BB916BBdB3D88", "created": 1628005570, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT55RVuzbsoP6bjJw1BcBuC4NdWuag8FhHEJJf97MYP6N", "voter": "0x6f85D3CB1990CECAe9f91c164e7a851937969314", "created": 1628004510, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPBcxYpCojirbUzzDD8ZgBGpseRFTckbpK1KssdZtQJWk", "voter": "0xF1363D3D55d9e679cC6aa0a0496fD85BDfCF7464", "created": 1627920919, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}]}
