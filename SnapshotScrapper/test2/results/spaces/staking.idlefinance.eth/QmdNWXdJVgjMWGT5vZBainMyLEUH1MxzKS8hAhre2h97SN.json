When multiple and different Leagues members coordinate with each other on the same feature area, they form a Lab. Labs help build alignment across Leagues and aim to maintain it over the course of an initiative workflow.\n\n**Compensation Packages**\nWe feel that the compensation packages proposed during the last mandate have been broadly accepted and helped us find great talents within our community.\nInsofar, we would like to propose the same level of compensation, with the only addition of using [Opyn Vesting Options](https://gist.github.com/alexisgauba/cf055f521bcfded018116f3f37074f67) on the IDLE bonus part. This would act as an additional incentive for Leagues members to reach major achievements, similar to equity options that startups typically use to incentivize employees.\n\n**Mandate Budget and Duration**\nIn May, the Treasury League received 11k IDLE as new budget and 5k IDLE from the past League mandate.\nIn addition, at the mandate initiation, the Dev League received $20,000 in ETH for technical operations and deployments - the wallet still holds $18k (6.4 ETH).\n\nHaving Treasury League reserves entirely in IDLE has exposed the budget to extreme market fluctuations, underperforming during the past months. Furthermore, the counterparties we have been working with often accepted only stablecoins, and the sole workaround available to us was to have Idle Labs managing the payments.\n\nThis time, the planned Treasury League\u2019s budget would use stablecoins as a unit of account for operational expenses and stablecoins/IDLE ratios for compensations.\n\nIdle Labs would like to begin a process of integration of part of the core team with the DAO, merging the genesis team with the Leagues structure. Idle Labs members will forego the compensations for the next mandate and expenses reported below include only rewards for contributors not affiliated with Idle Labs. More details in the [proposal to re-confirm the current Leagues\u2019 team members](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-leagues-v2-0-current-team-reconfirmation/585).\n\nThe Leagues would like to allocate the following amounts to the respective Leagues\u2019 multisigs:\n**Treasury League**: $84.3k in stablecoins ($50k operational costs, $34.3k compensations) + 16\u2019183 IDLE (compensations);\n**Dev League**: $0, as the committee can self-sustain future expenses with current reserves\n**C&M League**: $30k in stablecoins\n\nA detailed breakdown of the fund allocation is reported here: [Budget Projection Mandate #3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sD5k7DmTWC4Y_fJlFue8ZB1ItpZl0mYV0H3N6CQNpM8/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nCurrent Idle DAO reserves (non-IDLE assets) and final reserves after Leagues funding are reported below (with market values at the time of writing):\nFeeTreasury: $91'000 (ETH + others)\nFeeCollector: $58'000 (stkAAVE + others)\nLP staking: $21'000 (SUSHI)\nSmart Treasury: $99'500 (ETH)\nTotal: $269'500\nLeague expenses: $104'300\nReserves after Leagues funding: $165'200\n\nLastly, the proposed mandate duration is 3 months.\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**IN FAVOR**: Approve the Leagues V2 structure, mandate budget and duration\n**AGAINST**: Not proceed with this proposal\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the structure, budget and duration\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n", "choices": ["IN FAVOR", "AGAINST", "DISCUSS MORE"], "start": 1628283600, "end": 1628542800, "snapshot": "12973684", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540", "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth", "name": "Idle (staking)"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNcvKRJu8cG3Mn7UpfgoPn6TfWJ4Ujn1SyX8tLZoCbDAn", "voter": "0x83Deb18dC5574dF9558ABF719b7e109fe050560e", "created": 1628531108, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXy533YApL3FEBsDhzDihUDbW3eNZa3eNDFbd4XeLAF5q", "voter": "0xDB478114EB8301A7acE35513c3312C1EEB8D99d0", "created": 1628516434, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSJnMVHBvTKGoJMi8RSN7NRvWrQVTqBqZYDPkrA4Q4bFc", "voter": "0x34AAa3D5A73D6f9594326d0422ce69748F09b14F", "created": 1628516272, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPxteB5AMv4kESQndk5A3VfdLwXjCH4Fg6PtscXe2sYgz", "voter": "0xefdF3E3B64d6B3820f3063D76cb8Db6A8CF1E196", "created": 1628504334, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSiwH5FNYeiDdUU2QExoNSENs6vgKDX81Ap9aH1HhpHko", "voter": "0x6f85D3CB1990CECAe9f91c164e7a851937969314", "created": 1628322159, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}]}
