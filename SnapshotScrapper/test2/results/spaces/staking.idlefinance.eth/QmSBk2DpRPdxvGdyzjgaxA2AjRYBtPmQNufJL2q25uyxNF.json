{"id": "QmSBk2DpRPdxvGdyzjgaxA2AjRYBtPmQNufJL2q25uyxNF", "title": "[Temperature Check] - Idle and Polygon $700k partnership", "body": "### Summary\nThis Temperature Check aims to approve a **$50k commitment in $IDLE tokens** from Idle Ecosystem Fund to partner with Polygon in a $700k agreement.\n\nIdle Leagues and Polygon team would jointly foster the development of native Polygon projects using Idle, with a **$650k $MATIC incentivization program** and a $50k $IDLE allocation.\n$MATIC rewards would be shared with any integration partner that implements Idle\u2019s allocation strategies, while $IDLE funds would be used for grants and hackathons.\n\n\n### Motivation\nIdle yield automation and aggregation are becoming a unique value proposition to enable other projects to easily access different yield opportunities with just one integration effort.\n\nIdle would represent a top-notch gateway to deploy funds and maximize returns on Polygon, letting integrators focus on vault development, yield tokenization, fixed-yield products, and other on-top use cases.\n\nRead the motivations [here](https://gov.idle.finance/t/proposal-idle-and-polygon-700k-partnership-to-jointly-scale-defi-yield-aggregation/647). \n\n### Details\nA Dune dashboard, similar to the one for B2B partners, would track referrals and reward distribution over time.\n\nProgram outlines:\n* Max incentivized TVL: $300m, first-come-first-serve\n* APY boosting: +20% relative increment compared to APY provided by Idle strategies in Polygon, up to +1% net APY\n* Rules: incentives are issued weekly to partners in proportion to the deployed TVL\n\nThe program is designed to last not less than 3 months, with the expected incentivization phase lasting about 4-5 months. The max program duration is 6 months: Idle Governance would give back any unused funds to the Polygon team after that period.\n\nIf Idle protocol reaches $300m TVL via partners\u2019 deposits during the program, the Polygon team will commit an additional **$1.35m** in $MATIC to extend the program for 6 months more.\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve $50k allocation from Ecosystem fund and partner with Polygon\n**AGAINST**: Do nothing\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST"], "start": 1630400400, "end": 1630659600, "snapshot": "13132442", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540", "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth", "name": "Idle (staking)"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXVwU2rXVez7K5HUQppzLtVVy3ieCMB6XxhNSNnX8mvNv", "voter": "0x34AAa3D5A73D6f9594326d0422ce69748F09b14F", "created": 1630616367, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmatSStiMnfAN8GFi2q4CuRw4nVY8affU6Lw1koa5LjTFU", "voter": "0x50eE80E8a86D50B8e7f302B23bB666a4f5d89e4A", "created": 1630416135, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRda6hwbH2qMEoJxnpHmM3Hda5Di9Qi9ZEv96fMJNFnyJ", "voter": "0x6f85D3CB1990CECAe9f91c164e7a851937969314", "created": 1630409077, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYJa3oLKVKA6V2fnvEp683Ti296Jj7nnmy7mKm18MdvUW", "voter": "0x5bCfC2dee33fBD19771d4063C15cFB6dD555bb4C", "created": 1630405639, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "staking.idlefinance.eth"}}]}
