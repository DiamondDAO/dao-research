{"id": "QmY3fSbz6uXXQaA17FR9exuFy4RwZpiuM8R2QYM3g8XvuP", "title": "Preliminary collaboration with Tsuki DAO project", "body": "This proposal is based on positive discussions with the Tsuki DAO team regarding a mutually beneficial exchange and opening the door to future collaboration opportunities between our communities. There is an understanding that this could be an opportunity to grow together with very little downside risks. \n\n# Motivation\nBoth communities have been subject to volatile market conditions that have held back growth but have kept their heads high while building and planning for a bright future. While our ETH chain Waifu's have held up relatively well, our BSC Waifu's could use some attention too, which is where the Tsuki DAO project comes in.\n\nBy exchanging a small amount of reserve assets from one another's treasuries, the goal is to take a stake in their project's future and vice versa. It helps that there is also a thematic fit between the projects which can lend itself to opportunities to learn from each other's successes and failures. For example, both of our projects plan to capitalize on the massive potential for gamification of NFT's.\n\n# Actions\n1. 25 BSC Waifus aka Baifu's from our Dungeon will be minted and sent to their treasury in exchange for a fair determined amount of $TSUKI from their treasury, for example, 5 $TSUKI each.  \n2. We provide liquidity for the $BNB-$TSUKI pair as a show of good faith and hold the asset in our treasury awaiting further decision.\n3. The Tsuki DAO team may use the BSC Waifu's for the purpose of a game test run, a giveaway/airdrop, or simply hold the BSC Waifu's. Accrued WET is paired with BNB to provide liquidity.\n4. Both teams agree to assist with at least 3 marketing tweets publicizing the collaboration e.g. *\"Tsuki DAO raids the Waifusion Dungeon\"*.\n\n# Decision\nYes - 25 BSC Waifu's for 5 $TSUKI (~$15 USD) each \nYes - 25 BSC Waifu's for 7 $TSUKI (~$21 USD) each \nYes - 25 BSC Waifu's for 10 $TSUKI (~$30 USD) each \nYes - 25 BSC Waifu's for 15 $TSUKI (~$45 USD) each \nNo - Don't collaborate\n\n*---- Market values at the time of posting ----*\n-$TSUKI trades for $3 USD\n-Cost to reroll a BSC Waifu is a burn + $35 USD\n-Floor price for BSC Waifu on NFTKEY is $80 USD\n\n*Note: At the end of the voting period if yes is the majority, the voting power weighted average of the price selections will be taken to the Tsuki DAO team as our final offer*\n\n", "choices": ["Yes - 25 BSC Waifu's @ 5 $TSUKI", "Yes - 25 BSC Waifu's @ 7 $TSUKI", "Yes - 25 BSC Waifu's @ 10 $TSUKI", "Yes - 25 BSC Waifu's @ 15 $TSUKI", "No - Don't collaborate"], "start": 1625101200, "end": 1625468340, "snapshot": "12733853", "state": "closed", "author": "0x844D29169323BEacfCbA369f550810B6BAf17366", "space": {"id": "waifusiongov.eth", "name": "Waifusion"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYQEaLjRDvGDkxNh3vV7EAqVF99wWWNMAbSkB8cdaxt9L", "voter": "0x8fF60872cac49C94074750f19ba9d2C39419C19B", "created": 1625110367, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "waifusiongov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUBRt1UzG518Tvr7K3L5EEK5AFhK3m8wUu8pRMa67HJR6", "voter": "0xE83AEea883CD0729Df01e3B7589EdC6d47BE898a", "created": 1625103091, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "waifusiongov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPv3nVcdJpr1k7ryZRUGtefXNszsA6aVmCwKdSgt1gniZ", "voter": "0x844D29169323BEacfCbA369f550810B6BAf17366", "created": 1625102959, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "waifusiongov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd1wyNmiQKoX8vZqLs5TBiTkPhgn27M2Nqw6ouST3eMEm", "voter": "0x08D816526BdC9d077DD685Bd9FA49F58A5Ab8e48", "created": 1625101475, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "waifusiongov.eth"}}]}
