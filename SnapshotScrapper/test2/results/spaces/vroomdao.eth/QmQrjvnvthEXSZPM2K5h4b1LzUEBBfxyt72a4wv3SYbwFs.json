Reading and abiding by these rules is a condition of membership of vroomDAO\u2019s Discord server. This applies to all community members, including Moderators and Administrators. Failing to follow these rules may cause a Moderator or Administrator to warn, mute or ban you and/or delete any infringing messages or threads, subject to the rules below. \n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, in the event that you are banned from the vroomDAO Discord server, you will still be entitled to vote on proposals on Snapshot or any future DAO platform.\n\n2.\tTrue identity policy \u2013 a suggestion.\n\nvroomDAO strongly requests all members to use their real names when identifying themselves within this server. Therefore, please adhere to the following naming mechanism: [FIRST LAST] \u2013 [COMPANY, @SOCIALHANDLE]. For example, Brian Trunzo \u2013 Burrata Corp., @ntbro. \n\nIf you are not active on social media, please feel free to leave the \u201c@SOCIALHANDLE\u201d field blank.\n\nIf you do not wish to adhere to this policy, we understand. However, we strongly suggest it because we find it is good for community building.\n\n3.\tPost in the appropriate channels.\n\nRead channel descriptions if you\u2019re not sure. Moderators and Administrators may ask you to move your conversations to the correct channel (and subsequently delete your original post).\n\n4.\tSpeech will be lightly moderated.\n\nWe welcome diverse opinions and hold freedom of speech in the highest esteem. Many of us are crypto-anarchists, libertarians and cypherpunks; however, abusive speech, including racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic or any other exclusionary and/or hateful language, will not be tolerated. Depending on severity, the following penalties may apply:\n\n\u2022\tFormal warning by bot or Moderator,\n\u2022\tTemporary muting, or\n\u2022\tComplete ban from vroomDAO\u2019s Discord server.\n\n5.\tThreatening behavior: zero tolerance policy.\n\nThreatening behavior toward another member of vroomDAO will not be tolerated and will result in an automatic ban from the vroomDAO Discord server.\n\n6.\tThese rules are subject to further revision by vroomDAO as needs arise. Any and all such revisions must be formally submitted to a Snapshot vote before ratification and implementation.\n\n7.\tDiscord\u2019s Terms & Conditions apply to all members of the vroomDAO Discord server.\n\n", "choices": ["Yes, I approve", "No, I disapprove"], "start": 1632520800, "end": 1632693600, "snapshot": "13291006", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7b78F347cc40F15344EDE278EcEC4E39E1F15485", "space": {"id": "vroomdao.eth", "name": "vroomDAO"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTTjhpuW3eMiYc7rpj2vmmknCvS78qFVf1xkHX7CWbUAg", "voter": "0xfbf3F340C62d4CbDe3e241BC784c840aA3E5e80A", "created": 1632586659, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vroomdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPuDbY2hGK79BT9611f8xnwKUWCx1jZhSoMMDZVwAxHE8", "voter": "0xB0F0EA6B0353a0548F57dB876F035112c5910735", "created": 1632581131, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vroomdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdToWxYEy8nukVD1CcvQu1vKk3BBgsdd1X7fGC3u4BoNg", "voter": "0x9C37796570Ec55558C5C669d2560c124d7Fd0C5C", "created": 1632569762, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vroomdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXAvo5HQqRWF6GYFxPwgXzgE9TvF1BCYpgZJrq3s56DME", "voter": "0xAD9D8630fad580b12cd51eFa31Ce185D95454ee3", "created": 1632546754, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vroomdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdR1DfrxuekUUcrHWC7WjFVrtZMLFQM88bPgbk49ZNiC2", "voter": "0xbA03633392F33571E9dB71AAB6C26863ADd857CA", "created": 1632521308, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vroomdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVnsFMjWfpqqc459mJBf8gAqFCKq8KtQysmxCpmkaRkfe", "voter": "0x7b78F347cc40F15344EDE278EcEC4E39E1F15485", "created": 1632520944, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vroomdao.eth"}}]}
