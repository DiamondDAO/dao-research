The new model targets optimal utilization rate at 80-90%, which provides sufficient room for ETH withdrawal while efficiently utilizing most of the supplied ETH, increasing interest earned on ETH for lenders.\n\n## Current Interest Rate Model\n\nThe current interest rate model follows a triple-slope interest rate curve:\n- At 0-50% utilization rate, interest rate will be fixed at 10%\n- At 50-95% utilization rate, interest rate goes up linearly to 25%\n- At 95-100% utilization rate, interest rate goes up linearly to 100%\n\n![](https://github.com/AlphaFinanceLab/AIPs/raw/main/assets/aip-2/old_rate.png)\n\n## Motivation\nETH is under-utilized. Due to lower yield farming APY, the current interest rate model only achieves 50-60% utilization rate, where borrowers\u2019 interest rate is ~10% and lenders\u2019 interest rate is 5-6%. \n\n\n## Specification\n\n### New Interest Rate Model\nI propose a new interest rate model to allow the supplied ETH to be efficiently utilized. The new model will also follow a triple-slope interest rate curve:\n- At 0-80% utilization rate, interest rate goes from 0% up linearly to 10%\n- At 80-90% utilization rate, interest rate will be fixed at 10%\n- At 90-100% utilization rate, interest rate goes up linearly to 50%\n\n![](https://github.com/AlphaFinanceLab/AIPs/raw/main/assets/aip-2/new_rate.png)\n\n## Rationale \n### Why this model?\n- Starting from 0% interest rate \u2192 This allows the borrowers (or yield farmers with leveraged position) and lenders to decide what\u2019s their optimal interest rate. The interest rate can be as low as 0%.\n- The model\u2019s target utilization rate is 80-90%, where the borrowers pay no extra interest rate (fixed at 10%). This optimal rate provides enough room for lenders to withdraw their supplied ETH while efficiently utilizing the supplied ETH.\n- The interest rate spikes up towards the end to discourage too high of a utilization rate (to prevent a situation where ETH lenders cannot withdraw ETH due to over-utilization).\n\n\n### How does this affect the current model?\nWith the current utilization rate (~50%), the borrowers will pay a slightly lower interest rate and lenders will receive a slightly lower interest rate. However, this should provide incentives for borrowers to borrow more ETH, driving up the utilization rate, which would in turns increase the interest rate for lenders.", "choices": ["Accept", "Reject"], "start": 1604116800, "end": 1604721600, "snapshot": "1968415", "state": "closed", "author": "0x22CF9eE4E86fAE2552021F6e6a7bbe87d6170075", "space": {"id": "alpha-bsc", "name": "Alpha Finance (BSC)"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWRCJFoMP1tvmYGJPg8a3T2B7aNZdmZt4NAmrsYLSTr2n", "voter": "0xadB45c036A8321833f9c7A41218F2EfAeeED0c5c", "created": 1604566329, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alpha-bsc"}}, {"id": "QmTPzkJPVPzVRKQKptFFmRMRwTCZyHWBz7Y3FhqmUoNgiS", "voter": "0x181E5dC5DAE55922790e3E7D0eF68C83990Ccc45", "created": 1604563667, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alpha-bsc"}}, {"id": "QmXgmjxZ9aC5gZPzEgbeeMng6ZRgDqTMw67bfXZBF6nsFu", "voter": "0xf4Eb92b855cDD30088A5bf7C0BA60016B1E84cE8", "created": 1604561638, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alpha-bsc"}}, {"id": "QmdAfzRBG64yJPt6P5Q65whdiTaq1PKYxHMUFmECSAgEMg", "voter": "0x416fD3D38f031229100Fc80Dfc0552f00D59E2c6", "created": 1604557443, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alpha-bsc"}}, {"id": "QmbjbUs51NEg2jVzHZy67csCHKBurGYxq2goXnJajJdakj", "voter": "0xc40eAB956e48555270De96F26ACa138Fe08A6a1a", "created": 1604325932, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alpha-bsc"}}, {"id": "QmeZ7sJfG8veoWPL2RsZYY73dxZmxeQ7EJV5S7XmU2vBat", "voter": "0xd3078F3db526844Fc01f91325f0810464BaF0E93", "created": 1604209473, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alpha-bsc"}}, {"id": "Qmb79P1uLZCW4KTPeKk8Bq9Fm7bumPY8TxDeE56ApBf5b6", "voter": "0xc58B775068B8B55e64BbD0936a16a85C1f2d2D47", "created": 1604190425, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alpha-bsc"}}, {"id": "QmakYm4nCSoupdxe5fcjEA652cBay23H2ZdDkaqhZoeM55", "voter": "0x99C2C1fE781e13c6537578C8a9280273DbCd7b34", "created": 1604147474, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alpha-bsc"}}, {"id": "QmafW3CXep5tEWVBPQXgn1t26y8GLRRDW4XSWh2ZnyQFyC", "voter": "0xa8d25C5A6f832a9423038c86529391aA7B7F91a0", "created": 1604136531, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alpha-bsc"}}, {"id": "QmTTYtz32cSx2m9rqHh9FbzaooyKDdMZdCDQ9M2CvuygkW", "voter": "0x4b3C7259a1AB45704c2B9EFD2193bB801C6Bf6Ff", "created": 1604130761, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alpha-bsc"}}, {"id": "QmWULKdxt3W15QDbcUCVgrZQTK9gav6RGmGGtzSuvEMP6D", "voter": "0x3c5Aac016EF2F178e8699D6208796A2D67557fe2", "created": 1604120359, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "alpha-bsc"}}]}
