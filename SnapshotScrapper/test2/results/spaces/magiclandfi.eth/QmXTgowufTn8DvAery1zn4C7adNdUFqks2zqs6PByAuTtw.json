Therefore, the land is proud to initiate MAGIC DAO for Magicland bagholders to propose and vote any proposals that help to grow the Magicland. \n\nSo now let's practice and cast your first MAGIC to kickstart MAGIC DAO governance! \n\n***Due to technical implementation of snapshot on Arbitrum, only MAGIC bridged to ETH mainnet is eligible for this proposal voting. The snapshot & Magicland team are working with an alternative of multichain snapshot strategy that will include MAGIC token on Arbitrum and iMAGIC token on IoTeX soon. \n\n", "choices": ["YES TO MAGIC DAO", "NO TO MAGIC DAO"], "start": 1632701280, "end": 1633306080, "snapshot": "13303791", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2d08b22ea80f8036A0292a6Ae115070ae5933Fd4", "space": {"id": "magiclandfi.eth", "name": "(inactive) refer to MAGIC DAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
