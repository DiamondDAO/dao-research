Ad hoc Individual Contributors were paid on completion of a given project. This budget proposal takes similar form, with intent to continue this work, while also adding three new IC roles (with flexibility for a fourth).\n\nRecent and current allocations can be found at 0xbBB8c9Ace4590d98f0A56FA311C6fBA0CEA3a68D, which has a budget lifespan that will last until October 4. With the ribbon-cutting of governance, it is time for budgets to be collectively assessed and ICs to be paid from a multi-sig.\n\n## Definitions\n**Ad Hoc** expenses are expenses which are paid on a case by case basis. These will be documented and published quarterly.\n\n**ICs (Individual Contributors)** are individuals who contribute to the development of the DAO in a formal sense.\n\n**Recurring** expenses are expenses which are paid on a cyclical schedule\n\n## Requested budget breakdown \n\n| Purpose | ROOK Allocation\n|---|---|\n| Engineering | 400 |\n| Partner Outreach Development | 120 |\n| Translations | 50 |\n| Discord Bot Development | 45 |\n| Community Grants | 250 |\n| **Total** | **865** |\n\n### Engineering budget\nWe will continue our two IC Engineers who are paid weekly at 10 ROOK/week: @shadow and @pangolin. Their KeeperDAO work can be noticed with performance and design improvements throughout app.keeperdao.com. \n\nI also introduce a new role which we will be recruiting for: *Partner Integrations Engineer*. This role will be focused on assisting our partners with integration.\n\nAdditional discretionary funds for another IC role is included in case it is needed. If unused, it will roll over to the Quarter 1 2022 Budget.\n\nThese are *recurring* roles.\n\nAt a rate of 10 ROOK/week for all of the above, the sum is 400 ROOK.\n\n| IC | Duration (weeks) | ROOK\n|---|---|---|\n| @pangolin | 13 | 130\n| @shadow | 4 | 40\n| Partner Integrations (TBD) | 11 | 110\n| Discretionary (TBD) | 11 | 110\n| **Total** | **39** | **400**\n\n### Partner outreach development\nWe are seeking someone to support connecting and facilitating relationships with potential partners. I believe @destroyr is a perfect candidate for both, and should be contracted as a `Partner Outreach Developer`. Troy has been involved in the space for several years, going back to helping Nano grow in 2017 and has also been intimately involved in KeeperDAO helping with documentation, web copy, and research.\n\nThis is a *recurring* role.\n\nAt a rate of 8 ROOK/week for all of the above, the sum is 120 ROOK.\n| IC | Duration (weeks) | ROOK\n|---|---|---|\n| @destroyr  | 15 | 120\n| **Total** | **15** | **120**\n\n### Translations\nWe need translations for our many webpages and documents. We recently added German but we have some loose ends, and we should add support for Spanish. This is to fund that.\n\nThese are *ad hoc* roles.\n\n| Group | Ad Hoc ROOK Allocation\n|---|---|\n| Translators | 50 |\n| **Total** | **50**\n\n### Discord bot development\nThere are several bots for Discord we would like to add which are relevant to current products as well as future products. This is an open role, and can be filled by multiple bot developers (dividing and conquering is fine for this project).\n\nThis an *ad hoc* role.\n\n| Group | Ad Hoc ROOK Allocation\n|---|---|\n| Discord Bot Development | 45 |\n| **Total** | **45**\n\n### Community grants\nWith the birth of decentralized KeeperDAO Governance, I anticipate many small projects to come up to foster community growth, accelerate development, discover and support partners, and so forth.\n\nThe projects decided will largely be community-decided, community-driven, and community-developed. This will be completed transparently and also documented and compiled for a reviewable budget summary at the end of Quarter 4.\n\n| Group | Ad Hoc ROOK Allocation\n|---|---|\n| Community | 250 |\n| **Total** | **250**\n\n## Special considerations\n\n### Excess ROOK Rollover\nIf excess ROOK exists (due to an IC role not being filled, an ad hoc need becoming unneeded, an IC needing a week off, etc.), excess ROOK will carry over to the next quarter.\n\n### Retroactive payment\n\nThis KIP was targeting a September approval; the structure or intentions do not change. Due to the delay, some contributors are working on good faith so some of these above payments will be paid retroactively. That is all.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Before October 4, send 865 ROOK (and 1 Eth for gas) to a new multi-sig address. It will be managed like the IC address has been for the prior few months, with payments on Mondays for recurring ICs or on project completion by ad hoc ICs. The address will be managed by ~3 Core/Labs members (including myself). I volunteer @WhatsTheDeetz and @Pai-Sho (if they have the bandwidth). I volunteer these two because @WhatsTheDeetz is involved in all things community and @Pai-Sho is helping coordinate Labs engineering.\n\n2. Pay ICs on recurring or ad hoc schedule throughout the coming quarter.\n\n3. Recruit `Partner Integrations Engineer`, `Discord Bot Developers`, and a `Spanish Translator`.\n\n4. By December 31, @lapras will summarize expenditures, assess rollover, and work with the community to decide if this model worked well and should be standardized and extended (with quarterly budgets).\n\n", "choices": ["No objection", "Object"], "start": 1634400000, "end": 1635004800, "snapshot": "13428893", "state": "closed", "author": "0x00fA720A0943Cc51145b78775d2A4B8B5d83EcCc",
