While DeFi loans are convenient and exciting for users, high collateral factors equal to high cost of capital for borrowers. Particularly institutional borrowers who operate funds on margin, cost of capital is a major issue in DeFi. \n\n## Key Considerations\n\nNew companies/protocols like X-Margin, ArcX, and Teller are working on DeFi native credit score mechanisms, taking into account user's history of trading, governance participation, airdrops as well as off-chain inputs such as traditional credit score.\n\nThese mechanisms could inform a user's \"creditworthiness\" in DeFi loans and provide additional benefits on identifying users who carry less borrowers risks\n\nInitial proof of concept could take into account inputs such as borrowed amounts and creditworthiness. These inputs could help classify a loan into different collateral segments.\n\nThe thresholds for liquidation alerts / margin calls could also be informed by creditworthiness. \n", "choices": ["Yay, do it", "Nah, don't"], "start": 1631289600, "end": 1631894400, "snapshot": "13193822", "state": "closed", "author": "0xd16F12b1C5B1CFbc14893b620578196021E97e68", "space": {"id": "alkemidao.eth", "name": "Alkemi Network DAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
