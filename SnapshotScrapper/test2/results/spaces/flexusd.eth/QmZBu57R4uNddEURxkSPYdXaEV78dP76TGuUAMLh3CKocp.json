Earn additional yield for flexUSD holders by efficiently deploying funds in repo markets.\n2. Provide fairer demand-based funding rates to perpetual futures traders.\nIncrease the transparency of flexUSD\u2019s yield bearing protocol and promote an open   source approach to stablecoins.\n\n**Motivation**\n\n As it stands the allocation of funds to each repo market is statically determined at the inception of each repo market. This has worked well for now with holders enjoying a rate of up to 48% APR at times. However, as flexUSD grows and the diversity of participants in CoinFLEX\u2019s perpetual market grows; this simplistic approach may lead to an inefficient lending and therefore lower yields for flexUSD holders.\n\n**Specification**\n\n1. Dynamic fund allocation in repo markets\n- 10% of the USDC governed by flexUSD will be split equally amongst all of the repo markets to form a baseline level of liquidity.\n- 85% of the USDC governed by flexUSD will be distributed pro-rata based on the open interest in the underlying perpetual swap market.\n- 5% of the USDC governed by flexUSD will be kept in reserves.\n2. Dynamic utilisation based bidding schedule\n- Bid at predictable levels governed by the Borrower Rate vs Utilization that may be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DwXajFzVRjG5Uq5H9JfAq1YXz3qVIGx1VB267ktQQqI/edit#gid=0\n", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1611680400, "end": 1612026000, "snapshot": "11722255", "state": "closed", "author": "0xFDbaaF1341104722c02aF2F34A33dDfB623A437B", "space": {"id": "flexusd.eth", "name": "flexUSD Governance"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWgAUsv6TxshQtKcFR966sKZUwuRZ4GoYEvsZRbM2LQ5B", "voter": "0xFDbaaF1341104722c02aF2F34A33dDfB623A437B", "created": 1611896335, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "flexusd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVs92FfG5R8KvASwpY1zHTFEd7uBBTxgYqoH9p9utJFzi", "voter": "0x166F407B5f853D9375fC36170781b9c6EFb5023c", "created": 1611767085, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "flexusd.eth"}}]}
