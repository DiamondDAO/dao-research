The team would have a majority of the tokens or the team could veto any vote without problem. iGOV is a special token as there is no fixed supply as to insure whales don\u2019t stay whales for long. Currently there is no real governance structure at unifund but today I want to change that. The current system works like this: The team makes the decisions for project and iGOV holders can suggest something to the team. What I propose is a real governance structure similar to what you would see in a real DAO. Now by no means will Unifund turn into a DAO with my governance structure but it will lead us in the right direction. So if you guys like my governance proposal feel free to vote for it with your iGOV to signal to the team you want a real governance structure. If my proposal gets passed all future proposal by anyone including team members must use this system in order for them to be implemented. \n\n\n\nHow proposals work\n\n\nIn order for a vote to be passed it must have 5% or more of the current circulating iGOV supply in support of the vote. If the proposal passes it moves onto the next phase. If the proposal does not have 5% or more of the current circulating supply of iGOV in favor of the proposal then the proposal will not pass unless the team votes 4/7 (or greater) in favor to veto the community's decision to not pass the proposal then in which the community needs 10% of the current circulating supply to reject the teams vote to pass the proposal. If the 10% is not met then the teams veto to pass the proposal is passed and the proposal by way of the teams decision and lack of community support will be implemented in a reasonable time.\n\n\nThis next phase is the team voting on the proposal that the community was in favor of. If the teams votes in favor of the proposal with a 4/7 majority then the team has to implement the proposal in a reasonable time. If the team votes 4/7 majority not in favor of the proposal then they veto the proposal. \nOnce the team has vetoed a proposal the community will vote of the teams vote for the last time. If the community votes to veto the teams vote with 10% of the current circulating iGOV supply (as of the initial proposal) then the teams vote gets vetoed by the community and will passed and be implemented in a reasonable time. If 10% of the circulating supply of iGOV (as of the initial proposal) does not veto the teams vote then the proposal will be vetoed by the team and the proposal will not pass.\n\n\n\n* If the team doesn\u2019t come to a 4/7 (or greater) vote on a proposal after 3 days after the community passed the proposal they forfeit the right to veto that proposal. If enough team members don\u2019t vote consistently new treasury members will be elected by the community and be added to the  multi sig treasury.\n\n\n* Every single person in the genois safe multi sig treasury counts as a team member. https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x365e9f193833A6436AE08Df6F5B7D892d2629c5a/balances In the future if the number of members in the multi sig changes what ever is minimum majority that will be the threshold for a vote to be passed. So that would be 5/9, 6/11 etc. If the members in the multi sig were to be an even number then what ever is half the members plus 1 will be the minimum for a vote to pass. Ex: 6/10, 7/12 etc. The team also must post their vote in the Unifund Announcement Telegram Channel: https://t.me/UNIFUNDANN \n\n\n\nProposal rules:\n\n1. Must have a minimum run time of 15 days.\n\n2. Proposals must not a run longer than 21 (3 weeks) days.\n\n3. Team votes must not take longer than 7 days and not shorter than 1 day.\n\n4. Initial proposals will be discarded if not passed after 7 days of being posted.\n\n5. The community has 7 days after the team vote to veto.\n\n6. If all conditions are met then a vote is passed or not passed.\n\n\n\nHere is a graphical representation of how my proposal works. As time goes on the number of iGOV needed will need to be changed. And if my proposal on how governance should work doesn\u2019t get passed I will try again with modifications. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/10emJA1\n\n\nAt the end of the day the proposals and changes the community makes are not governed by code but by honor. In the future it will be very necessary to turn Unifund into a proper DAO where changes to the system can only be enforced by code. If something goes horribly wrong like there have never been consistency enough votes to pass any proposal and the only the only way to change the threshold for a proposal to pass it by proposal well then the system has failed. In situations where the project can only advance is by means of the team making changing without approval of the governance system then I believe it is in the community best interest to let those events happen. However such occasions should be rare and hope to never happen. This governance system is to put accountability to the team and to give the people the power, putting your iGOV to use. The future is bright for Unifund and this proposal is only the start. Thank you for taking the time to read my proposal all the way through. My name is InfinityValor and this is the end of my proposal.\n\n----------------------\n\nEND OF PROPOSAL", "choices": ["In support of proposal", "Not in support of proposal"], "start": 1619294400, "end": 1619899200, "snapshot": "12304849", "state": "closed", "author": "0x8e7d244d3479E17c53DE836523cc3F399f931e1B", "space": {"id": "unifundglobal.eth", "name": "Unifund"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVFNBBcDwTP2sAZcx3CGYy66ezWmShzQdVcDqbRU5gj5i", "voter": "0x98e436B30443A7074AE42aeE8791eF894983f1F8", "created": 1619345317, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "unifundglobal.eth"}}]}
