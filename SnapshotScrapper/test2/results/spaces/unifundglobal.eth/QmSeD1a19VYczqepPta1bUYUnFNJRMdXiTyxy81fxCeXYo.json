I made a very simple icon with a gavel & base. The image I used has CC BY 2.0 license, which means it's fine for Unifund to use. In the metadata of the image there should be info to the original picture I used. But even if my very mediocre image does not suffice I would like a proper iGOV icon. \n\nMy image: https://mega.nz/folder/XPgilYgQ#9FzyV2H_suZ9xMaRH6Fm1g\n\nThe .xcf file extension in the folder for the link above is a GIMP file. You can use GIMP which is FOSS to modify my changes to make it better.
