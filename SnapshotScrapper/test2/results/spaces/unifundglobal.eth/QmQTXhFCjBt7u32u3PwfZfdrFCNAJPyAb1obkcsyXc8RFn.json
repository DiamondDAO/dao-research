MMCrypto has significantly improved the Unifund whitepaper. This thank-you payment is well deserved. This proposes a range for the payment as $200 - $1000. IGOV holders can vote on a value in that range and the weighted average will be used. For example, If 2 people vote for a $200 payment and 1 person votes for a $1000 payment, then MMCrypto will be sent $600 worth of IFUND. Please, vote and let's show MMCrypto our appreciation.", "choices": ["1000", "800", "600", "400", "200"], "start": 1624896000, "end": 1625241600, "snapshot": "12723152", "state": "closed", "author": "0x65b0D5e1dc0dEE0704f53f660aA865C72e986fc7", "space": {"id": "unifundglobal.eth", "name": "Unifund"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWGnuMpY9UVMkFLaLHpRmxDgGmCsubZ58ueb5p43UeWsB", "voter": "0xd43A73B4377d8A94ac6EE7A706d2B2d48832086f", "created": 1624949292, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "unifundglobal.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW11suZd7pe3Dzz88jSkRoPufi93KeYHomNa2ohUk6F6Q", "voter": "0xa9C09885530981c950ed52aA599A3616569075A8", "created": 1624915757, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "unifundglobal.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZAcPAxMAfWqD5AN59vQoNnmxBhfmTn4etmvSH1bda26q", "voter": "0x98e436B30443A7074AE42aeE8791eF894983f1F8", "created": 1624903245, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "unifundglobal.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSHzZd4HwcvC5oJ2axfCDMJRigvzRC5G4UntMzPwBV9dq", "voter": "0x65b0D5e1dc0dEE0704f53f660aA865C72e986fc7", "created": 1624900885, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "unifundglobal.eth"}}]}
