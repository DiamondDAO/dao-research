{"id": "QmQ9zzdxMFSqD2B5HTc8QgAQd4zek2C1Zy2wtuVv4xv9FU", "title": "Merge ANJ with ANT: 0.028 ANT/ANJ Proposal", "body": "## Summary \n\nIf approved by ANT holders, this proposal will result in an offer to ANJ holders to perform a one-way conversion of ANJ to ANT at a rate of 0.028 ANT per 1 ANJ. To take advantage of this offer, ANJ holders must commit to locking and activating the ANT they receive in Aragon Protocol for a period of one year.\n\n## Motivation \n\nThe recent discussions have demonstrated the strength of the $ANJ community and its conviction in the Aragon Court thesis. While $ANT holders ultimately have governance power over the Court, we think it\u2019s important to at least understand $ANJ holders\u2019 views and use these to inform $ANT voting. From our perspective, the worst case outcome for both sides is a contentious $ANJ \u201cfork\u201d in which the community is split and Aragon Protocol now has a competitor with the same name (Aragon Court Classic?). Avoiding this outcome is crucial and, our research indicates, easily achievable.\n\nWe think $ANJ jurors who remain committed to the Court vision post merger are more valuable and are worth paying a higher premium to provide they convincingly signal this commitment. Projects such as Synthetix have exemplified the positive effects that locking up users can have on a community and on bootstrapping a supply-side and we feel there are lessons to be learned here. $ANJ holders who want to exit the system should still be allowed to do so and compensated for the upside they\u2019re giving up, but this should entail a much lower premium.\n\n\nAs such, we seek to give $ANJ holders a chance to express their views and signal what premium they would require in order to convert and lock up their $ANJ to $ANT for 12 months. Our goal is to avoid a splintered community and keep as much as possible of the $ANJ community as part of the future of $ANT.\n\n## Specification\n\n- New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of  0.028ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders who take the one-way conversion offer and lock the ANT they receive and activate it in Aragon Protocol for a period of 12 months.\n\n- The Aragon Association will schedule a follow-up vote by $ANT holders on Monday November 23, 2020 lasting 48 hours to decide what conversion rate $ANJ holders who take the conversion offer but do not lock and activate their $ANT will receive. There will be three options, each option put to a separate vote with \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d as the response. The option that gets the most \u201cYes\u201d votes AND has more \u201cYes\u201d than \u201cNo\u201d votes will win. A tie will be broken by a vote of the Aragon Association Board of Directors + one advisor. The options that will be put to a vote are:\n  - New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.015ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders to convert their $ANJ to $ANT with no lock + activation requirement.\n  - New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.0175ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders to convert their $ANJ to $ANT with no lock + activation requirement.\n  - New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.02ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders to convert their $ANJ to $ANT with no lock + activation requirement.\n\n## Discussion\n\n[https://forum.aragon.org/t/proposal-next-steps-for-anj-holders/2478](https://forum.aragon.org/t/proposal-next-steps-for-anj-holders/2478)\n", "choices": ["No", "Yes"], "start": 1605542400, "end": 1605715200, "snapshot": "11269833", "state": "closed", "author": "0xA1d4C9e0a46068AfA3D8424B0618218Bf85ccaAA", "space": {"id": "anj", "name": "ANJ"}, "votes": 24, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYAn3rrDg8aiQHe1C5UANCFQvRL3nB45UgULHVo3tEPoW", "voter": "0xb98139359cfaBE988999c55C6E13DF7A8a98a341", "created": 1605701206, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmYuG59ESFTkigVa9QryVzbaqHSqjL6tUsewsjsweBoFgS", "voter": "0x09feDD3Fb2907449b812D8E243DaA02A2F54f946", "created": 1605700871, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmaDpdYmBVfbCzPnmtTy9HM9fsBkjNEvLMo6Aetjhk6ho6", "voter": "0x78A55BcD131f06D53C756c1707eBf9903bAd43cb", "created": 1605698583, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmUDfpWxNCUKzVGQRed4Auwyz7KsJYK7vDhge8o8HqEQbP", "voter": "0x369799e8308Bfd8D32fe4709dB82af51e6F1cc60", "created": 1605668859, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmXKdzC8FS9akwUBwW7mQAM2coCjsCHyfVm83Ek9vZ9JVy", "voter": "0xe164644e1e8Bb14BA8aA19be1B78ec6CF22F7ca8", "created": 1605650859, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmezFYVZziyowgJCZoq9ew9uT62xs21ZnUNkB5pYndo2Ck", "voter": "0xe2CEa50ba5a302A691B93692e74786D6484Db295", "created": 1605650849, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmdJL65REYjwaYCstRd9SUWvPqupH8dCAbiJHVz38bjQzc", "voter": "0x9aB0b3323B1C9035b90CA4f1E462bb72c5417503", "created": 1605640547, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmVFdMSTF72otsFwSG9R8AAmaLoutZYHyrXjdbJfhAEHXi", "voter": "0xe6df6ce7d10894De35bfB7f38407172Ece977e50", "created": 1605625538, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmUrCpCt51wbLstV3ZdqV9B8HEVxHSKkLjBrVEbAytnzda", "voter": "0x06b172c63730F0cCFb40ea35E726ebF4E930c9e3", "created": 1605625310, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmZTr8LyxuXgVZus3kK2oL7qaYxEN2eAmZtWAUXCsAP7Py", "voter": "0xF0D193D8524eC55fe2F5159aaD2BA1A264993605", "created": 1605609826, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmcdQHf9KWueLuyNuWa69yLLyypa5qrFJDyCNsndgpAKvj", "voter": "0xCac65f771dF97430A2532C6B95568eB788750798", "created": 1605604630, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmSWutizCgMTdzpWgE7Rc3gSwbBhHBwjjqoMHZ9VgzRFtQ", "voter": "0xE8256119A8621a6Ba3c42e807B261840bDe77944", "created": 1605603735, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmTZX9p1C1JhVGWfTuYKNAiGx92D34F3o3wASMtYeXU4HD", "voter": "0xbF3bc2f3D279466686174261BfCCD0Ac07576E59", "created": 1605603391, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmaNFrq7KkL8WAKReZu6pkmWZj1ZSubBDV9QuykJztZWyg", "voter": "0x1a3e98369a9e935d5E807514Fd479Ebf075863c6", "created": 1605599077, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmbAAdi9aPnyH6JH28Vh1w7B75wSStx9ruCpKhB2RWL3VS", "voter": "0xB2e19dd996848818d972DD3a60A1B7FAfFB82330", "created": 1605594987, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmaxBDUpanmoueYvEsFGpMN1mLwc1ci7TbaYoSRCGS9e8g", "voter": "0x64BAde3EA5FFc64CFB776f55cF82086b9429a5ee", "created": 1605589735, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmeubfwoAXKKWrWswtUaguRa5TvD8h2PXqjsA3RZ8QX9e7", "voter": "0x282173335ae1F328b34Eb9Acadc052E59E70A89f", "created": 1605582625, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmYwPfvqKjvbQDuMTDo7KS2K8wE4KWW1Yq5LvVdmYuXPpq", "voter": "0xF6fB9d5efc0f2e521ECB072a72d01368777F08e1", "created": 1605575345, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmaDQiHDtNqEeNcKTphLyrFWNTKYn35eHJnBsWBXSvY14V", "voter": "0x58E603d9824976F7a3940C6B408F0Ffa523a216C", "created": 1605571350, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmSwBu9ZJ1QnxJQauRa3QKVh4xtcVKwSGktTX3WcHr48pT", "voter": "0x4ae901FBdB69eA08d63224964fC5E9696F0Fe6d0", "created": 1605570488, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmNNhfH8uUMRhV2mv84kb4b7U33kxHKCBpcNLSSaMox8Hc", "voter": "0xF5f08Ba7F46e2a86b5ef3BFD56c2097C9f4276D7", "created": 1605569673, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmYZQMVVdSjKFTs5uBJnKPtge9J1aUe9GJgpM1EY36vNwS", "voter": "0xf5428DA9FfEDB50115C4b6788027e895411c7c3b", "created": 1605569145, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmPGSDi4TynkSLddn3QWVBXHEKdbjBR5cRCk496pu83Sfu", "voter": "0xf7200f7a475b53446A10421DEa95299fA9319A85", "created": 1605568122, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}, {"id": "QmewLhJKyjqXdYmmmaGkXmD2KNs7YrVJDsKvSLfWD8Jcyi", "voter": "0x583dA21AD0c1171AE4B6CF24d92c46f033A0a794", "created": 1605557216, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "anj"}}]}
