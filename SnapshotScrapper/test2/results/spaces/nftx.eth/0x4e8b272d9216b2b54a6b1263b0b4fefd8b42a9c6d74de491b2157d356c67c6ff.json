Running our own node makes us less dependent on third-party nodes, improving the stability and performance of our nftx.io front-end.\n\nSecondary effects of staking GRT are potential yields generated by others using our indexing & query processing services. The acquired GRT tokens will be part of the NFTX DAO Balance sheet.\n\nFunds used to acquire GRT will be raised from the partial sale of our existing xSUSHI balance.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe NFTX marketplace uses the Graph to query data that powers the front end including the vaults, holdings, and prices. The site currently uses a shared hosting solution for these requests which is being phased out by The Graph in favor of decentralized solutions. Whenever these endpoints become unavailable, the data required to display the vaults, NFTs, staked positions, and coins are unavailable. While we have a caching layer to help, the cached version is stale and won\u2019t necessarily reflect the current status of the blockchain.\n\nBy creating a Graph Indexer and being part of the decentralized infrastructure we can ensure that we always have an endpoint available for our front-end product requirements and avoid any potential downtime for the users of our app. We will also be providing a query endpoint for anyone who wants to build other products upon the NFTX protocol making this easier to set up. Finally, we will be contributing to the wider community because along with the NFTX subgraph we will be indexing Sushi Exchange, EIP721, and EIP1155 subgraphs which other non-related projects can use to support their products.\n\nWhile this could be considered philanthropic, staking the GRT against these subgraphs and contributing to the decentralized nodes will be earning GRT from other Graph users and provide an additional revenue stream for the DAO. Initially, the pricing for use will be targeted towards covering the infrastructure costs of the nodes and reviewed in the future if additional revenue should be incorporated into the cost of queries.\n\n# Effect\n\n## Opportunity\n\n* Operating our own node as NFTX makes us less dependent on third parties, further decentralizing the products we\u2019re offering.\n* Our node may be used by any other third party, generating yield from query fees, indexing rewards, and rebates.\n* GRT may go up in price over time\n\n## Risk\n\n* GRT may go down in price over time\n\n# Specifications\n\nAcquiring GRT will be done from open markets. The specific way this is done is not shared in advance to prevent frontrunning.\n\n# Funding request - Yes - Implementation Requires Funding\n\nIn order to acquire 100K GRT, we will require funds from the DAO treasury based on the market value of GRT during the acquisition phase.\n\nWe estimate the total cost to lay between 100K & 200K USD, based on the time this proposal takes to pass. If this proposal is to pass, this is funded by using part of our xSushi holdings.\n\n# Communication\n\n* Forums: https://forum.nftx.org/t/draft-proposal-xip-12-acquire-stake-grt-to-provide-indexing-query-services-for-nftx/279/1\n* Deep dive Indexing: https://thegraph.com/docs/indexing\n\n# Quorum\n\n* Minimum Quorum: More than 10% of circulating, non-treasury NFTX must participate for a proposal to Pass.\n* Passing Threshold: More than 50% of voting tokens must vote FOR for the XIP to Pass.
