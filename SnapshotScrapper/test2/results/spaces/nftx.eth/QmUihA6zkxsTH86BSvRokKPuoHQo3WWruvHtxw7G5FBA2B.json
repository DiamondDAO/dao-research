Making sure that respect remains mutual throughout the growth of the NFTX community will contribute to avoiding internal conflicts as much as possible. I believe respect is a framework upon which a DAO should be built. If this can improve workflow, the earlier it is implemented the better it is for the DAO.\n\n**Effect**\n\nImproves brand value as people know what to expect when interacting with the DAO. Members are not afraid to become contributors and behavior is optimized as less time is lost to arguments.\n\nCensorship is always a risk. I doubt this will occur but should always remain a concern moving forward.\n\n**Specifications**\n\n- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other individuals\n- Being respectful of differing opinions and perspectives.\n- Giving and accepting constructive feedback kindly.\n- Accountability for ones mistakes\n- Focusing on what is best for the DAO and not on individuals.\n- Act towards having an engaged, inclusive and diverse community of users/contributors/builders\n- Publishing private information pertaining to anything without explicit permission. This includes physical and digital addresses.\n- Follow discord rules\n- APPLIES EVERYWHERE when using an NFTX hosted medium of communication (discourse, discord, twitter, etc.)\n\n**Contact**\n\n- https://forum.nftx.org/t/adopt-code-of-conduct/33\n- https://discord.com/invite/5ygF8rxdYR\n\n**Poll**\n\n- Yes : Implement Code of Conduct\n- No : Disregard Code of Conduct", "choices": ["Yes : Implement Code of Conduct ", "No : Disregard Code of Conduct"], "start": 1610190000, "end": 1610362800, "snapshot": "11620589", "state": "closed", "author": "0x951160D731822d141509c7C899Dc5A9C9237d4cf", "space": {"id": "nftx.eth", "name": "NFTX"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmW8CYWPcLFKtGQWhmJToDoY4zS1sYTWYQCdT3zEPhHsX1", "voter": "0x11c9A7BC7dc20859f04408166c0aF218D5cadC00", "created": 1610354389, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nftx.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXUW4LWNGPWtNXo7u75pqNiibuxMJHW3pNtiNt9SwdWD7", "voter": "0x4eAc46c2472b32dc7158110825A7443D35a90168", "created": 1610303640, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nftx.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcJxMmnVrAExrtVarBAG16dWmz4gkFNEvAG6aSVDHeehg", "voter": "0x30602250c5f1fcbA5407E99B1DFaAB992EA4fFD2", "created": 1610284241, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nftx.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZBAjtpGKUsmrjMFnNNp51h7XVFVZzfeumvPD1ABq5eEL", "voter": "0x356Ad8E7824c7B16b5E1903E6edF02E89138dc5c", "created": 1610243253, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nftx.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZcahRb3gXaxtphkZ4mTuPLvXGNbURtnBggEpn1gKP5mp", "voter": "0x701f373Df763308D96d8537822e8f9B2bAe4E847", "created": 1610224053, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nftx.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfRBFEw8j7u4MQ5vcDyzpwNHLAFzhdqKXmaJJiPhpGC1a", "voter": "0xC3CCcD846C3ccBac89ceE0D990dC2CAd8Ae55fDC", "created": 1610205503, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nftx.eth"}}]}
