The outcome of this vote will not prevent the DAO from providing additional liquidity on other exchanges in the future.\n\n## Background\n\nThe NFTX DAO has seen some great success in its community raise, collecting over 1000 high-value NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) alongside more than 2000 ETH in return for NFTX governance tokens.\n\nNFTX builds an ecosystem of NFT-backed index funds for investors that want to gain exposure to the digital collectibles industry, without having to be an expert on individual collectibles.\n\nWe want to bootstrap this mission by acting as the main liquidity provider (LP) for NFTX index funds, as well as the governance token.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe AMM on which we\u2019ve provided our original liquidity (Uniswap for NFTX/ETH & D2/ETH, Balancer for D1/ETH pools) have had good effects for short-term exposure of the DAO, growing the community to over 1000 members (taken from Discord) and being featured on key publications such as The Defiant and DappRadar.\n\nWith that said, now is the time to start looking at mid/long term value for the DAO. As the main liquidity provider for both NFTX/ETH & all NFT index funds, fee accrual currently acts as the main cash flow for the DAO. Maximizing these flows without damaging our reputation & integrity should be a top priority to grow the DAO.\n\nI, therefore, propose to switch over the current liquidity of all 50/50 pairs from UniSwap & Balancer towards SushiSwap, with the main goal to receive additional rewards on liquidity provided through $SUSHI rewards.\n\nAdditionally, doing this will push the DAO in closer relation to the SushiSwap community & team, who has recently published its innovative[ 2021 roadmap](https://sushiswapchef.medium.com/2021-3e1f45cf86a2). As our main audience are people looking to invest in NFT index funds, being part of this innovative ecosystem of builders is a good bet on setting ourselves up as the primary NFT index fund provider.\n\nIf this proposal passes and we get the green light from the SushiSwap core team on being added to Onsen with our most liquid pair NFTX/ETH, the additional cash flow moving into the DAO treasury will come close to 470,000 USD/year (at a 4$ / Sushi price), including vested Sushi.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe 50/50 ratio pairs that the DAO would migrate to Sushiwap after this proposal passes:\n\n- PUNK/ETH\n\n- PUNK-BASIC/ETH\n\n- NFTX/ETH\n\nAdditional D1 Punk pools on Balancer would be closed, with ETH being added to the D2 PUNK-Core Balancer pool at an allocation of 5%. Adding additional D1/ETH pairs to Sushiswap may be done over time to increase liquidity for in-demand NFT indexes, dependent on DAO treasury management.\n\nFuture NFT index fund categories that are planned to launch in the upcoming weeks (Axie, Avastar, Glyph, Joy & Cryptokitties) would be set up in a similar fashion (all 50/50 pools on Sushiswap, off-balance D2 pool on Balancer).\n\nThe listing process, including setting the original ratios, will be controlled and executed by Alex Gausman (project founder and core developer) through Aragon DAO agent.\n\n## Considerations\n\nSome points to consider when voting on one of the options below:\n\n* The exchange picked through this proposal should not be seen as a final and exclusive choice. The DAO may always switch liquidity between exchanges based on market dynamics, or provide liquidity on multiple exchanges in the future.\n* Fees captured by being a liquidity provider will stream back as cash flows to the DAO treasury, which is managed through governance voting. While there are currently no allocations made for these fees, a proposal can be made by any DAO member.\n* As the main mission is to bring liquidity to NFTs through index tokens, a preference goes out towards picking an exchange that provides NFTX with the highest community exposure.\n\n**Vote Choices**\n- Yes, move current and future liquidity over to SushiSwap\n- No, keep current and future
