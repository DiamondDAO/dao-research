KLON tokens must have been in the wallet right after the tokenswap\n2. Address must send KLON tokens to 0x0 in the corresponding amount\n\nThe community must be sure that the tokens will be out of circulation, and that's the reason for burning by sending to 0x0.\n\nThe snapshot with these addresses will be performed, and the funds for the V2 refund will be used from the treasury (currently at multisig wallet).\n\nThe distribution will happen 3 times during 3 months. The first batch will take place on 15 May.\n\nN.B.
