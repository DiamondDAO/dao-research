Our community is growing strong and our products are getting known in BSC in particular and DeFi space in general. With almost $80 million locked across all pools, we are currently applying a 75% reward lock for the first 10 days. And that has been helping to maintain $MDG healthy growth.\nTo continue to keep $MDG moving forward in the right direction, bringing more benefits to the community in the long term, we propose to continue this mechanism after Day 10.\n\n## Proposal:\n\nWe would now like to seek the community's opinion on the plan below by voting Yes (agree) or No (don't agree). The blockchain snapshot for voting rights will be only for $MDG holders and participants in Midas Gold Touch MDG Stake Pool.\n\nAccordingly, instead of giving out all the rewards immediately, we will implement LoyaltyLocker and lock part of $MDG rewards as follows:\n1st month (day 11-41): lock 70%\n2nd month: lock 60%\n3rd month: lock 50%\n4th month: lock 40%\n5th month: lock 30%\n6th month: lock 20%\nFrom day 201 -> day 365: claim in LoyaltyLocker linearly (~0.6% each day)\n\n## Voting procedure:\n\nVoting time: Voting closes at 10:00:00 AM March 12, 2021 GMT+8\n\nSnapshot at block [5600000](https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/5600000)\n\nTo all MDG holders, please make your voice heard. Vote now!\n\n", "choices": ["A. Implement LoyaltyLocker", "B.
