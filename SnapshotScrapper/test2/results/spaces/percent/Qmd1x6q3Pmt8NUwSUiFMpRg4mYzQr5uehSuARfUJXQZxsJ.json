However, this is not decentralized enough and it creates a single point of failure.\nTherefore, we propose to transition our smart contracts' ownership to a multi-sig contract.\n\nThe transition will be done in 2 phases:\n1. Initially, we will transition to a 5-of-7 multi-sig, the initial signers are our active community members:\n@PercentFinance @Bluecrypt @cany @vfat @brisket @Spartacus and @pyggie\n2. Then, we will transition to a 7-of-11 multi-sig, the signers will be the existing 7 signers plus 4 additional \"independent\" signers from prominent industry thought leaders\n\nMore discussion can be found here:\nhttps://gov.percent.finance/t/multi-sig-transition/42\n\nOptions:\n1) Transition to a 5-of-7 multi-sig (initially), controlled by elected and rotated community members + 4 \"independent\" signers from prominent industry thought leaders to be added shortly (also protected from by the timelock)\n2) Transition to a 5-of-7 multi-sig (initially), controlled by elected and rotated community members + 4 \"independent\" signers from prominent industry thought leaders to be added shortly (NOT protected from by the timelock)\n3) Leave things as they stand, i.e. @PercentFinance keeps the owner status (protected from by the timelock)", "choices": ["Multi-sig (with timelock)", "Multi-sig (without timelock)", "No change"], "start": 1602414000, "end": 1602500400, "snapshot": "11033700", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4fB94CB25918Cbe62EC2ab80E3569492af59B8c3", "space": {"id": "percent", "name": "Percent"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmX5iEQp66BZUnsXmPuVBWwyx9qDRswEhQdNbu6GqLddSz", "voter": "0xAcbC130F93CF0dfD086c660Bf867c7d8eeAfA137", "created": 1602452261, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "percent"}}, {"id": "QmQg9RVetFBTRLphHgoueGzdETuXZAQUuoEXgakAJYw8LK", "voter": "0x47ec58D5704082527a90362a6293029d7Ed5fc4E", "created": 1602442377, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "percent"}}, {"id": "QmdtD5TKiJpicyPLAp3QgVsRQQv5ozLCkggL8T29iNUfaB", "voter": "0x4dd59CB04BD93ea15DBab4F50BDa3a35d55738DD", "created": 1602439203, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "percent"}}, {"id": "QmXS91FWeZa6xLS8gXwvKDQMNvFk2SbvLBFXicGLDZqEbD", "voter": "0x87616fA850c87a78f307878f32D808dad8f4d401", "created": 1602428615, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "percent"}}, {"id": "QmY5BYdUV5KBJyGKEEmKirWjP7nVCeyLKn34Gqv6Po8cM1", "voter": "0xd657860fC512EC2250A7385A353f599e3276FDDB", "created": 1602424333, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "percent"}}, {"id": "QmRBrnQmgZxATrvCmFdfgtDkfniWBhaPrzqvwVHBFYbpMo", "voter": "0xF940CE19B9Cd0B9efd586381b488cEfB75EB413F", "created": 1602423452, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "percent"}}, {"id": "QmbzTWZkJWTL1hseug1xrWwfmcPGxRPksf5vgRptXQyqFM", "voter": "0x537037C5ae805b9D4CeCAB5Ee07F12a8e59A15B2", "created": 1602422243, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "percent"}}, {"id": "QmRpMXvrXnM14XgKGEkJJD5LNc73k5NQvKFbSNqyWgktGa", "voter": "0xCB0B279369b3C00bB01F73470C333462A39e6aEE", "created": 1602421134, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "percent"}}, {"id": "QmUnhXKWw1fMQ4AaKeJs77GoEX9pCwUZGPfuZ5TDiDSV1X", "voter": "0x4299D864BBDa0FE3272da750F8F7E8757A8ef534", "created": 1602419138, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "percent"}}, {"id": "QmVBj7jVtK4wjC63yzC8Z92VpsiCgf4qMQreCkzTunaVyA", "voter": "0x6e61A82AB503fA43935a9968e302C32d12f17cBa", "created": 1602418800, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "percent"}}, {"id": "QmWgwxmbXsjUmBSGfbfgVaHbd6mVZGhQDJ5zWD5QK4Xm4H", "voter": "0xfEc2dE8D9e77214Cd219cd03C0e722D82b4DE541", "created": 1602415739, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "percent"}}, {"id": "QmX65XMmkM73Dy76LWQDdH2hUeasV8vnsKamDzPe9LMX3T", "voter": "0xB85263804F8a3761fE70339fd194816f21422f02", "created": 1602415215, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "percent"}}, {"id": "QmXHf3hG1ysXqUu5dxySXmrVT6bBRkJZdUsS3dRwtTqMbW", "voter": "0xB1c6CC46C7f16cb385A457E5ECee3E0646f58A68", "created": 1602414821, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "percent"}}]}
