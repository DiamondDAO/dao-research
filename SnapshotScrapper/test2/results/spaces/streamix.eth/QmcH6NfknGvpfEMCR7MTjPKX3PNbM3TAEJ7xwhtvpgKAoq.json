Despite this, the Streamix team forged new partnerships, developed four very lucrative yield farming pools, and drove more strategies to increase our token value over time.\n\nAt Streamix, we're excited with the current development of our social media platform https://app.streamix.io, while looking forward to another great year in 2021. With this said, we also want to reduce the overall MIXS token supply and aim to increase its value over time going into 2021.\n\nCurrent MIXS token supply: 500 million\n\nThis proposal aims to burn 100 million MIXS tokens going into 2021. To start, we will burn 25 million MIXS tokens effective December 25, 2020.\n\nParticipate in our first official governance proposal to better our community.
