We've had lots of interest from the community about creating some OCTO swag. \n\nWe configured a merch store with Origin Protocol deployed to IPFS, that's accepting OCTO, ETH, and USDC. Then put a call out for a budding Octopreneur to take it on as their own business.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/octofinance/status/1325460570020044800\n\nWe received some great proposals and would now like your help to decide on what's next. We were approached by loldefi.com (@loldefi on Twitter) and have also had discussions with the amazing anonymous artist who produces some of our OctoFinest memes. \n\nTaking on this responsibility of designing merch, having it manufactured, and fulfilling orders obviously comes at a cost to the person taking on the role. We've made the interested parties aware of such responsibilities, but have also stipulated that pricing is set in such a way that the merch is affordable, that they make OCTO a payment option for customers, and that designs are kept true to the spirit of OctoFi and our wonderful community.\n\nOur proposed merch store options include:\n\n1. Our anonymous meme artist running merch store at shop.octo.fi and keeping 100% of profits on products (all featuring original designs from memes)\n2. Partner merchant @loldefi runs merch store at loldefi.com and keeps 100% of profits (their designs only) \n3. Merch store run by @loldefi at loldefi.com, with shop.octo.fi redirecting to OctoFi collection on their site, loldefi keeping 100% of profits on their own designs, and 50% profit share with our anonymous meme artist (original designs)\n4. Open source designs only, where you upload them to a recommended printing service yourself and purchase merchandise directly from the manufacturer\n5. No merch at all, just digital goods like NFTs\n\nYou can also suggest different ideas via our Telegram Group at tg.octo.fi and we will include them in another OIP round if required.\n\nCost: Nil \nQuestion: Which merch option would you prefer?\n\nBest wishes,\n\nDr Octavius.", "choices": ["shop.octo.fi only", "Partner merch store only (@loldefi)", "Joint collaboration of both", "Open source designs, print yourself", "No merch at all, NFTs only"], "start": 1605783600, "end": 1606388400, "snapshot": "11282530", "state": "closed", "author": "0xD06777d9b02F677214073cC3C5338904CBa7894a", "space": {"id": "octofi", "name": "OctoFi"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmehmAniU8AoH6rXUnb646vyLFGz2xTVmdkw9KaiomWdfm", "voter": "0xDeAd911AEfFb8f36D429279e51be1F1E25628594", "created": 1606275790, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "Qmc4PrjxACGY3x3vcEH9diT3t4fnniXeniM74qQwUbaZP6", "voter": "0x0a69a94703f3399B43331E920Dbb4A36c5e236FA", "created": 1606216413, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmWZet4JakfT9b1VoPEEuR3osNBbhiYv2SQ4i5uUnPMPEJ", "voter": "0xa08F235264EC058333DBbDF2be8dc57751dC2210", "created": 1606132091, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmWwhBgWc5KD6enXELZ85B6MM4S2sJHMNkGaaYYGeUUkTz", "voter": "0x2Bd15640b09D148763C6B5EB84dF2Cd1B7A137e1", "created": 1606081546, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmZdHPL29h15ZX9bBDHRpFEvoYjG8dsDn8psFPF1x4ip1Z", "voter": "0xe9A2b1DC6cB6E3405dc69b7a8231281faeD651f2", "created": 1606068492, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmYHQxGmyfrp2hxt1qGB8p4VybPXVHDvaG3DKx7E1Ze297", "voter": "0xeDd83f86Bd54e19ea8809BFB47a891C9E1fB71c9", "created": 1605881318, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmTdkjqBsCWVQqCDoGSpYWUEmXCVg7nbmWQAi2Y6QXztfY", "voter": "0x9B7D7c4ce98036c4d6F3D638a00e220e083116c7", "created": 1605834881, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmWQsJL2dKxs86kif5VJrxEZqxmifUeKtMrZvwBFASdwNs", "voter": "0x63891e99CE710fE90BB91EE351e0e312250b443d", "created": 1605806307, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmT255Ya9oXRxgVTYpG3mSx13bzpYXLHvAvcmHvLV7fyF3", "voter": "0xA46e197ca6552bC98e98324fCD9a23A1cd0b028A", "created": 1605797293, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmSq32nRwVqUWPZfU1L3hdLp7gC6kSrgLFyKqPJ1S8NHrE", "voter": "0x7a2611B4b14D14c6d57C39daC5B02cb15Ef5Eef6", "created": 1605795855, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmYMGcmJVhYQ9aMveAYhYTSgFF2xwLdy1mWHvPhpR6jRfM", "voter": "0x2b15E377502B491D93F1fB1A6a1B17714C739158", "created": 1605795414, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "Qmaieps4YzF1oMYjhqZQJp7wfGFMTd2NpVgJQtgUe4imJ6", "voter": "0x65c1425BF0067D3855B72Da10B2040c2E4942675", "created": 1605792927, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}]}
