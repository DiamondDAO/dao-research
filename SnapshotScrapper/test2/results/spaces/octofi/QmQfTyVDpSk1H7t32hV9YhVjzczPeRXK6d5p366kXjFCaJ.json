Octonauts wrap their tentacles around every opportunity and nothing is beyond our reach.\n\nTo show our appreciation for all the strong tentacles out there, we'd like to propose a ranking system for OCTO holders. Depending on the length of time you've held OCTO, your address would receive a badge, as a non-fungible token (NFT) representative of your ranks.\n\nFor example:\n\nCuttlefish - 3 months\nSquid - 6 months\nOctopus - 9 months\nKraken - 12 months\n\nThe concept, ranks, and associated NFTs are a work in progress. Facilitating such a program could be achieved very easily with our Governance voting platform: \n\nEvery 3 months a snapshot would be taken\nA governance proposal would act as the announcement\nYou'd be invited to check eligibility (gasless) and claim\n\nIf you held at least 1 OCTO for the entire snapshot period you would be rewarded with your corresponding badge. The first round for these TentaCult Inductions would be during DEXember, marking 3 months since OCTO public offering.\n\nThis is just the first suggestion for fostering our community further and rewarding loyalty among Octonauts. Provided this type of program is voted in, we would follow up with another OIP to decide on naming of each rank.\n\nOur infamous and anonymous meme artist is currently working on concepts and drawing inspiration from things Octonauts already know and love.\n\nCost: Nil \nQuestion: Would you like Octonaut rankings for unlocking exclusive NFTs?\n\nBest wishes,\n\nDr Octavius.", "choices": ["Yes, and I want to vote on naming of ranks", "Yes, and there's no need to vote on ranks", "No, this is a terrible idea, bad octopus"], "start": 1605783600, "end": 1606388400, "snapshot": "11282547", "state": "closed", "author": "0xD06777d9b02F677214073cC3C5338904CBa7894a", "space": {"id": "octofi", "name": "OctoFi"}, "votes": 15, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdZ9vmr3RNbJ3HaBssQu9G2iiH7JPGMd1kssvQpsK5WfW", "voter": "0xDeAd911AEfFb8f36D429279e51be1F1E25628594", "created": 1606275877, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmfSWRvKPdvAYaM4fKQzf9g7vwzFkce33e8fYU6uSEunC5", "voter": "0x0a69a94703f3399B43331E920Dbb4A36c5e236FA", "created": 1606216391, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmVfe4aJgrPa5yLQH58JbZcc7Qmv2s4MrzsMyXa4kXXwEH", "voter": "0xa08F235264EC058333DBbDF2be8dc57751dC2210", "created": 1606131894, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmbQ8wYUKPQFTFHM9cxotajE8CFwpao1j3mimZVV2bQbfG", "voter": "0xe043c54fC2c8b9346D5ADCe8178512eC6C62d86E", "created": 1606086231, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmS1mwuVWW3rXn2ms1TUnysjgo3QsdKBZD93L8Y1YQCeKu", "voter": "0x2Bd15640b09D148763C6B5EB84dF2Cd1B7A137e1", "created": 1606081598, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmWZqxt2xb4wWHoxLahBZy8ufN62oj3Jjn82mNwEUHEvGm", "voter": "0xe9A2b1DC6cB6E3405dc69b7a8231281faeD651f2", "created": 1606068455, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmUaH6K9FdKRnhWn1EFJi1d7jQhq9enRDsj3d7PeR5ePf4", "voter": "0xd65Dee10AD86d7970b0d7d0051708d0cDe638317", "created": 1606016878, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmNx1ia4kBZpZ2eThbsdr1ChVTNaj8NpaCN22C2JfSofDT", "voter": "0x9B7D7c4ce98036c4d6F3D638a00e220e083116c7", "created": 1605835084, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmbawtM5NBNpH4Wj4ghBn8tRp5Cxw7Kkg1mxwdqzeDoFEX", "voter": "0x63891e99CE710fE90BB91EE351e0e312250b443d", "created": 1605806261, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmPqawmbErsJ4PgcpH1LFEfZ1QxZ7yEjsMB6BEgC6trUg6", "voter": "0x14501A4B3b7Fe92032222Ea0E91E3DD313d88b0e", "created": 1605805094, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmW8Bhz6X9ECKXbeMRYeVdnGzFpdZeupHdTYdc5FvBUsTB", "voter": "0x7eaFafb98F50E477A8D3015d0f9E0439f30121EF", "created": 1605799772, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmZhJqQ9wd8Y2vdvNcTbZpErnxPwEfn3KaUweACMZH4AsE", "voter": "0xA46e197ca6552bC98e98324fCD9a23A1cd0b028A", "created": 1605796522, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmSUrzLMApQtYSDRFgGumL3EJ5bmjJV5zA55FMav9FVmN4", "voter": "0x2b15E377502B491D93F1fB1A6a1B17714C739158", "created": 1605795254, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmNNbtQeBJPkhXyZLaarKA7jPGfFjeVLCkmpVU3FoCtRPX", "voter": "0x65c1425BF0067D3855B72Da10B2040c2E4942675", "created": 1605792775, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmNXTz4udMoDvzVZioYrGCxzrNnYZZAJCdEGX4Pi9RAVo6", "voter": "0x3a51B724Bf7BadF5E95e19A212658946999DF258", "created": 1605792758, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}]}
