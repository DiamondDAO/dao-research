These are often 5,000 words in length (or longer), and take me, on average, 20 hours to research, compile and publish, hence having to charge for them, in order to recompense opportunity costs.\nWithin the reports, I calculate and analyse all relevant metrics, some of which I have devised myself, as well as evaluate the project\u2019s community, its development, value proposition and future ambitions, plus its price-history and other aspects of technical analysis, culminating in a grading out of 10.\nAfter the reports are published to the blog, I also create a condensed infographic that is emailed out to subscribers.\nSource: https://www.altcointradershandbook.com/get-featured/\n\nCost: $2500 paid in OCTO or USDC, or a combination of both, at the market price\nFunding: Project Reserve\nBalance: 247818 OCTO\nSource: https://etherscan.io/address/0xd06777d9b02f677214073cc3c5338904cba7894a\n\nQuestion: Would you like to get a Coin Report from Nik Patel and get featured?\n\nBest wishes from Dr Octavius.", "choices": ["Yes, pay 100% OCTO", "Yes, pay 50% OCTO, 50% USDC", "Yes, pay 100% USDC", "No, please do not", "Unsure"], "start": 1602583200, "end": 1602842400, "snapshot": "11039592", "state": "closed", "author": "0xD06777d9b02F677214073cC3C5338904CBa7894a", "space": {"id": "octofi", "name": "OctoFi"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVR1oWCGMPsMJ3dvY7ZdUbeRLHnXJ7S9CgPKc1V1ZYmP3", "voter": "0x279ea740d755F0144CE5782f1A37CA75A0284605", "created": 1602832460, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmVpq1XyV3qn8rmPGtig8VCW2TDBJLKjNFuixSXC1UdqJt", "voter": "0xc57fD513C5904E6990b24054b13CaD3B2AD3e545", "created": 1602811112, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmawgN18ZQEguqShKMuagBmHBU6z6rNgKaJqxNKyB9QN2F", "voter": "0x691B8956df03191393F23a752bdEC58BB2B535a2", "created": 1602810328, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmfRVL5CnwHxpg4U8H5VDcNQLQoRZ6PPrs7vpWwwBAucKc", "voter": "0xd65Dee10AD86d7970b0d7d0051708d0cDe638317", "created": 1602807334, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmRphWnG1dGM6PSTcFhtmqtSTgGct64zixS9c7uRqxjMYZ", "voter": "0xB64485C3d3F162ccbF0C4C0FF10daC1EBa3B6da7", "created": 1602770958, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmWN2aAjynKUVdb4s5mUjnkFqnnwbYGjCTUGt3D4UiFjSg", "voter": "0x473596cE13C9E1a35d57C9fC95536A45096F722C", "created": 1602704929, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmbxCK8ocFxDtFXSkKzh5ZUmtvAvL2raVnzfHFFVqQ5cef", "voter": "0xd1F560e0CdB488CD0F646642b3247136ff12FA10", "created": 1602654209, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmdoGXz9X7rAiEVwJFynD1ZFP6FcAE5kQjKHz95zisbjZB", "voter": "0x9B7D7c4ce98036c4d6F3D638a00e220e083116c7", "created": 1602649195, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmNZ28iFVT2kyEcjeQeRK5V1CoMzqzjPJPGg1xKcvU8fiK", "voter": "0x9E0eE8CAD01A4DFc4167D077B0e5227E0090141b", "created": 1602604326, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmPLvAtzxWcu8zK8wMvJMRRbMzdJFZn5P6zNmQvA3hRjbt", "voter": "0xc2c39c154e2b94FAb588AAe69b940C32BF1C988b", "created": 1602586608, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}, {"id": "QmPCVUgSc7fQipWDTYDYcfCcGCM8ihgLAZAnyJfeXUdyS5", "voter": "0xff6FaBb6A11fA2B5e2Cd3aF9eAe4AA525A6fF072", "created": 1602586261, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "octofi"}}]}
