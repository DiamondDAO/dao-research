I love the community and the project and want to see it succeed, but we need to start allocating funds to bring in developers on a full time, part time, and temporary basis.\n\nMy first proposal is to allocate funds to bring myself on for a 3 month contract as the lead developer overseeing the project and any additional developers we bring on board. I've been generous with my time for the past few weeks to get things in place for this transition. A large part of this was organizing things handed to us by Doc and updating our developer workflow to allow anyone to contribute.\n\n### But aren't you already paid as a member of the Octagon?\n\nYes. A community member donated a Sablier stream of 30 OCTO per month to each Octagon member. But if I'm being honest, at the current price that is only enough to cover 2-4 hours per week of general tasks assigned to my position. It does not account for the time required to continue developing the platform at the level we need.\n\n### What are some of your goals?\n\n- Fix errors in core features\n- Increase user engagement\n- Implement feature requests from the community\n- Identify bottlenecks within the user experience\n\n### How will you allocate your time to accomplish these goals?\n\nMy first priority is to fix the Swaptopus aggregator. This tool errors out a large portion of the time and has done so since v2.0 of the dApp from what I can tell. This may require implementing a different API: 0x API and Thorchain are possible solutions. These solutions carry the added benefit of allowing us to transition to cross chain networks.\n\nMy next priority will be to update the interface to increase user engagement. The best way to get people coming back everyday is to put their list of assets on the homepage so they can check in on prices and their portfolio's performance. While they're on the app they will be more inclined to use the value driving features like the Swaptopus. To accomplish this I'll merge the Account Dashboard, Wallet, and Transaction History into the Homepage. I've identified several designs I'll use for inspiration.\n\nThen I'll begin working on performance issues, identifying bottlenecks in user flow, and adding new features to improve the user's experience. Once I'm satisfied with many of these items I'll seek additional feedback from the community through Telegram and the Den.\n\n### What about other Roadmap items?\n\nThe Octagon will continue to pursue all of these items with my support as a developer. Additional developers will need to be brought into the project for larger tasks and new features.\n\n### What happens between now and when this proposal is finalized?\n\nMy time will be split between this and another project for the next two weeks. Time allotted to OctoFi will focus on the Swaptopus aggregator.\n\n### How much are you asking for?\n\nGiven the uncertainty of the market, I need to ensure I have enough to cover my own expenses in the event of further downside price action and give myself enough incentive to the upside. Therefore, I've included several options below. This should be streamed using Sablier from the Treasury funds controlled by the multisig account.\n600 OCTO/month for 3 months = 1800 OCTO stream\n500 OCTO/month for 3 months = 1500 OCTO stream\n400 OCTO/month for 3 months = 1200 OCTO stream\n\n### How should Yes/No votes be tallied?\nThis vote uses Approval Voting, so you should vote for all acceptable options, which may mean voting for 3 options. If you'd like to vote for *Yes. 600...* then you should vote for that option as well as the *Yes. 500...* and *Yes. 400...* options. This ensures that the highest acceptable choice is chosen and prevents an issue with the general *Yes* vs *No* decision.\n\n### How can I discuss this proposal?\n\nI've created this thread in the Den for discussion and any questions you have for me.\nhttps://den.octo.fi/d/328-oip-19-a-3-month-salary-for-nathan\n", "choices": ["Yes. 600 OCTO per month", "Yes. 500 OCTO per month", "Yes. 400 OCTO per
