For that I would like to have a new seperate ECHO \"Premium\" staking pool with a much higher APR up to 100%! \n\nTo participate in this pool you need to lock up your tokens for a specific timeframe as mentioned below!\n\n15 days lock: 15% APR\n30 days lock: 30% APR\n60 days lock: 60% APR\n90 days lock: 100% APR\n\nThis way we can increase the rewards for long term holder but also make the ECHO Ecosystem much more valuable, because new investors don't have to fear a massive price move (dump) on their investment! \n\nThe more token are locked up, the more secure is the ECHO Ecosystem and also it stabalize the price! \n\nHolders can redeem their ECHOS from lock up instantly after the lock up period is over without a Fee. If a token holder wants to redeem before the lock up period ends he has to pay a Fee of 5% from his staked holdings. This 5% goes right back into the staking pool. \n\nIf you stake in the ECHO Premium pool you can also participate in the Snapshot voting system. \n\n", "choices": ["Yes, let's do this!", "No, I don't like that!"], "start": 1625241600, "end": 1625414400, "snapshot": "8810019", "state": "closed", "author": "0x205F75D85225B7f7D19eEd547676Ea4c3f1a8Bbe", "space": {"id": "echelondao.eth", "name": "Echelon DAO"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRo9fD8X5gHf6C12f4JcKgAeLuxSgdSGhmTQZpQNsKm5N", "voter": "0xf40C2fA57A147ce4662f730497e5bc0C20Fd313f", "created": 1625333820, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "echelondao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQaR5r8kgCBGBtrjE2uZcSj8vnT96bXEacbrsMHS9GHqR", "voter": "0x46025a74454D980589Ed1EB444af3156EeACA892", "created": 1625251798, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "echelondao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTSudwsme57UFC7GKQtn98ewSXqEHUEd7FjXKm1d4YCr1", "voter": "0x205F75D85225B7f7D19eEd547676Ea4c3f1a8Bbe", "created": 1625246639, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "echelondao.eth"}}]}
