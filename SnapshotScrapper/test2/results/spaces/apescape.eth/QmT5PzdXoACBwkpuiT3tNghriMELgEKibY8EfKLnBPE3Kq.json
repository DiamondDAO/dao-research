The problem is that they don't add value to the ecosystem, but instead only extract value by farming ROKT. By eliminating the CHAD token and giving its rewards to NTRO stakers we are still incentivizing NTRO minting with the benefit of adding extra utility and a moat for the token. Because every NTRO is backed by staked BNB/CAKE, by having NTRO locked earning ROKT we guarantee an income that it is external to the system, CAKE yield that is converted to BNB and rewarded to NTRO and ROKT holders.\nThis will increase yield for the NTRO BNB reward pool because not all NTRO will be staked there but all NTRO will be earning yield while at the same time increasing the yield for the ROKT BNB reward pool, making even more attractive to stake ROKT only.\nThis would also eliminate the complexity of the 3 token model (ROKT, NTRO, and CHAD) while maintaining and increasing its benefits.\n\nHOW:\n1 - Set rewards to 0 in the CHAD pool in the MasterChefRokt.sol.\n2 - Add a new pool with 5x for the NTRO token.\n\nPITCH:\nThis AIP aims to better incentive economic alignments between ROKT holders and NTRO holder. NTRO speculation is what brings value from outside the system in the form of BNB/CAKE stake and LP rewards. A healthy NTRO supply will guarantee a healthy balance of yield coming in to the system. \nMore ROKT tokens stake will diminish the sell pressure of ROKT and will increase its value, since they are getting better returns from the BNB/CAKE yield.\nROKT is also sold every 10 minutes to buy and burn NTRO so the benefit is mutual for both tokens.", "choices": ["Yes, we don't need CHAD.", "No, let's keep baby CHAD."], "start": 1620511200, "end": 1620676800, "snapshot": "7277620", "state": "closed", "author": "0x78A25eb52591E74aa4a1Fd53A6784DD7454dc185", "space": {"id": "apescape.eth", "name": "APE [ESC] APE"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qma5PLgEKrx1iiLvRT8tDbFRr53iPnZtcZQV4LPsdAmgjc", "voter": "0xce66C6A88bD7BEc215Aa04FDa4CF7C81055521D0", "created": 1620641389, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaAhH8jnuhspEJJpTLomTYWnnFyhDSdamZ9VrzS1v9F48", "voter": "0xE56A22dF1C9C7097F822c25Dfd397BFab0498f21", "created": 1620639031, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWsvurW3UAhopdARBbrgFi3zNZGPXGqGUrt6yk6d3dQ6R", "voter": "0xaD1B397F918d74EE6c3060E84Dd5Bf90Be8b9767", "created": 1620630170, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbnbkdDwTXJKcrYvjqggqx2pWcFftoAVFDcR8mpH3ZWWK", "voter": "0x04F8903666E663D7db4A3D0BeA009d8EedC3b94C", "created": 1620624776, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWe7ZwTb1PA1Qd6fpqXQMgXrQKYsbRcxZN2jJFbwfp9jW", "voter": "0x9dA4DDebAA10dE62e347E568b61f8469453B8A54", "created": 1620624618, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmctG5bp8391GvCLDbk3terFxWnyzP5huAunFUZN5Qhce3", "voter": "0x55EFCB188A7952755D06138F33F4660EEed31e39", "created": 1620623460, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVsznCq1znz8Qv5uhh4HHuXiKy9fRsvvPXei8gtSyoH5x", "voter": "0x6235b8165f250a5938975F4Cfe9719E8A2Cd0E39", "created": 1620607774, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRkZbYgF5WawBr1VXKBhdrMeTFGi9qDLWRGTZ9DYAfvpD", "voter": "0xE1fd1c0Cd70F72442f447a4482c5739C09cb7731", "created": 1620607685, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaVvMjVr434CyeRouNhxFkh3zwu8segz4Soi2Y9ZbtVjy", "voter": "0xe4a07272E6865Bd48c318a3C427460eFbd7E8142", "created": 1620594120, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRNNUjuLH72StapoiV5u4chNRYhEJd7e961avxUZWAa1v", "voter": "0x3eC4483CDB2bCcC637EF2C94e8F6EEEB8247823b", "created": 1620593693, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmejz9Jr5uA57RE1ZoPStf9yPj5HJ3wf5i1ANt78zLpdaH", "voter": "0xf3b8869C906f5C185084aB379DE0c607F23f4747", "created": 1620593208, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQahZU4fikVb8tmN7JbTKugG4Z4h4wwgGarZWygsKPQ59", "voter": "0x5B0E316ed1Df4305C4Db6a53f958415a494CD67a", "created": 1620593169, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPZKg3bds8QSKzq8bDeypBCWdEj498YjxUVj4WxYcocCm", "voter": "0xe5418b07f7842002D9d13e9DBb4C70C7666D750f", "created": 1620591756, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYWuQ8TBBwXXdCsgv11GVc4iVoj4K1t225DS2kKisTMc9", "voter": "0xcFC205f5B03305f67F0aAC2888564563fa42FC9F", "created": 1620590523, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR8gEwkxg5n9vSQShWPwrXzhK9Fm8U2DmHv9KFy6HZN6B", "voter": "0x81533081730C558BA5619151168Fa2619D4D966c", "created": 1620590368, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc5BGJ6xBpaVxrJQHum4bcVa5mfmkFhALVUqtR5ua9uyq", "voter": "0xfc00112b3A316b400bB9bEeBe5022f2EAA93338E", "created": 1620590339, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}]}
