This will effectively end the PAMP program.\n\nWHY:\nPAMP tokens were created to make long term promotion of the project attractive, but despite offering incredible rewards the uptake has been poor. The team has invested significant time explaining APEscape and PAMP with very little positive result for the community. In addition to the time allocated, significant ROKT rewards have been issued to a (mostly) inactive group of influencers who (mostly) dump their ROKT rewards, driving down the price. This is their right given the way the program was structured, but we believe the structure has proven to be a failure and so propose to the community that we end the PAMP program effective immediately upon a successful YES vote.\n\nThe PAMP telegram group currently has 46 members, many of which are main channel admins or other non-creators. While a few influencers have been solid Apes to be sure, most of the small group we assembled did the minimum, took their PAMP, staked, and continuously dump their tokens. Some have even left the telegram group altogether. \n\nDiscontinuing PAMP staking rewards will have the immediate effect of increasing the ROKT rewards for BNB/ROKT LP \u201caka pool 2\u201d stakers and for NTRO stakers staking for ROKT. In the near term this is a much better way to reward those who participate in APEscape. Apes Together Strong.\n\nBUT WHAT ABOUT THE REAL ONES?\n\nCreators who have held their ROKT rewards and staked will enjoy an immediate boost in ROKT rewards on those pools, alongside the rest of the community. Those who have dumped will not.\nWe think this proposal brings a clean end to the failed experiment of PAMP to the immediate benefit to all ROKT stakers.\n\nMoreover, APEscape needs the ability to directly compensate individuals for their contributions. This can be for specific things like the creation of artwork or high quality videos, or to reflect the impact and contributions of community members like our admins. There is a better way to fairly reward these contributions and we will initiate a separate discussion on this. \n\nPITCH:\nRewards should go to those who participate in the project. Ending PAMP rewards will immediately increase rewards to those staked in the other pools earning ROKT - including those earned by creators who helped get us this far and have stayed invested. This proposal works to begin the course correction of ROKT incentives, and opens the conversation about further improvements to help APE Escape thrive. Please use your Ape fingers to press \u201cYES I agree we should end the PAMP program.\u201d\n", "choices": ["Discontinue the PAMP program.", "No. They are doing a great job."], "start": 1620936000, "end": 1621022400, "snapshot": "7382125", "state": "closed", "author": "0x78A25eb52591E74aa4a1Fd53A6784DD7454dc185", "space": {"id": "apescape.eth", "name": "APE [ESC] APE"}, "votes": 19, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZzZGTph4BdY9jQuZsrWnmooNSBUXLMNxTvhdtxuw5bQd", "voter": "0x8b8F2c6e32715b7330416e3008430089f48D9662", "created": 1620999417, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXR8KhDt1JZCj1eST7jnsEy1erUBkVhaHxUXEVWZvyYVw", "voter": "0x55EFCB188A7952755D06138F33F4660EEed31e39", "created": 1620996055, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRk67br5ZY1qThxEKS6W2DLXx8JF2KHxqV2AKxDGQXJr8", "voter": "0xe4a07272E6865Bd48c318a3C427460eFbd7E8142", "created": 1620991641, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWicUmxJUAAJ9LLZV1cKAJJsGDFNFH7Q5wqyA1c4dpyVA", "voter": "0x5B0E316ed1Df4305C4Db6a53f958415a494CD67a", "created": 1620990216, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaogbWA6uqUnfvDqB4W7nDg2LL4vpTmZRvyjx7VubkXtK", "voter": "0xE56A22dF1C9C7097F822c25Dfd397BFab0498f21", "created": 1620988038, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZPsjWqTWwzAnrVa6WRCiJ595S5iWHFZrEe5X4u54p5Nw", "voter": "0xcFC205f5B03305f67F0aAC2888564563fa42FC9F", "created": 1620987390, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf5b6Y4dy1Q2R2PjWfAwovsbK4LQCphMenT5Ruxsr3tDr", "voter": "0xa19589838629837cc706E47EeCe55363DF02A190", "created": 1620987027, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPdrWRsawnyhx1j9M6V1DUztS3yU33b7THbUFk8hmja6R", "voter": "0x81533081730C558BA5619151168Fa2619D4D966c", "created": 1620978451, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcXaZMM7mdAGMzh6rfFApC7vbXMcvmhcqzK33AYCGYi3a", "voter": "0xb9fa53E4B891520858449008f1Cd5a4Eb76Dc0b9", "created": 1620976216, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQMKvHxPUqipEQrZ5KjjPntFNPGqzDKXahLq76BZrodQw", "voter": "0xfc00112b3A316b400bB9bEeBe5022f2EAA93338E", "created": 1620975878, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcESGumuxwAns5DcXBw62PoEYPy8kvRAWhpBj6BL9Spcf", "voter": "0xaD1B397F918d74EE6c3060E84Dd5Bf90Be8b9767", "created": 1620974806, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRacX7pDEzC59A93sxFyzEptWi5heJxThDDkz9fgVUBVS", "voter": "0xf3b8869C906f5C185084aB379DE0c607F23f4747", "created": 1620972470, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWig2xfHXn5WHKH1KqDL4wQQkf1n3Jipkz2vebgkkw1ZY", "voter": "0xE1fd1c0Cd70F72442f447a4482c5739C09cb7731", "created": 1620971139, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeWazT3cbM3A9Kn5igtAuDoHL2V3LDgftnnabut3BLzAu", "voter": "0x3eC4483CDB2bCcC637EF2C94e8F6EEEB8247823b", "created": 1620964447, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXJuyMYEh62NwDRZ3QRZsnhk9AXDg5ZN7iDhaDtedhZiZ", "voter": "0xecc61A9e97ddC200354b92981C9E2b1622a07e9d", "created": 1620953963, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXvwjwWjvyqZwgBCffURJGVA4Vi3J3tkamyp6mES3KfsQ", "voter": "0x6235b8165f250a5938975F4Cfe9719E8A2Cd0E39", "created": 1620949262, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcUcS1MpeAJGANntYNxCH7HMxmpCCDm7WPjHTE6Rp271B", "voter": "0x3F580C052e0c5BA97A55691930bC4ea06958668D", "created": 1620947584, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc62hRWbSj2VMMia4bLcCwzkmcFfhhpGsCgdf6JSgsTBg", "voter": "0x9dA4DDebAA10dE62e347E568b61f8469453B8A54", "created": 1620937393, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW99jpcJA8xhgTPkpxFhTKUaWREQjWM9NueMG8Z8GcxT7", "voter": "0xfD12a4E5f2BF6788B97B7460FC6178a914174e48", "created": 1620936635, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "apescape.eth"}}]}
