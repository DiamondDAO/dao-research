{"id": "QmNdHyvhcy4qvpBq85crQi6hRTSyQM1wdHNWLdTEj8jY8X", "title": "Ratify Baller Liquidity Mining Proposal Guidelines", "body": "This is a general overview of how the Ballers will manage the Liquidity Mining (LM) program for Balancer v2. For more information on what the Baller group is and how to become one, please see this article. Anyone in the community can propose a change to these guidelines by posting on https://forum.balancer.finance/. There will also be a monthly call focused on LM where the community can engage directly with Ballers (date/time TBD).\n\nThe Baller-only snapshot will be controlled by a multisig made up of the following Ballers identified by their discord names and voting address: solarcurve (0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3), bakamoto (0x176001586fF17ad625Dc387557631710cf485f72), jnapier (0x1b0308B1f1447F56f124788e04459fEfb3659E6f), justwanttoknowathing (justwanttoknowathing.eth), tongnk (tongnk.eth), and followthechain (0x9211E86E3509f6f635CDc3C137771d661B4dcc29). If a signer leaves the group, they will be replaced by a new Baller to be decided by a simple majority of the other signers. The only function of the multisig will be to add/remove voting members on the snapshot space. \n\nThere will be a 3 baller quorum on each LM proposal. As the group grows in size, this is subject to change in the future at the discretion of the Ballers. To pass a proposal, a simple majority must vote in favor and the quorum must be met. \n\nLM discussions will primarily take place in the #l\u270c\ud83d\udc77liquidity-mining channel in the Balancer discord. These will be ongoing throughout each week and the channel will be read-only to the public. Community feedback on these discussions can be given in the #\ud83d\udc51governance channel or the monthly open LM calls. There is also the option for a scheduled call to take place where Ballers will discuss LM issues. If such a call is deemed necessary by a Baller, they will make that known in the #\u270c\ud83d\udc77liquidity-mining channel and a date/time will be decided by the group. Although it will be closed, notes from the call will be made available to the community. \n\nOnce discussion is completed, the LM proposal for the week will be published to the Baller snapshot. This proposal will include a summary of changes and a link to the github pull request to reflect the changes on the official UI. This PR will also be used by the script that will calculate BAL LM. Voting will begin Friday at 00:00 UTC and end Sunday at 00:00 UTC. Changes will go into effect Monday at 00:00 UTC at which point the pull request will be merged and deployed to the official UI.\n\nWithin the Baller group, there is no official hierarchy. The duties of managing LM discussion, scheduling calls, writing snapshot proposals, and doing github pull requests will be shared and rotated among all Ballers who choose to contribute in this area. \n\nManaging the LM program is incredibly important to the future of Balancer v2. The Ballers must remain objective as the program grows in size and must be sensitive to any community feedback.
