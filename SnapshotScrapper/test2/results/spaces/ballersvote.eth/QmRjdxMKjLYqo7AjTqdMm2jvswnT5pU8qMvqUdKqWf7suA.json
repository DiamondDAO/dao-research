{"id": "QmRjdxMKjLYqo7AjTqdMm2jvswnT5pU8qMvqUdKqWf7suA", "title": "Week 16 Liquidity Mining Proposal", "body": "This marks the 16th week of liquidity mining on Balancer v2. The Ballers propose the following changes which will go into effect 00:00 UTC Monday, September 6th, 2021.\n\nArbitrum rewards are being introduced this week, and 10,000 BAL can now be allocated outside of tiers following the flexibility proposal passing last weekend, which can be reviewed here: https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/QmXBCp7H9aesjoutXCduHq9kDFtBkmRnZdgj2s9w7Yrc23\n\n## ETHEREUM POOLS\nRemove a Tier 2 slot from USDC/WETH 50/50 & USDT/WETH 50/50. This is to create the 10,000 flexible BAL allocation, as per the proposal linked above. Allocate 3,000 BAL per week to each of these pools from the flexible BAL allocation. These pools will now receive 3,000 BAL per week each.\n\nRemove a Tier 3 slot from YFI/WETH 50/50, allocate a Tier 4 slot to YFI/WETH 50/50. This pool will now receive 1,000 BAL per week. \n\nRemove a Tier 4 slot from UMA/USDC 50/50, DPI/WBTC/WETH 33/33/33 & MATIC/WETH 50/50. Allocate 500 BAL per week to each of these pools from the flexible BAL allocation. These pools will now receive 500 BAL per week each.\n\n## POLYGON POOLS\n\nThere are no changes to Polygon\u2019s Liquidity Mining this week.\n\n## ARBITRUM POOLS\n\nAllocate a Tier 3 slot and a Tier 4 slot to BAL/WETH 60/40. This pool will now receive 3,500 BAL per week. Note that this Tier 3 slot is temporary, we are waiting for all of USDC, DAI & USDT to be added to Arbitrum\u2019s token list, so that we can deploy and incentivise a USD stablepool in the Tier 3 slot. As of writing this, there isn\u2019t yet USDT or DAI.\n\nAllocate 2,500 BAL per week from the flexible BAL allocation to BTC/WETH/USDC 33/33/33. This pool will now receive 2,500 BAL per week.\n\nLink to pull request: https://github.com/balancer-labs/frontend-v2/pull/784\n\n", "choices": ["Approve", "Reject"], "start": 1630666800, "end": 1630818000, "snapshot": "13154246", "state": "closed", "author": "0x176001586fF17ad625Dc387557631710cf485f72", "space": {"id": "ballersvote.eth", "name": "Ballers"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmbknnbWhUm4eT5xVZ3NJA5gMVMyQZqMWQ5ownMi6rvXtJ", "voter": "0x7019Be4E4eB74cA5F61224FeAf687d2b43998516", "created": 1630761890, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ballersvote.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeWzNjWrttXWTV1BeoUBH2Bs5bFtpAuRwB7Hh6a9nzory", "voter": "0x1b0308B1f1447F56f124788e04459fEfb3659E6f", "created": 1630719277, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ballersvote.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeDh6CHdzCQAG6HvSr2GPJfgH1uJN7A94SjE4sCa6Qpxd", "voter": "0x176001586fF17ad625Dc387557631710cf485f72", "created": 1630694925, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ballersvote.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWYFdQrgJcLeKNp3v9NW2xndedFYwjWQUUa8voMdQ65P1", "voter": "0x3bAbEBfD684506A5B47701ee231A53427Ad413Ef", "created": 1630692530, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ballersvote.eth"}}]}
