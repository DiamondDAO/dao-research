The proposed value of 0.7% is competitive compare to alternative indexes like DPI, it's within ranges of the traditional investment industry.\n\nFor reference, based on Morningstar's research, the average expense ratio for a small-cap fund is 1.61% instead the average large-cap fund has an expense ratio of 1.45%.\n\n**What are streaming fees?** \nThe streaming fees are paid out to the DAO linearly over time based on the entire market cap of the Pie (ie: 0.7% of market cap over 1 year). The streaming fee is calculated linearly and can be claimed by anyone, anytime by calling the appropriate function in the Pie smart contract.\n\nThe current implementation of PieSmartPools already includes all the necessary code to activate such fees, with no code change involved.\n\n**Which Pies are fees proposed for?** \nAt the time of writing, the proposal for fees is only related to DEFI+L and DEFI+S. The same fee structure can be applied to future DEFI Pies according to governance.\n\n**Why not DEFI++?** \nBy only introducing fees to the underlying of DEFI++ (DEFI+L / DEFI+S 70/30) there is no need to add additional fees to DEFI++ itself.\n\n### Closing notes\nThe sooner we enable the protocol to capture value, the stronger the incentives for DOUGH token holders to actively participate in the growth of the protocol.\n\n![](upload://iaE5Hp2KtLxr1NIoi8ERwYP0WCf.png)", "choices": ["Yes, introduce streaming fees", "No, keep it without fees"], "start": 1605283200, "end": 1605542400, "snapshot": "11250231", "state": "closed", "author": "0x857e6FbB7518fe4Fc28667C5581C329f9A571B6c", "space": {"id": "piedao.eth", "name": "PieDAO"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQA2fGAYySeXJJbFBoMSHa2c7Q4Kn6otwHYErna8VtekV", "voter": "0x01e6fd0aE73D9194b19f9B376065577927A0D5f5", "created": 1605446772, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "piedao"}}, {"id": "QmfUS2e4RAeA7WKhTpjRGmoYQ3g9U4fx4rDQ6btPhbjhnL", "voter": "0x03C65618d9Ca830d9099B66bA6bd52A3B0344f82", "created": 1605428887, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "piedao"}}, {"id": "QmRymcZAJ4PjLMDsKBGMoHwHhhx57mHN8pxgXqhtR8qPn5", "voter": "0xD0190738C574436F994e436dE438a55c4aC7A454", "created": 1605412718, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "piedao"}}, {"id": "QmY4fRSrAbXAfHhoN1kBeA93CfgYLLMzh64zFn3oFyx3Ly", "voter": "0x2e96ED2281C3069C6AbeAe5D9560f30F716d44b5", "created": 1605411460, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "piedao"}}, {"id": "QmT8CMexttvikVy2Wo1E8BW7akMgnVHwhRCguUw59VyYmB", "voter": "0x05cD14412ccd74F05379199181aA1847ed4802fd", "created": 1605356313, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "piedao"}}, {"id": "QmT2BeXoKJ597S7nBMqbAG8kLsn76YrhQZvLMb4onVc984", "voter": "0x4929f4d38F2955649b5aa34343da04cf790B9D92", "created": 1605338752, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "piedao"}}, {"id": "QmZsiUgdHUsVDwFDGy7kmi5itdUJacuvfxAj88hcAXHMkw", "voter": "0x74C4623d7609F3eB2665aD32Ff96B44856b6051b", "created": 1605333969, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "piedao"}}, {"id": "QmV4k299NZa9AAVGskS5qJ5CEfCkTbaMWaHDi9Fa7a5VZQ", "voter": "0xb6Bc98F5D7F6CE3c0946f7675128ab673e6c5D41", "created": 1605289087, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "piedao"}}, {"id": "QmQrPJwNPgv4VUqJDFXXwqAJqGLYdyvuBaphZnhuZj8bGL", "voter": "0x80fcfdd18c0b83a1827f5964D4D1B214Db16aDc5", "created": 1605286162, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "piedao"}}, {"id": "QmQNEW9rDq9N58dCb4iCXoav94wvMbBzbxygnom5HgyE7M", "voter": "0x857e6FbB7518fe4Fc28667C5581C329f9A571B6c", "created": 1605283916, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "piedao"}}]}
