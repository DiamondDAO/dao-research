I\u2019d like to put forward a proposal for a partnership between sudoswap and MOCA. Sudoswap is a non-custodial trading platform that allows users to swap any bundle of NFTs + ERC20 tokens, peer to peer. It\u2019s completely free and powered by the 0x Protocol. \n\nI\u2019m excited to continue building out features for sudoswap to help the NFT community and provide a secure trading experience. I\u2019m asking for a developer grant to continue building out sudoswap for both the broader NFT community as well as deepening relationships with MOCA.\n\nThe main features on the near-term roadmap I\u2019ll be building out are:\n\n- An improved UI to showcase the asset being offered for trade (e.g. images of assets, verified contracts, etc.)\n\n- Public orders to allow for a more order-book like model (e.g. allowing trades to be made visible, open to everyone)\n\n- Adding multi-chain EVM (e.g. BSC, Polygon) support\n\nIn addition, I would also like to help MOCA with further development where possible, e.g. peer reviewing smart contracts for the platform. \n\nAs a first step for the partnership, I am proposing building out a sudoswap rebrand that is MOCA focused with the same functionality and zero fees. The grant would be for 1,000 MOCA tokens streamed over the course of this quarter.\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1624150800, "end": 1624496400, "snapshot": "15909770", "state": "closed", "author": "0x75d4bdBf6593ed463e9625694272a0FF9a6D346F", "space": {"id": "museumofcryptoart.eth", "name": "Museum of Crypto Art"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
