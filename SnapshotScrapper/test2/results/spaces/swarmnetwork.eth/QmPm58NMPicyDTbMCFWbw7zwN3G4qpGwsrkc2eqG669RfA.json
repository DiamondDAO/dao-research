This negatively impacts the agility of the Swarm Network\u2019s governance and creates severe friction which negatively impacts broad participation of its Members. We need to find ways to change that to enable larger engagement in the network.\n\nWe have been creating a new voting platform located at https://snapshot.page/#/swarm as a off-chain gas-less multi-governance client based based on https://github.com/balancer-labs/snapshot (thanks and Kudos to Balancer Labs!).This new platform will eliminate gas fees and provide an overall better voting experience.\n\nAs a result we propose to amend the SNC to (1) eliminate Default Masternode Delegation (as the new voting platform will not be able to include the Default Masternode Delegation), (2) reintroduce language on voting from SNC-2019.01 (esp. V.H), (3) differentiate a general quorum of 1% of outstanding SWM and one for amending the constitution with 10%, (4) other non-substantive, editorial revisions.\n\nThe proposed amended SNC can be reviewed here: https://docs.swarm.fund/SNC-2020.03-draft-redline.pdf\n\nThe vote on this GAB will already occur on the new voting platform at https://snapshot.page/#/swarm\n\nNo budget requested for the implementation of this GAP.\n\nThose Swarm Network Members in favor of adopting this GAB should vote \u201cyes\u201d (=\u201dadopt\u201d). Per SNC-2019.02, if a ballot for a referendum on an amendment to the Swarm Network Constitution is approved when the votes for \u201cadopt\u201d outnumber the votes for \u201creject \" at the end of the Voting Period. The Masternode Delegation applicable to this GAB will be manually taken into account by Swarm Council after vote has closed and published at https://community.swarm.fund/t/vote-to-move-to-new-voting-platform/3001\n\nLicense\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.", "choices": ["yes (adopt)", "no (reject)", "abstain"], "start": 1607706000, "end": 1608310800, "snapshot": "11426483", "state": "closed", "author": "0xd56c6E89DA9F6cEab903878b98B1D91CfE1024D9", "space": {"id": "swarmnetwork.eth", "name": "Swarm Network"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
