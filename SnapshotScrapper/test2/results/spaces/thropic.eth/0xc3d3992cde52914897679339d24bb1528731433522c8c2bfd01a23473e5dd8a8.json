Now, Sushi supports more than 13 chains (more in the pipeline) and has to do maintenance and add functionalities to all deployments. On many of the chains, Sushi is among the top 3 decentralized exchanges and generates solid revenues. Most often Sushi is considered (rightfully) an Ethereum project and \"local\" DEXs receive more love and support from the chain-native communities.\n\nSupporting many chains is a no-brainer in the multi-chain world we are in today. Sushi is already receiving some support (token incentives) from foundations for deploying to other chains. More importantly though is a connection with the local communities & contributors and onboarding them to the Sushi community.\n\n8.BIP 69 (c).
