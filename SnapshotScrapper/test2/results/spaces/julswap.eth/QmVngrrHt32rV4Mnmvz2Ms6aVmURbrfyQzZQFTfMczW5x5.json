(OFFICIAL)", "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m in the crypto market for 4 years, and DeFi for 4 months. I bought BNB at $1.5, sold at $10 just to see it go over $150. Since then, I have been spending my time to look for the second BNB to invest in. I found JULD few weeks ago and I love it. The $JULD model of increasing the liquidity of the ecosystem to support the price and value of $JULD reminds me about BNB at its early time. So here is my opinion to improve the ecosystem and attract new liquidity for the token.\nFirst, I want to explain how potential this project is.\nJULD token is minted by Liquidity Mining. It is the governance token of the JULDex ecosystem. Users holding JULD can participate in liquidity farming, IDO and other on-chain activities of the JULD ecosystem that warrant the economic benefits of our token holders.\nThe market cap is tiny, less than $100 million, but the liquidity and trading volume are huge. The Total Value Locked (TVL) of JULD is projected to be around 170-200 million by the end of 2021.\n\nSO, MY OPINION IS:\nDecrease total supply of $JULD token from 800,000,000 to 80,000,000 (to protect the benefits of us, the early adopters of the project). People who come late will have to pay more to own this digital asset. That is the simple rule of crypto.\nOur token price is constantly increasing, and we should do our best to defend it. If this proposal is passed, I believe that the price of $JULD will increase, so as the total market cap. It will easily take place among the top 50-100 projects of CoinmarketCap and Coingecko.", "choices": ["YES", "NO"], "start": 1613674800, "end": 1614279600, "snapshot": "4966677", "state": "closed", "author": "0xD6AE45ffa43Ad7AcC1C168769518e4B5A5B4e995", "space": {"id": "julswap.eth", "name": "JulSwap"}, "votes": 15, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSQFEFcvE4UeuMinDF1tg2Xp7qw2K36oa13v1ec7YXTF3", "voter": "0x2924795194b4267432B0fB47718655208F034647", "created": 1614272718, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmdk65aQaivhbmvx91SJFg2Zm3kjE5WU3JPxgcK1gdCMAB", "voter": "0x14e611b58B93D09ae02cC1A312A6Ce3d62DB7828", "created": 1614270008, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmascEjQuHATS2RgVjz1uPYytmNT7rQsqCBcoYdQVy16jr", "voter": "0x39091141Db834354528379b0771381270C8F6112", "created": 1614267229, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWoaG6TowYdwM9YmMmVc2L83Emmm5eQb8A4mbv8gL7w1M", "voter": "0xE52Ed5d32eb876246ba41931331f546b0884ff9B", "created": 1614263582, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRwRZ2TFsFWAnFoRuhZQZHxJaW62tyL7QM8jgazKb6XQ1", "voter": "0xCFA6C69c084C9575084D8BFC32855Bb4cED9a540", "created": 1614263109, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUqoassDNYvSSad4zPgGTwgkiYwvABDM76sNcCkKhVssL", "voter": "0xF995941b8d904A32A364E7B6950b72f7Fd48DC5B", "created": 1614257792, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWptoGLUmQv8uR5ZTF3ya4DGvGypjDbe4nuSqwbCEQ1N5", "voter": "0x83DaA2Ff9a83EEF12f16DEe62179cd5d0C94de15", "created": 1613755843, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZh1wKgdA77aAwq7fdnMenRaukBorbyT1F5msHb8dyiw2", "voter": "0x7dFa0B8CE212Ee6dfAbA2975821F081e5fe45484", "created": 1613729267, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTj5BqBcVstF4kKnn9xFZ7DbibDUPikqUmtnfZQM686ts", "voter": "0x096200e697BBa4877362765e058D3e2782743932", "created": 1613721410, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTnm1wNhqbnVW4q9Y6QyMWnf66v6PeQT3rZL5L7A1w8Dq", "voter": "0xb451ff91f2B5Ec58F3DcA4E2a9CedF7AeCB6308d", "created": 1613718930, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRTdpW8Ja43CzFP9PVdDJWihaFhwZS5iPctkw1oXm2CjS", "voter": "0x43c91Af2A1F95b4c2f721839A576A379cB8dD608", "created": 1613701220, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRpoXD3WG3bgukSZDNQV7e6AMoDTDn12FcEbTuGMC9MWp", "voter": "0x75bB708DF7424F61130081FAD146e16877A404Af", "created": 1613699815, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNkU2LaTdoS9yScN7APenAhmpscvVCkodYrJynQPisGWK", "voter": "0x9e9919a298d895533fd6EB42cb7644EB98e60be9", "created": 1613699065, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYedbz1NDKHhmtAmzw3Jzs1HuArJ2hr6Yh3Q8Cd3HHfM8", "voter": "0xE67109B45feD1A06F75Bf47b809851cF185FD1a7", "created": 1613685899, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXXsfkR9w35KwRRemoH3X2fGkjwrUM79xaVgpWVeXnQwp", "voter": "0x5fC92dF2b10fE1Ed02f1fcD2c4339D402617FCD4", "created": 1613679688, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "julswap.eth"}}]}
