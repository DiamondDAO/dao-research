Complex structures can be discussed on mainnet design.\n", "choices": ["Aye, simplify dividend", "Nay, keep structure same"], "start": 1636513200, "end": 1636599600, "snapshot": "13587456", "state": "closed", "author": "0x34CCCa03631830cD8296c172bf3c31e126814ce9", "space": {"id": "stndgov.eth", "name": "Standard"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xe7988fda12e47487d6b393c7ee4f1c3530084941204af503d01496fd54504bcd", "voter": "0xF425A57Ec73a25A3B1A08eA7F88A5c9e080c9ed4", "created": 1636577113, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stndgov.eth"}}, {"id": "0xbd44d31ed0a3ed5cb1abfff22c8b115133e6eae8b9863f642e32fb7baae92ea3", "voter": "0xF2D3E7d4926A7F4cE72d236702a29d1d23333De4", "created": 1636535646, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stndgov.eth"}}, {"id": "0x54a25276cd4dbf99d2847df3a45a62a5dfedd863a0614bdf3a489a4bc802a8c9", "voter": "0xac2C6aC3cC453e1f62758b4f5a5F6A19aCF7964F", "created": 1636535156, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stndgov.eth"}}, {"id": "0x274988573c95d1f88933b01c751f4e36568e8ea027d6cb9fb6c0a0984e31e135", "voter": "0xd2234E506862991ADA75f930c6D79B4236e3E265", "created": 1636534826, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stndgov.eth"}}]}
