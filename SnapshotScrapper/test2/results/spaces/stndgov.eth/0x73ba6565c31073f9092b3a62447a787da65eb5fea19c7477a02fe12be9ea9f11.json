Use it for investment with its value\n3. Earning fees on current and upcoming defi protocols(e.g. repayment from USM(MeterUSD), swap fees, etc)\n\nHowever, locking STND for secure claim has brought capital inefficiency where community has to give up STND's second role, and there was no incentives to reward those who keeps their funds staked. Due to this, I suggest decoupling the reward-bearing feature from STND by introducing xSTND to enact fee earning mechanism distributed via STND farming.\n\n\n### Expected Changes\n- xSTND can be farmed from STND and supply will be limited to 1000000 on each chain. Initial issuance of xSTND:STND is 1:100, a close estimation to current dividend pool APY ~1%\n- Community members are now be able to unbond STND anytime (from current Dividend Pool). \n- Instead, stake STND to yield xSTND and unstake STND at any time.\n- Dividends will involve staking xSTND from previous proposal and be distributed proportionally to xSTND balance like existing Dividends sharing. - When possible, make xSTND multi-chain. i.e. inter-changeable among Dividend Pools in different chains.\n\n", "choices": ["Aye", "Nay"], "start": 1636005600, "end": 1636092000, "snapshot": "13547941", "state": "closed", "author": "0x08E9cD21FcaA19Fc8FdEcB3d39634019b5bB614C", "space": {"id": "stndgov.eth", "name": "Standard"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xc8870e5bb46d625d0ae62f81dd7fef250f0b723510bb3808aec957c0ace2ecd4", "voter": "0x08E9cD21FcaA19Fc8FdEcB3d39634019b5bB614C", "created": 1636035235, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stndgov.eth"}}, {"id": "0x765fe3a0f403788c39a82f1fb76c34f1c148f4347aca1f52c9a57d1f5e8048ac", "voter": "0xd2234E506862991ADA75f930c6D79B4236e3E265", "created": 1636032153, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stndgov.eth"}}, {"id": "0x727cb99491033b14c9675caf252dc3a9a0233a5195123babb84fe43ecd039192", "voter": "0x44D95620B8199b983ba4f09cCd9838b28323A328", "created": 1636032129, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stndgov.eth"}}]}
