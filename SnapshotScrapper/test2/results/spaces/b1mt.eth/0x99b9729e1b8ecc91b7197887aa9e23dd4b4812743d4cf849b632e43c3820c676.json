Create app for Partners\n1 Million Token was born with the purpose of being a token used for marketing (after it was getting more utilities), currently partners holding 2500 $b1MT can post 1 per week in 1 Million Token channels (1 CMS reddit, 1 post on twitter, 1 on discord) however we are doing the whole process manually forcing to the partners contact with us directly and share all the time what they want to post. With the app for Partners, they won\u2019t need to do all of this any more, the app will check if they are holding 2500 $b1mt or staking to similar value in the $b1MT pool in The Kennel Token or farming pools in Yieldfields also they will be able to upload the contents that they want to post in 1MT channels.\nPossible benefit:\n    - More new Partners\n    - More $b1MT holders\n    - More LP in YieldFields\n    - Higher APY in The Kennel Token b1MT pool\nEstimation: 2022 Q1\n\n2. Trading Competition\nTrading competition will run probably every month (still to define) with the purpose of giving a prize to three traders who make the highest trading volume with $b1MT, every trader will need to pay a small fee in order to participate and the winners will get the 75% for all the feed collected (still to define and the percentage will change eventually) the rest will be destined to marketing, create new pools in different protocols, repay current pools, giveaways, etc\u2026\nPossible benefit:\n    - More trading volume\n    - More fee rewards for b1MT/BNB and b1MT/BUSD liquidity providers in YieldFields\n    - Fee collected for doing marketing, repay rewards pools, get audited and create new pools which could make the community grow considerably (depending of the participation fee collected)\nEstimation: 2022 Q1- Q3\n\n3. Expanding to Automata Network and cross chain swap \nAutomata network is a new blockchain which few days ago was released the mainnet. According with my knowledge they are developing a cross chain to be able to swap tokens from their blockchain to others blockchains. The purpose is create a 1MT token in Automata blockchain and integrate their cross chain swap in our platform\nPossible benefit:\n    - Being one of the first coin in Automata Network\n    - Expand 1 Million Token in multiple blockains in the future with cross chain support\n    - Having pools in defi protocols from different blockchains\nEstimation: depending of Automata devs\n\nNote: the estimation is just an idea, not a deadline.\n\nWhich option you prefer for the next step?", "choices": ["Create app for Partners", "Trading Competition", "Exp. to Automata and cross chain"], "start": 1636412400, "end": 1637017200, "snapshot": "12486933", "state": "closed", "author": "0x619d3FA3bD7CF497d9899Ccd4d7b5663Ff318e52", "space": {"id": "b1mt.eth", "name": "b1MT governance"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x48c2efae37645d783a5a7f69ea3855960cbf9a3ead3a05e5691da64df22340f2", "voter": "0xDD2A825f1E6399b9B19C09c40457A730F295aC8b", "created": 1636999152, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "b1mt.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc83d02a4c46eb45f11707bc4a8070840f06daff862901c4eddc26d52c924b570", "voter": "0xC27C7A099691b1a6E1fe733e68a69C8E689FE3ee", "created": 1636727711, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "b1mt.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb1daf9b706722aa2942db61a6aabbd1ae5c5a47c659a52f2b87e39d24fd18e0f", "voter": "0xE80051F313C594793e31c57A2A2985BBbeD61bA7", "created": 1636673630, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "b1mt.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1d779023838b4ce8d3677c7e9264ef7181a0e101c1173bd954b41b04a62cfc07", "voter": "0xF880c6C78F81CE2B604C21Bb0C60D3021A7E1C50", "created": 1636673528, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "b1mt.eth"}}, {"id": "0xab4427caf73b0419dc8d6905ce3532ff3ef997402929e35a6d74279ee2fae3bb", "voter": "0xB860c949A5fbE39731893bbfE86D6Df57C2851c7", "created": 1636673513, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "b1mt.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc54c19f6c7b111b7e9825f2900d26cd279b4be032f26a5c43362eab1a5038759", "voter": "0xABadFc79dBA92073eab548e31F98a2Ab0a62D412", "created": 1636673502, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "b1mt.eth"}}, {"id": "0x64cac937a2c22c22c388f20eabc8bcde425f3dab08b20f7ba4454cc3f68f718e", "voter": "0xb156aF35d96ee18C8ee98cf9da3Fe08a5844257F", "created": 1636673488, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "b1mt.eth"}}, {"id": "0x52e65f7e362a6b09f077606fb4a9401737de6d8e3e382b39382c66079af4e15e", "voter": "0xb8c7fCA90863D00E033F749B81aB816608F9EF37", "created": 1636478599, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "b1mt.eth"}}]}
