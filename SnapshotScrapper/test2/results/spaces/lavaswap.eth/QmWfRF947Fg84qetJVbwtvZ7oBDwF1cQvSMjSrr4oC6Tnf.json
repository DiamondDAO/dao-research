This one will be specifically about our future HECO supply and liquidity pools. We will also assume that any initial pools will use LAVA- USDT as that was strongly favored in the 003 vote.\n\niLAVA Vote 004 \u2014 HECO Supply + Liquidity Pool\n\nWe listen to our community and iLAVA will help decide where we are heading to!\nThere is currently 15,907,195.94 LAVA (HECO) total supply as there is 84 million that was previously removed from the total supply.
