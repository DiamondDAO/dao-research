This pool will pay-out 30% APY from the Treasury.\n\nIf this trip is successful the following actions will be taken:\n\nDeploy new Platinum hands pool with following parameters on Ethereum Mainnet:\n- Capacity: 1,250,000  SLICE\n- APY: 30% (paid from Tranche Treasury)\n- Lockup period: 9 Months", "choices": ["Yes - Introduce a new pool", "No - Do not introduce a new pool"], "start": 1634544000, "end": 1635191940, "snapshot": "13441319", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5C356190cd2aFd1806a151298e0A0001bDD5F542", "space": {"id": "tranche.eth", "name": "Tranche Finance"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUjqvDawS6hdKLoZhoHmWLFWKEqqA7hLQLgZXaZyLhMPA", "voter": "0xBAb27204EB80cb433334A4e6992Da81B0B6B49f4", "created": 1634950931, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV4hP9p6sxBk2f3GZhqaxsfgHVjeJtU3FFcgUAHSYBiQc", "voter": "0x7030649186fe8CE64bf175c286E07c534cE739f9", "created": 1634815377, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVkRQFd91rVCexh6bEtjJ4imSDbpDnkG2fyXr5EcsvnhR", "voter": "0x9be4a27227a63C567D1E51413B4FCb5F4d8bC25D", "created": 1634746876, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdN3vaR87V5iMzZsnUk36NT1nabj8oGKcLAaUG2FeVdCA", "voter": "0x55eE305d2d3039E82853C438a8c6AE47afB743A4", "created": 1634720502, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPWgGQkhNYQ8cPAnBQKsHRjQcNdTVHBmfrUahabPNRdFh", "voter": "0xc8c6c261bF200C26754664E0d55AE9E733444B19", "created": 1634718309, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdWZAAmo7Hx1fCsCPisDVHfs6vo8zhmTEGFnQauXPdY8j", "voter": "0xa403C80E06893eD7E4F36145219EF35b31f2F62A", "created": 1634684634, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmevEyBZRmvprhTDjEEpLwreScymuaJSeGtsb7Fk6eFufB", "voter": "0x1431931098713A6065EEf3094F3433af9BCF8ac4", "created": 1634630205, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ6Yw1CLUNqgaZdLXnPFHHyxtsd5hAuV3gUoqi9LBNxFg", "voter": "0x742dE80a88c47E6158E2b9343B11CcC4780DE3e1", "created": 1634615562, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaWotuZRfUkmeuZZD1oDP5zaALopXZ4ta9ZvE3KfrqR1d", "voter": "0xC2aF0d3Af27C88820246a2a16b435E13FD5658c2", "created": 1634609971, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}]}
