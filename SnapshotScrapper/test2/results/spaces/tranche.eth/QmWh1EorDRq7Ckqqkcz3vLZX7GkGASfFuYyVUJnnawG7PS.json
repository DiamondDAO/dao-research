The current SLICE staking ends on Saturday, May 29th. The proposed time-locked pools would start on the 12th of June The introduction of these new pools will require that the rewards for the  LP staking pools, which already have served their initial purpose of driving liquidity to the SLICE pairs on Uniswap, will be reduced accordingly. \n\n\u23f1Time-Locked SLICE Pools Rationale:\nAs we are introducing SLICE rewards to our Tranches over the next few weeks, we need to have more predictable supply calculations. The current SLICE pools issue rewards every week, and users are able to deposit and withdraw whenever they can. This makes it more difficult to manage the supply and set rewards and incentives for Tranche holders as well as stakers.\n\n\u23f1Time-Locked SLICE Pools Mechanics:\nThe newly created SLICE pools would have a specific time which the user would keep their tokens locked, and is unable to withdraw before the lockup period elapses. Each pool would have a maximum capacity of how much users can deposit into it to ensure the sustainability of the APYs provided on each pool. The staker is guaranteed the fixed APY at the end of the duration. Once the staking period elapses, users can retrieve their deposit and rewards and elect to relock their tokens if the staking pool has a sufficient cap. Users currently staking naked SLICE will be able to either withdraw their tokens or migrate their SLICE tokens to the time period of their choice.\n \n\ud83d\udca6 Pools proposal:\n(Name, Duration, APY, Capacity)\n\ud83d\udc8e Diamond Hands Pool -  12 MONTH POOL 40%, 1,250,000 SLICE \n\ud83e\udd47 Golden Hands Pool -  6 MONTH POOL 25%, 1,250,000 SLICE \n\ud83d\udcc4 Paper Hands Pool -  1 MONTH POOL  10%, 1,500,000 SLICE\n\n\ud83d\udd11LP Rewards Reduction\nThe liquidity on SLICE pairs on Uniswap is now at an appropriate level due to the incentive modules that we introduced earlier. The rewards that were going into the LP staking will go towards SLICE staking rewards and (SIR) Slice Incentive Ratio allocation. \n\nThe reduction will be as follows:\n\ud83c\udf70 SLICE/DAI LP Pool = From 7,500 SLICE to 2,500 SLICE weekly\n\ud83c\udf70 SLICE/ETH LP Pool = From 7,500 SLICE to 2,500 SLICE weekly\n\n\ud83c\udf19 TRIP #2 Related Actions:\n\n- Roll out the Time-Locked SLICE Pools \n- Adjust SLICE LP Rewards to 2,500 SLICE per week starting on 12th of June 2021\n- Transfer 30,000 SLICE from the Tranche Treasury to the Reward Distribution Address to finance 2 weeks of rewards as TRIP #1", "choices": ["Yes - Adjust the SLICE Rewards", "No - Don't adjust SLICE Rewards "], "start": 1622102400, "end": 1622268000, "snapshot": "12516615", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5aD3330AeBDd74D7Dda641D37273Ac1835EE9330", "space": {"id": "tranche.eth", "name": "Tranche Finance"}, "votes": 22, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmf4MfsfLVRRXRP96mgPPL2sJcMB8r11pxm62myHBGupaJ", "voter": "0xA99F9Ddd0B627e463e8cD8803eA868eC838Fe1a5", "created": 1622257281, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS8azTVnkJvBnapdvmk8Vx47a3w1VxhW797ksvwFbfa9G", "voter": "0xddAD0490d024B5760eED7653e8Abd084E34dbC33", "created": 1622256751, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTzXxzyAWcQJR7D6bqPNgx3ahnAZUn1tJbT6Wnr1cz8ts", "voter": "0xE9D3D5038630631BeB4cFAEde0F5dE1837C5A2e6", "created": 1622256740, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQxsANayMSnXRnE36VsC7Ta4brMeuA5ZKVAnd6zPXBwvB", "voter": "0xbf4FA14fa8b90E1b21788d3be0316ff2F56AA85d", "created": 1622256726, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTw77YezrUygEfyUnpmh9SoB8xTrPMzGCQXQFiefs61wa", "voter": "0xDf5df5Bd1975879B305322B03E210bF711cECbC0", "created": 1622256713, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf8aYGjXLdY8FkRJNhPtWHNqFES1qeA2UkDKfFrqjcU58", "voter": "0xA8D380DC7fcfe1b4769A023db35478028188B410", "created": 1622256662, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc5UcanNASTMg99FUQE1nUnPyDyAZb6hzxV2M2cRcJPu5", "voter": "0xAA9fFDd59EABb23c7c452c8eB6cd533855f780Ce", "created": 1622256623, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV4Je3xkMAH94vGwJAgjkVHiKEVkRKVfr2UxhmwMKgdGg", "voter": "0x43140434649259DBE450F8FAAd194013Fb8049b4", "created": 1622256476, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSUCVU1JmEnMKnjyMCXEp5beYbt85u1eYefoy3MAzBouX", "voter": "0x4BA4EA05d996AB810884A6Bf34029598c6DD10A4", "created": 1622256461, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma9C8KSB717YgQJXC8EWuhZH5y63QDdFJv35YhLV1hCCb", "voter": "0x663a9B6958fdC5Be8750449709B38322bDd63951", "created": 1622254273, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRpcUWAVHbNUXkYEAhjKH8MA3wvTMg4QhFBxpTvbcuTRg", "voter": "0x20E853e5C6CC5C7e7892B2CE24630842cF94D783", "created": 1622254245, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcXTRBzBzfPD68ebkdFZAiSwsU1pB5ebCswJztCNpwbiX", "voter": "0xc8c6c261bF200C26754664E0d55AE9E733444B19", "created": 1622254229, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdMrdsAPsaKvnicH3jvKdQmQ2pJF9VzwvSifGXeJKpYd6", "voter": "0xe9079F35aa16f214bd48eb073Fec03BaAeE52c86", "created": 1622254046, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTFQoeV4PCJfwbNP4ky9iRpH2ef7mgd3cSYURJSPo2eXY", "voter": "0x26FF54a4EB98909bce179D2e2Bc864517636Ec90", "created": 1622185495, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPZ5eNMtSQz3F56rE5W2hRKbZ5pmqZh7yifREKTd6tMth", "voter": "0x34eA15e741E5fa055cdD261607ee5b3d2B7A34Aa", "created": 1622184462, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZoZCRBEao434R7meJdXy5VUQwSYPqon3vMaB3XvUK2JL", "voter": "0x57222D8e9a86F8c5fF65345Cf2e93d4303C466bF", "created": 1622181032, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRby8A7bmPW289ghGcGYFfk1MN2nqsukmkasBk1jaBJpf", "voter": "0x689a0591ef9Ad3A573c4B58678573bF66d54a676", "created": 1622161531, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZSYoQ7a3AKjGF6TwiHJV4KMKiJhy7zUiitXCcWw1XWMy", "voter": "0x7030649186fe8CE64bf175c286E07c534cE739f9", "created": 1622161496, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSWuugpEVTQppXngRjG8mxDCQW3FmXxR7BRdk7e64rrP3", "voter": "0x9E357F33a11B0E17C0e18cbe4313e70467428E9c", "created": 1622141294, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW6WqvzMxpUgByyEVzBu7fL1CqjFfoAXLLHrYZWKRmor8", "voter": "0x94a613591Caf461Ac62A4AEf07811Cd26328a435", "created": 1622139601, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmahTBYsrSUsWT45hDbBSCf6qUfRyXgW53GJg7C5qKBwhZ", "voter": "0xab9Fa3912b20E5F83Add16A6923bDb74f5B06394", "created": 1622127589, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ1zVKF5DGPUsdCfTotC5RwT56XqtArKxCPqGLA5NxPh5", "voter": "0xC2aF0d3Af27C88820246a2a16b435E13FD5658c2", "created": 1622126949, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tranche.eth"}}]}
