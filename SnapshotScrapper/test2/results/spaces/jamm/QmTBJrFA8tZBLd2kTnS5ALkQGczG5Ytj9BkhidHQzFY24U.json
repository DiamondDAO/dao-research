The amount required to view should be set at 55 $FWB, currently priced at ~$150, or roughly 1.5x the cost to access in $JAMM. This is also the same amount required to be a member of FWB Season One.\n\nMore on FWB here: https://fwb.help/\n\nIn exchange for whitelisting $FWB, I'd like to suggest that FWB deposit an agreed upon amount of tokens to the JAMM treasury. The amount of this grant should be discussed in the JammSession Discord, with this proposal used to signal whether or not the JAMM community is in favor of whitelisting FWB.\n\nRationale:\nIt's my belief that whitelisting FWB will bring more views to the JammSession newsletter, thus spreading awareness of the posts and ideas presented in it.\n\nThis would be one of the first examples of cross-community token-permissioned access and a good sign of faith that this is a positive sum sector.\n\nContract Address: 0x7d91e637589EC3Bb54D8213a9e92Dc6E8D12da91\n\nVoting For signals you are in favor of whitelisting $FWB with 55 tokens required to access content.\n\nVoting Against signals you are not in favor of whitelisting $FWB or that you believe the amount to access should be adjusted.", "choices": ["Yes - Whitelist $FWB", "No - Do Not Whitelist $FWB"], "start": 1608620400, "end": 1609052400, "snapshot": "11494916", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5B93FF82faaF241c15997ea3975419DDDd8362c5", "space": {"id": "jamm", "name": "JAMM"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNqDcW2dCwzSQP4Yd4bQ6VPrt8zH1ehDyJFhqzgmLZJQG", "voter": "0x85c0c09570C955F6e07522E9ad6041716CbBb7fE", "created": 1608825695, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jamm"}}, {"id": "QmQ8s2t3kga8SNr13REe3XNBdRA7RvLY65nhnZqKfYjtMS", "voter": "0xf925fDAEA552d36a5291335941Ab7A046F960a80", "created": 1608725462, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jamm"}}, {"id": "QmeZAhdbQdknVkTfYCCNdASKb2hfd8pBwS49DbViEA57bC", "voter": "0x662d5d79849113A5403Af776210307a7c82a5267", "created": 1608704647, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jamm"}}, {"id": "QmSp3BA29YYnkSzTTbyFAekVg1zLdTCEooidsKYtG6eQwk", "voter": "0x10D6d2e343281D388291A3e02f3293AaEdA67178", "created": 1608693799, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jamm"}}, {"id": "QmdrL6eEJWYCeJ1KQR7UX74qomUfUAasiZUiMXUmPXhUz1", "voter": "0x5B93FF82faaF241c15997ea3975419DDDd8362c5", "created": 1608675378, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jamm"}}]}
