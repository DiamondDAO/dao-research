Scope for these contributions is considered open-ended, and will be defined on a monthly cadence with the input of the Nounders & the community. This proposal seeks to bring on three individuals with deep interest in the Nouns ecosystem, and a proven track record of delivering value on short timelines & at an early stage.\n\nContext\nAs part of their original contributions, the Nounders built Nouns.wtf, home to daily Noun auctions, governance, an exploratory playground, and details of the project and its motivations. Given the rapid increase in interest and usage of the Nouns products, we propose bringing on world-class design & engineering resourcing to help iterate on the future of Nouns.wtf.\n\nMany Nounders remain involved in varying capacities in day-to-day community affairs, but the demands of the role are non-trivial and critical to the success of any DAO. We propose bringing on a talented community lead who will help strengthen the sense of shared purpose within the Nouns community.\n\nScope\nScope for these contributors will be defined on an on-going basis with input from Nounders, Noun owners, and the greater Nouns community. Contributors will be expected to communicate their deliverables & timelines in a public manner at least once per month.\n\nFor the design & engineering roles, the initial set of scope includes maintenance and improvements to Nouns.wtf. For the community role, contributions include (but are not limited to) scheduling & leading community calls, internal & external communications, Discord management, and onboarding of new DAO members.\n\nExpectations\nContributors are responsible for documenting and communicating their decisions & output. Updates should be shared early and often, encouraging Nounders and community members to provide input given the shared vision for the Nouns ecosystem. Contributors are expected to be responsive, but are free to define the working style which lends itself to the best outcomes. The commitments will last for 3 months, or 90 days, after which point this proposal will be resubmitted to extend the working relationship.\n\nContributors\nInformation on the contributors is available in this post in #private on the Nouns Discord.\n\nCompensation\nWe believe that the NounsDAO could fund this proposal, decreasing the burden of project maintenance on the Nounders and increasing the lifespan of product & community development for the community. For this initial trial, compensation will be paid out via streaming payments on Sablier. Each contributor will be paid ~5.9 ETH per month, for approximately three months, or ~17.69 ETH over 91 days. In the case of poor performance, the cancelStream method may be invoked, returning funds to an escrow and the contributor(s) pro-rata based on time elapsed.", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1637388900, "end": 1637456400, "snapshot": "13650151", "state": "closed", "author": "0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937", "space": {"id": "goopsnapshot.eth", "name": "GOOP DAO"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xc3d102d2a92a36406cff3e358c5919398bf9a1bcdf9f8adc92e6c6526cecdafc", "voter": "0x2e81c9c176158d83cA78817BCc42341acF98dd29", "created": 1637451201, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "goopsnapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "0x6663e852e2abb6a299aa60d6a3781c3b5b91e6b334cf7f3bd52809dcfe3f2d10", "voter": "0x02a5c980029cB470Ac89Df2E2de1CF453aEE6558", "created": 1637449777, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "goopsnapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "0x3f7a214a318358598a074135a2eece44d21ceb363cdfb5b3a6f847c20d3d4101", "voter": "0x837800AC0Fa0aA50234D15E2Eb7d65059b7fF1Fc", "created": 1637445309, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "goopsnapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "0x5221e5bb46a109610804c9fa3a34efcfb2221981c4a9e88a413d3d7ff52d8761", "voter": "0xE72EB31b59F85b19499A0F3b3260011894FA0d65", "created": 1637438183, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "goopsnapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc4fe32d54aeb531e4299217507ebd726057f6c781261f098ee545d78da8bb472", "voter": "0x7F248e4301F5A16B2a8289989584A509f7157845", "created": 1637428727, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "goopsnapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "0xcd13a23404f80fcecfce76b060e063117802b722720f4fb5e5db7e66eacb3ea7", "voter": "0x879253B5Cc2B13bb976e075F0571F85454A315f6", "created": 1637424158, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "goopsnapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "0xee9c01a156f941fabb559092d942a91b74c3a28d0fe4cffc6c0b879ce99a2a69", "voter": "0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937", "created": 1637424145, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "goopsnapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "0xca1e0e5111545f0b9dae8c1e65e987631ebb53ba89a532bd5190170268e7676b", "voter": "0xF6F7a399405ca3A6434b390d0221353748cf1884", "created": 1637422206, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "goopsnapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "0xa1c06084d92cff111dceebb0c23aaa941d800ca8f4e70425f3fe9693eaee6811", "voter": "0x7Cf67A1A486D5716517A989F180112ba26D1Afcf", "created": 1637395026, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "goopsnapshot.eth"}}]}
