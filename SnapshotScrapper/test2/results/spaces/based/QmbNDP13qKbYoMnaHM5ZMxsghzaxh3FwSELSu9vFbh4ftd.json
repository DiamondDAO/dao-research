We'll also create a pool so you can earn rewards in $MUSE (our token) for your NFTs-ETH LPs.\n\nYou'll be able to deposit Moonbase NFTs in the contract and get ERC20 tokens derivatives (the token would be called MOONBASE20) for them, those tokens can be traded on Uniswap, swap 100 tokens back to any Moonbase NFT in the pool at any time, or create dutch auctions for your NFTs if you think they are worth more than 100 tokens.\n\nNote that all MOONBASE20 tokens would be backed by an NFT, no one can mint additional tokens, the tokens get burned when someone redeems tokens for an NFT.\n\nWe'll create a pool for MOONBASE20-ETH on UNI and offer incentives in $MUSE for LPs.\n\nThe $MUSE you earn can be used for speculation and to earn fees earned by the DEX, thus acting as a hedge against NFTs in the DEX.\n\nCreating a pool on NFT20 is 1tx that creates a contract (like Uniswap factory) so the fee is about ~$300 at 50 gwei, we would like to know if there is interest before proceeding as we have no funding and it's a 100% community project.\n\n## About NFT20\nNF20 is a permission-less NFT DEX with the objective of bringing liquidity to NFT projects and finding the right price for users, collectors and funds for investing into NFTs. \n\nIt was launched by 2 devs with no presale, our token is $MUSE and the distribution was done by playing a 5 month old tamagotchi NFT game, it currently has 760 token holders and market cap below $500k.\n\nConnect with us:\nhttps://nft20.io\nhttps://docs.nft20.io\nhttps://t.me/verynifty\nhttps://twitter.com/niftymuseum\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1611878400, "end": 1612051200, "snapshot": "11745216", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4B5922ABf25858d012d12bb1184e5d3d0B6D6BE4", "space": {"id": "based", "name": "mbBASED"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWQZHzCfZYk5K6a7czxD1KVSdNjGsTkfRruHBBkGcKGg8", "voter": "0xaFd07301D807CD091F33614EA24A798e64b9C561", "created": 1612020113, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "based"}}, {"id": "QmTizkA6FCm1eviMwNmnx4TpwBYL3o9W2HRGZeQU1o7BAw", "voter": "0x6C31a39242D945DA405471C92eB9367ae1bd8c4E", "created": 1612001109, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "based"}}, {"id": "QmZUfgHEP6mAeqwqGLuwWMFww9YTUGaRFRG1gZ7HkcTzFP", "voter": "0xD93E1404D732CfEA9F7d863C92Efe4e408857b7A", "created": 1612001055, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "based"}}, {"id": "QmbvGfmJKYPnpUTKtqjFw3fYyP5uzParG6UXeW2eMxWkum", "voter": "0x439001e00378ee142489f56C04895FAc01dc0BB5", "created": 1612001008, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "based"}}, {"id": "QmY4aKxuxHSAmJg6V3Zxk9aXpZQNgwsapvbGWWhdyWWUcZ", "voter": "0xb43A03A66C0C66268aa5Ba25Df0b8D9C62138A10", "created": 1611915023, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "based"}}]}
