Imagine where utilizing Moonbase is a norm and a default for new projects.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you have friends at SUSHI tell them to come BASED Discord demand #sushiswap channel because they are coming to Moonbase this week, If you can code build, if you have connections/friends/member of other groups bring them here.\n\nIf you are a thinker and want to really involve yourself with the project pick up the clues to fire up the Absorbian. Craft, improve, give your own shape and do your best to fire up into the space. With each individual giving it's best to use an existing platform to fire up their own Absorbian rocket that they have worked on, eventually one of us will make it to the space successfully.", "choices": ["That's very BASED of you to leak intellectual alpha", "Bro what is this?!"], "start": 1601676000, "end": 1601805540, "snapshot": "10982989", "state": "closed", "author": "0xEec9096aE6f84CdAFF6a86357958aC15B23578dB", "space": {"id": "based", "name": "mbBASED"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmV1Ff23TLAPF2UkR4cCvGEeTGvgTGJXvWBCzVm9AqgKHc", "voter": "0x992fa315B7cA2e0512992fAcbC172B96Dda6149F", "created": 1601798444, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "based"}}, {"id": "Qmanq65UkvR7N9jajPrkQkWWGGCKWZa2reiUWV3kicWsov", "voter": "0xef6D7ea4B0CBA4064B0eA27f480d14C886714b47", "created": 1601788421, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "based"}}]}
