I have an idea about BASED only marketplace and I want to know if it's based. We are only a handful of people on moonbase but artists are flourishing with new memes everyday. Based culture is strong and we all share similar beliefs for based ecosystem. While we all want our based stack to go up and lead the masses towards real De-Fi, we want to share based mindset with those who are unaware. \n\u00a0 My proposition is to create based memes nft marketplace and start living based culture on this platform. Nft marketplaces such as rarible or opensea is just full of artists and it's not easy for based artists to be seen and have an upfront representation. So I thought a marketplace for the based and only in exchange for based can benefit both to nft artists and mbbased holders. I'll explain the governance design which is beneficial to based ecosystem after reasons for the proposal.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Reasons for the proposal:\n- based culture has its own style and its marketplace must be unique\n- based devs are busy with dex so they don't have time to do it\n- based demand can be triggered\n- based locked will increase\n\nDisclaimer 1 : Everything here is an idea, I'm a coding illeterate but after reading countless of papers this design came to my mind. Blockchain tutorials are very explicative and with new tools interacting with smart contracts seemed fairly easy to me. So I believe I can build this. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Governance Design\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n   Since they exist in our reality, I think GHOUL would be a good name for creating based memes ecosystem. GHOUL will be used as ticket when someone wants to use basedmeme.app. GHOUL will be pegged to BASED forever at 1 BASED = 10 GHOUL. As start, I thought 25 GHOUL balance is a fair entry point to be based. For second my view is 5 Ghoul spent should be equal to 1 up/down vote. As voting has real world effects, one must pay for its vote which at above mentioned price 0.5 BASED for a vote. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, GHOUL will be able to swapped to ART which is a token that artists need to mint their digital artwork. 1 GHOUL will be swapped at 10 ART so creating an artwork will be cheap. Distinction ART - GHOUL will be useful for reading market metrics when how many vote spent, how many nft minted. Following the circulation is important in de-fi so these two tokens will help separating artist and voter interaction. \n\nDon't worry I'm not here to rug you, I'm a mbbased holder and I want based ecosystem to grow. GHOUL is an anon based holder forever.\n\n\u00a0Token Economics\n\nLP1\u00a0\u00a0 5000 BASED = 100 000 GHOUL\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -> This will be the initial pool and will be limited to 300 BASED per wallet. It's also my greedy part as I think I can get a little reward if this project becomes alive. \n\nLP2\u00a0\u00a0 1 BASED = 10 GHOUL\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -> This is the eternal pool. This pool won't have access by me or anyone else. GHOUL liquidity will be infinite. What good about this is every 10k(arbitrary) based accumulated, it will stake 9k based to moonbase (or simply hold) and mint 10K GHOUL with the rest(and reaccumulate to pool) for air dropping 10kGHOUL/wallet(with >25 GHOUL). GHOUL can't be swapped back to BASED. Once a GHOUL then it's based forever. \n\nLP3\u00a0\u00a0 1 GHOUL = 10 ART\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -> Infinite ART liquidity and with a rugpull function for airdrop GHOUL to GHOUL holders. It's simple as that, a recycling economy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 To put it simple, here is the idea:\nMarket buy BASED, market buy GHOUL, pay BASED for the based ones and increase locked based with every ghoul action.\nMinor ideas:\n- Since voting isn't free I belive it can build a sound valuation metric eg. if there is more than 4 down votes that art piece will be labeled as not-based so it will be shown in an other page. Also I think it might be better if there is low sellers of the week chart above because yeah why are we trying to make famous which is already famous? New artists could benefit this more from it. \n- It is possible for trolling and mindless up/down voting but I believe community will show itself and decide what is based or not based. Since voting isn't free this will protect from frauds at a certain degree. Or artists can up vote their own art- similar like purchasing an ad. \n\n\n\u00a0 For later, these can be implemented:\n& basedmemeshop.xyz - > for real products like hoodies, shirts, pins etc.\n& basedmeme.online\u00a0 - > for following up the metrics\n\n\nSo while we entering a new paradigm I think it's important to drive up based demand using all tools of de-fi and build a firm user base. If any developer wants to develop this idea I can give free access to above mentioned websites and communicate along the way. Since I'm a beginner in blockchain all kinds of opinions would be very beneficial so feel free to dm me on twitter @1candegen. Here is a sketch about how website might look like (beware of high quality) \nhttps://ibb.co/3YvMbWf\n\nDisclaimer2: Problem is I don't have a PC and currently using an android device to interact with web. It's okey I can use the computer at my parents' house but I don't have access to it every time. So if you want to support me buying a computer and build this idea, I would be more than happy if you donate and support me.\n0x0D31a9585B381A062F622BE8189F525889bC0Ecf\nIf I don't receive support but this idea is based and no one wants to claim it then I will work on it either way but it will slow the process a lot. \n\nDiclaimer3: My net worth is 2 eth and half of it borrowed from my mother. I pay domain with my father's credit card. I'm a sociology student living with study aid and conditions are little harder when you live with try/usd pair. If I receive any donation I promise that 2 ETH will be used to buy a computer and 1 ETH for expenses on the way. If I receive more than 4 ETH than I'll die ODing so be careful when you send your funds to a stranger. \n\nDisclamer4: Thank you anon for reading all, so now you got the idea and can't wait to see based culture living in its own paradise. If you think I'm incapable then go force someone to make this idea becomes true and we'll all be based together. I'm embarrassed for the last disclaim but it's life and I want to see world BASED.\n\nSo what do you think? Hit me up dm to go fuck myself or give your thoughtful opinions. Let's discuss at discord and you decide.
