Tax can be customised as discussed between projects\n\ne.g. 3% tax: 1% buys mbBASED, 1% goes to lock more mbBASED/TRI liquidity, 1% goes to reward Liquidity Providers (added to TRI balance)\n\nTRI provides 10,000 TRI (tbd) to Moonbase Rover\n\nBenefits to Partners\n\nIf you\u2019d like to partner with Trinity, you can create a TRI-TOKEN pool with your token. For every 5 ETH of Trinity purchased, you\u2019ll receive 24 hours of liquidity whitelisting from the protocol.\n\nAs a partner, you\u2019ll get to keep 95% of the LP tokens. 5% will go to the community member who referred you. You\u2019ll get to decide on the duration of the liquidity mining program and the reward amount. A portion of the rewards will be airdropped to Trinity Tower holders (see below).\n\n1. Increased Liquidity For Your Token\n\nOnce you\u2019ve been whitelisted as an official partner, Trinity\u2019s liquidity generation mechanism will be rerouted to the TRI-TOKEN pool. This will help the pool attract more liquidity providers as LPs start automatically receiving $TRI tokens as rewards for joining the pool. This is on top of the passive yields that Trinity Protocol passively generates.\n\nAlso, the protocol will create positive buy pressure for your token since it uses TRI to buy your token and add liquidity automatically.\n\n2. Increased Exposure For Your Project\n\nIn addition to the liquidity benefits, your project will receive exposure from Trinity, which has a passionate and growing community of over 1500+ holders that are ready to support partners.\n\nYou\u2019ll be invited to our Telegram group of active traders and investors to conduct an AMA of your project. This is beneficial because most AMA groups will charge projects between 3\u20138 ETH for an AMA in their group, which is an incredibly inefficient use of capital (particularly to a start-up project), given that most groups offer poor RoI and are predominantly comprised of \u2018quick flippers\u2019 seeking airdrops and giveaways. Trust us \u2014 we know from experience!\n\nA far better solution is to use that same ETH to purchase $TRI and create a joint pool. You\u2019ll get to keep your LP tokens and build initial liquidity for your project, all whilst gaining exposure to our community of long-term traders and investors.\n\n3. Social Media Promotions\n\nWe will promote your project through our social media platforms, including our ongoing influencer campaign with Quotidian Marketing.\n\n4. Invite To Private Group With Other Project Owners\n\nFinally, you\u2019ll be added to our private Trinity Partners chat, where you\u2019ll be able to network and collaborate with other project owners who are part of our network.\nThis group has team members from notable projects including Contribute, ROOT, Value, GDAO and more.", "choices": ["based", "not based"], "start": 1609549200, "end": 1609981200, "snapshot": "11578568", "state": "closed", "author": "0xA7D7Ac8Fe7e8693B5599C69cC7d4F6226677845B", "space": {"id": "based", "name": "mbBASED"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmR9LMmQCfwbKeAwfMTg6Cz9njwmSLXqimz9JE4ckek7Ja", "voter": "0x088fCF2Ab9bD617f2A0806f56D87746b77Af8687", "created": 1609927163, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "based"}}, {"id": "QmcGWSLFxqn1z8dhXVbPYBrGSzJXWfapGx3t9QTNE9dAxk", "voter": "0x01AB07010c2F4bf5971537669Cc19d5D8Cf320A0", "created": 1609877775, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "based"}}, {"id": "Qmb7CQ22QKQuS7etnFh8CUn2aZa5PKkyXSSJ72VKYnZKNz", "voter": "0x6b71a2DED86b4cAf125b9cA54288883550454C18", "created": 1609747009, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "based"}}, {"id": "QmdRjj35shkH95dmticgVFDfiXSPbGMSQtexZ7FPcHjRhL", "voter": "0x02e05dbBF4df5d17cb3A0140F9643fE68cc4Ae39", "created": 1609734463, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "based"}}, {"id": "QmTF8yeR83oRA1ez5TiFf6VYKMz48NM2pc4nepGPkTo1F9", "voter": "0x81b5Ec3BE3D9339299e56665D8206D4D28ECe898", "created": 1609713081, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "based"}}, {"id": "QmY9WnkvxnhQj3ecVr7q2zFKZEpGTqNYCEnjLNQLNsPZ3d", "voter": "0xA7D7Ac8Fe7e8693B5599C69cC7d4F6226677845B", "created": 1609653055, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "based"}}]}
