", "body": "What is Node Runners (NDR)?\n\nInspired by the recent rapid changes in the NFT space as well as Cyberpunk2077 game, Node Runners is a completely self-funded project created in 2020 by a team of anons. It is an open-source cyberpunk themed game, which aims to bring together both DeFi and NFT enthusiasts in a fight for the decentralized tomorrow. \n\n\u201cThe action of the game takes place in the dystopian future - year 2074, where corporate autocracy rules the planet. The world has become fully controlled by the top 0.1% of the population, while the rest have lost any hope to regain their privacy or free will. A small group of underground cyber-partisans called Node Runners was formed to bring justice to the world\u201d. \n\nEach player\u2019s goal is to become the Node Runner by acquiring Hero NFT cards, boosting their strength with Support NFTs, and fighting Villains in 1-on-1 battles to win their cards. The team\u2019s future plans are to introduce PvP fighting mode, as well as develop a mobile app in order to introduce blockchain gaming to an even wider audience.\n\nWhy Node Runners?\n\nThis project combined classic liquidity mining with collectible NFTs, and introduced the first \u201cNFT farming & staking\u201d model. The game enables its users to receive NFTs as a liquidity mining reward and stake those NFTs to acquire NDR. Players will also enjoy the gamification elements, such as fighting Villains and PvP battles. \n\nUnique Features:\n\n- Hero NFTs can be both farmed and purchased using ETH. Support cards can only be purchased using ETH. 90% of all ETH collected from NFT sales is used to buy NDR back from the market and permanently lock NDR/ETH liquidity;\n- There is a 2% fee on each NDR transaction, which is also auto-locked in liquidity;\n- We are in the process of implementing the L2 scaling solution provided by Matic Network to enable our players to \u201cfight Villains\u201d completely free of gas;\n- NFT staking contract is being upgraded to enable our players to stake NFTs from our partners\u2019 projects;\n\nToken Distribution:\n\nTotal supply is 28,000 with 45% having been distributed via airdrop to 500 people (25.2 each) and another 45% being locked as staking rewards across 2 pools (Heroes/Support & Villains). The remaining tokens - 5% were used for liquidity lock and 5% for marketing purposes;\n\nWebsite: https://noderunners.io/\nTelegram: https://t.me/node_runners\nTwitter:
