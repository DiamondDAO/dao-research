This reward amount is set by the liquidity amount among all pools. More liquidity = More tokens assigned to pools according to weight formula.\n\n- Pool operators relationship with xBASE is only incentive-BASED = Pool operators are entitled to %5 of the daily assigned reward amount to their pool which can be claimed immediately if wanted.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n**Personal thoughts:** xBASE platform aims to bring pool operators to play with two new pool reward idea that I have designed, could be an interesting thing to try it out.\n\nOperators are incentivized directly by the liquidity of their platform, pool LPs with xBASED and rest of the BASEDCOSYSTEM with the increasing interest will flow from a new platform.", "choices": ["BASED.
