As a part of the LEGO initiative, we, [MixBytes()](https://mixbytes.io), propose a great expansion of the Lido liquid staking ecosystem to Polkadot and Kusama. We\u2019ve spent months planning and preparing to deliver this expansion as soon as the blockchain infrastructure is implemented.\n\n## Full Proposal: _[link](https://research.lido.fi/t/lego-lido-kusama-polkadot-ls-by-mixbytes/877)_\n\n## Terms\n- Milestone oriented allocation as a long term motivation for us to reach for the stars\n   - For Kusama:\n      - 200,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting a 1-year cliff and 1-year vesting when Lido for Kusuma manages to capture 2% of the staked KSM supply.\n      - 200,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting a 1-year cliff and 1-year vesting when Lido for Kusuma manages to capture 20% of the staked KSM supply.\n   - For Polkadot:\n      - 1,000,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting a 1-year cliff and 1-year vesting when Lido for Polkadot manages to capture 2% of the staked DOT supply.\n      - 1,000,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting a 1-year cliff and 1-year vesting when Lido for Polkadot manages to capture 20% of the staked DOT supply.\n - Revenue sharing is to be implemented as well where MixBytes are to receive 20% of the polkadot and kusama Lido fees.\n\n## About MixBytes\n[MixBytes()](https://mixbytes.io) is a team of engineers, auditors and analysts, experienced in decentralized systems and blockchain technology.
