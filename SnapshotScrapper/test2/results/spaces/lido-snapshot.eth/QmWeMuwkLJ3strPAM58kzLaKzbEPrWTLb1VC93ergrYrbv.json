{"id": "QmWeMuwkLJ3strPAM58kzLaKzbEPrWTLb1VC93ergrYrbv", "title": "Re: Should Lido use third party cover providers?", "body": "Starting another snapshot vote on the cover, as we need to have the quorum for the question. [The previous one](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/QmRhYv5UL4tFbLzbrhn9UEEeHDoFenurv1BG1cKgJfrhLd) concluded mostly in favor of \"don't renew the cover, explore self-cover\", but only ~4.5% of the total votes have been cast.\n\nCurrently Lido has cover for 5% slashing penalties on ~80% of each operator's stake (every operator has slightly different numbers here). The cover was bought from the dev team funds for ~66.3 ETH.\n\nAs discussed [in the forum](https://research.lido.fi/t/should-lido-use-third-party-insurance-providers/757), Lido should make a decision around its next steps on cover.\n\nThis poll's purpose is for token holders to signal how they think Lido should move forward with the cover paths as mentioned in the post.\n\nDepending on the outcome, a follow-up vote may occur for deciding the implementation path.\n\nSnapshot does not allow longer-form text in the poll choices so expanding here for clarity:\n\n1. Renew Cover: Re-purchase cover from Unslashed Finance\n2. Do not renew cover: Do not re-purchase cover from Unslashed Finance\n3. Do not renew cover and explore self-cover: Do not re-purchase cover from Unslashed Finance and explore self-cover (mechanism TBD given multiple potential avenues)\n\n", "choices": ["Renew cover", "Don't renew cover", "Don't renew & explore selfcover"], "start": 1626537600, "end": 1626807600, "snapshot": "12844988", "state": "closed", "author": "0x00444797Ba158A7BdB8302e72da98dCbCCef0Fbc", "space": {"id": "lido-snapshot.eth", "name": "Lido"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPHtrewBnfEFLhbxRibSodLfAteVAQ54H1Cc7t7c4vPQu", "voter": "0x458075B1AAa3A9E24503786091090547116B5f81", "created": 1626709529, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "lido-snapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUJU3zSp7LDW4t6KWkigu9zNF1ozsK2iPPEHAoqd9vLCu", "voter": "0xb842aFD82d940fF5D8F6EF3399572592EBF182B0", "created": 1626708963, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "lido-snapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeofskZhWoMAcF72r1xwLVkui2F3WYTsMYqu289U7UNxy", "voter": "0x7eE09c11D6Dc9684D6D5a4C6d333e5b9e336bb6C", "created": 1626703957, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "lido-snapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPhv4Yv2VByFncDSCFjUAzLyZfbp58fxVSHkYDP3AZbf2", "voter": "0x9B5ea8C719e29A5bd0959FaF79C9E5c8206d0499", "created": 1626697065, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "lido-snapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf5VwFEFt42Mf76qZVCQMcgxoQz9UE2TMJrmaVgkx9pwk", "voter": "0x11099aC9Cc097d0C9759635b8e16c6a91ECC43dA", "created": 1626696312, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "lido-snapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ1AaEsHtasaSuQbCnEDcQpqYuCx3ux6cHep2YdWk1kjf", "voter": "0x9074485A2B1D4060B2cA3D808FD82e4629202Ee3", "created": 1626692972, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "lido-snapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXrUcf97MupfYjeajPofcxC2V5TX374PQQ49ECcVxMPtN", "voter": "0x43CE646a81824798CdfBB638c51231BA8C1E9558", "created": 1626604145, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "lido-snapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "QmekowpMiST1RqMnhtAVZNT81tA6vZ9ewswjJyB6uoLsJq", "voter": "0x6ae83EAB68b7112BaD5AfD72d6B24546AbFF137D", "created": 1626551052, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "lido-snapshot.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTFiD7X7xjE2Vmwjy8NX6ewG9waJH98ZcWxtabUpdbm5Z", "voter": "0xC24da173A250e9Ca5c54870639EbE5f88be5102d", "created": 1626551019, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "lido-snapshot.eth"}}]}
