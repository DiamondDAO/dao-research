Gold Mining Token emission need to be continue until 50000 GMT supply\nDetails will explain at community discussions. No assets will sustain such low supply, for being staying in low supply, need to create many supplementary assets to fill users demand. Like YIFI. **We may decrease more emitting rate. Somehow people need to get profited at the same time need to control  EMIT Vs PRICE ACTION co-efficient. Which determines GMT\u2019s long term performance. \n\n2. We are going to deploy 3 more assets.\n a. SILVER Ticker SVR [ Not fixed yet ]. Our plan is we use 50/50 pooling for SVR. Let\nme explain a little bit, if we use GTM-ETH & SVR-ETH pool at pre-fixed point basis which keep balance base assets ration between 2 pools. 30% SVR will be pre-sale. From pre-sale collections 70% assets will be used to funded 2 pools as on basis assets ratio.\nMore 2 assets details will be announce to community on time.\n\n3. We are going to deploy Non Fungible Token  ERC-271/NFT . We first start Dutch Auction Dapp. NFT Dapp will be live within 1st week of November 2020. Details will be discussed later.\n\n4. We like to declare 25% POOL PROFIT share will be distributed to ETH-GMT LP holders. Last week of every month which will start execution from the month of January 2021.\n\nN.B. Community have 3 options . YES, NO or NOT SURE. \nPlease vote on proposals.\n\nThank You\n@GoldMiner\n\u1e3eining \u0388state ", "choices": ["YES", "NO", "NOT SURE"], "start": 1602007200, "end": 1602136800, "snapshot": "11008148", "state": "closed", "author": "0x557b4cd961844F9548EBc9534B84D66fED1df407", "space": {"id": "gmt", "name": "GoldMining Token"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmamED6vEf1w6XaVx3ajziwgEWU93gWT3nYRcMK6UjMCdK", "voter": "0x84140c8AdF40098631fF5806BECF5c3eE9DDc9A6", "created": 1602081858, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "gmt"}}, {"id": "QmTHSW2xJyfEXFadHKLbX9tM7LASmPFqJ3HS7o7C9d41Py", "voter": "0xE8Dcf316E963249C20E3e7246b71D03A26e66F2d", "created": 1602076518, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "gmt"}}, {"id": "QmSsH5dgnBJQr8HpJC4cEBCyVic2Ce4ucukaUWXqsgf9BA", "voter": "0x22c45E251700259e291A0fBb0945E882B5171233", "created": 1602067349, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "gmt"}}, {"id": "QmUrkn2rggQUQpkPVe6ZVWiAiQZvtsCHVBYk46Y1UmN8Nc", "voter": "0xcF9c6CABF5f4d5A83705373Dc3AC142b07a9d5B2", "created": 1602061055, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "gmt"}}, {"id": "QmSTRBffJcawXfXLr1B4DsmHHFFtWx8gqjvFM3J5vjdEpy", "voter": "0x95893B247F4a3bCfb2cF50610734762d3d2c576f", "created": 1602054148, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "gmt"}}, {"id": "Qmbwd9cQaK4WPaTGX6159t1fiXk42Z3MyDpDdjYJT64edA", "voter": "0x23f9ec0Bd2BBb96fc2A6962dFaae345bD7dB878a", "created": 1602050398, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "gmt"}}, {"id": "QmPmAn5cYt3sTzmrQetPwJHHLkpXd5WrouHDyNGGdvfdg7", "voter": "0x7CD4F840074229A5ad0ef172Aa4A2114A75d0446", "created": 1602042379, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "gmt"}}, {"id": "Qmca9aYodrzMqCBL7meRe6CX72pYnK9DqxRFHuz362eWEY", "voter": "0x9CCb7e9670cFad7e8d9B9a8eC47cC98A4406D4AA", "created": 1602042224, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "gmt"}}, {"id": "QmVKaKztXmyRvD5eFB2FpJ7FsVWXFsaL2Y93qRKB4zwwpy", "voter": "0xe8E55b190490c91b8752E14B5AAf58e503604604", "created": 1602040794, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "gmt"}}, {"id": "QmcYLMi9HjKNeCr2gCHhxBi3UX4tt42p8e7bpUGF3uNQB8", "voter": "0x21Eccb2BB3a7e8f7518909BE3Df0f771307b8581", "created": 1602040702, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "gmt"}}, {"id": "QmQTAsNy1kdq74WvrkoJCaNXt4nfE5gpUHWupSmeA6fCtF", "voter": "0x557b4cd961844F9548EBc9534B84D66fED1df407", "created": 1602040669, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "gmt"}}]}
