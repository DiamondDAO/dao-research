(This could be about 0.2 - 0.5 eth to make things simple) . \n\nIf this proposal passes, we can vote for that next :) \n\n\n\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1602604800, "end": 1602950400, "snapshot": "11053150", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6DEebc6DeD7E4c8Ed2B7A5d958BE58fe29c6123C", "space": {"id": "d5", "name": "D5"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmV9hMh6PqfzxwaXdpo99oSoKLkrrobTN9KbwLeWW9FAQD", "voter": "0xB1dAB97636A94201881C8236056E733315EAeae7", "created": 1602682475, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "d5"}}, {"id": "QmW7w4h9r2NGi1QYHUwPoPxRAomHFMEZjRxAW9sf56KojB", "voter": "0x4a7C6899cdcB379e284fBFD045462e751DA4C7cE", "created": 1602673529, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "d5"}}, {"id": "QmXRjgiuZBEfiionvDWNUjz3T59Z851RrG8YtABkNMhzbB", "voter": "0x6DEebc6DeD7E4c8Ed2B7A5d958BE58fe29c6123C", "created": 1602671110, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "d5"}}]}
