Hence, we'd like to split into two separate Discords.\n\nOriginally our Discord was started by D5, but since most of the members are there to discuss Nansen, we'll have the lowest friction by having D5 set up a new Discord, leaving the current one for Nansen.\n\nBy voting Yes in this vote, you support the following:\n- D5 sets up a new Discord\n- A 250 DFS bounty is offered to the D5 member for setting up the new server, mirroring existing D5 channels and permissions\n- The [current Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/4MC6wXT) gets handed over to Nansen\n- D5 accepts a contribution of US$500 from Nansen so that Nansen receives full ownership of the old Discord server", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1605110400, "end": 1605283200, "snapshot": "11237209", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4a7C6899cdcB379e284fBFD045462e751DA4C7cE", "space": {"id": "d5", "name": "D5"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXjPxJMMfpYo9Z2e7mM8E1Mtjk4twuotHpphvH9Kbu1eo", "voter": "0xD20234E08327ef81276f7088EbA987153E7FFAb3", "created": 1605218392, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "d5"}}, {"id": "QmX9V3Vs6bnVovmDTshfZTuQBGfWAL13Gwuh8fazxPi2Gh", "voter": "0x6DEebc6DeD7E4c8Ed2B7A5d958BE58fe29c6123C", "created": 1605110875, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "d5"}}]}
