The more a user uses DEGO v1, the more DANDY the user will get. According to the team, DANDY is a rewarding token for early DEGO users. To utilize the use of DANDY, I, as a DEGO community member, propose to use DANDY to mine the dividend pool.\n \nDEGO as a deflation model stores token on the dividend pool, other events will use the dividend pool too. Hence, we propose to open the Dandy dividend pool every 6 months, using 20% of the existing dividend pool. We would suggest opening the first dividend pool at the end of May. But it depends on the team\u2019s working priority.\n \nYes \nNo \n \nKind Regards, \nA Community Member", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1620878400, "end": 1621224000, "snapshot": "12411835", "state": "closed", "author": "0x933057c1F2FD64814F42A773f5992e7C5465858f", "space": {"id": "dego", "name": "dego.finance"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSjtb2ByPUhLbHQRyMzgTGqL1EvpX4J7WD3h8JN6httPk", "voter": "0x3AF9fE35D280ADA5a5edB1BEf3ED872a3231d73C", "created": 1620991243, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dego"}}, {"id": "Qmc8c8oXMYStCMBDFFeMtqsaxXzJPFBLNfF1Mzm4fcyj4E", "voter": "0x933057c1F2FD64814F42A773f5992e7C5465858f", "created": 1620894861, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dego"}}, {"id": "Qmakk3Vz4LbazMnPBbqZq5CmqdJFiRnPvu5XgrFndwYmAf", "voter": "0x126887b39C9728D51A061544b29c54bC14649546", "created": 1620890846, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dego"}}, {"id": "QmNhyQhFgWqaMuPj7sDC7qnp3tAMQtMietFoenRitwDFGH", "voter": "0x0415A5DDb770A998d497b62f1f6f9CF316f88F86", "created": 1620890811, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dego"}}]}
