Especially blockchains that leverage proof-of-work consensus mechanisms like Ethereum require large and increasing amounts of energy to operate.\n\n### Context\nAt DIA, being a blockchain-native project, we are aware of the responsibility which the use of energy-intensive networks entails. As a data provider, we not only leverage blockchain to supply smart contracts with oracles, we are also in a unique position to estimate the impact that the use of decentralised ledgers have.\n\n### Solution\nEmbracing this responsibility, we propose to take the first steps to counter externalities of on-chain operations, starting with DIA\u2019s oracle usage. Leveraging DIA\u2019s data infrastructure, we are able to track the volume of on-chain oracle transactions across ledgers and calculate the associated energy consumption. This, in turn, will enable us to approximate the resulting carbon emissions in order to be able to offset them.\n\n### Benefits\nDeliver carbon-neutral oracle services to dApps\nContribute to creating a more sustainable DeFi ecosystem\nPosition DIA as an environmentally friendly blockchain project\nPromote sustainable practices in the blockchain space.\n\n### Costs\nTo carry out this initiative, DIA Association will partner with one of the above projects and pay a fee defined by the chosen off-setting association.\n\n### Risks\nWe do not perceive significant risks with this proposal.\n\n### Parameters\nWe have identified a number of potential partners that can operationalise the offsetting and ask you, the DIA DAO, to help us choose the right one. We introduce each potential partner in [the DIA DAO Forum here](https://dao.diadata.org/t/gdp-006-dias-carbon-neutral-oracle-initiative/81).\n\n- Option 1 - **[MyClimate](http://myclimate.org/)**\n\n- Option 2 - **[AtmosFair](https://www.atmosfair.de/en/)**\n\n- Option 3 - **[ClimateTrade](https://climatetrade.com/)**\n\n- Option 4 - **[Wren](https://www.wren.co/)**\n\n- Option 5 - **[Moss](https://moss.earth/)**\n\n- Option 6 - None of the above", "choices": ["MyClimate", "AtmosFair", "ClimateTrade", "Wren", "Moss", "None of the above"], "start": 1636120800, "end": 1636390800, "snapshot": "13556845", "state": "closed", "author": "0xEBD87c395fEa29C2f0e13e34548681267F0FAFe6", "space": {"id": "diadao.eth", "name": "DIAData"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x3e350271aca19debb8c95651b0aaf01b907e629aa94e8c47fe8025337999a873", "voter": "0xc129802eabec3f981e13e8268B073Fe252780FB4", "created": 1636185646, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "diadao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xeedd9cba420a2cc1f0828a8cbb6381a971adb554ab30dd1cb557c14bb1f50365", "voter": "0x8a2f4E83885CFe7F670eDecf9339635d7539B87C", "created": 1636185628, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "diadao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x33b1b342e35734965b7204765e3db009a308fe8c363e762a8b8bbf7acc28e5ec", "voter": "0x8037415A9560752bc0C1187732938b5775ee0Ec8", "created": 1636185610, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "diadao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x38a049c2582a7d589fcdae1cdae9a090540acf110b58ba0fb02d575dd4db4cab", "voter": "0x0e002B66D1eC5732d0f88467f196F2d34960eDE0", "created": 1636185590, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "diadao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xf50d4629b3900e4bb96de85aafe3eefc04facbf92842ed70481146d72d21715e", "voter": "0xa7b7d4ebF1F5035F3b289139baDa62f981f2916E", "created": 1636185457, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "diadao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe5312befe2d8e0e6fc7c95d9a62c58fc6a8d8bb5a4f9d97f2b6c8194fef1eb53", "voter": "0x5701068cA0bA0338a5B64e8F59d5ae661e9eCfc0", "created": 1636149652, "choice": 6, "space": {"id": "diadao.eth"}}]}
