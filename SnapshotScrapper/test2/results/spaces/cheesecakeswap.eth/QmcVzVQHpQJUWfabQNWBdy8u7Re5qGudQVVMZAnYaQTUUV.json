We\u2019ve weighed our options here, and decided to offer our community 2 main options regarding how our Polygon branch should be opened;\n\n1- Bridging $CCAKE Between BSC and Polygon\n\nAfter our correspondence with the Polygon team, we\u2019ve established that AnySwap is the official, and most preferred bridge platform between two networks; but after reviewing their contracts and methods, we realized AnySwap does not offer a \u201cMint & Distribute\u201d style of rewarding. That is, there will be no minting on our Polygon Masterchef; so supply required for the rewards in the Polygon chain will be provided from our dev account in BSC.\n\nAs you know, we currently have a 0.75 $CCAKE / block reward in BSC, and our dev account\u2019s share, which will be the reward distributed in the Polygon network, is 10% : 0.075 $CCAKE / block. In the Polygon network, this will amount to 2160 $CCAKE/day. Naturally;\nThere will be no burning in BSC network, as all rewards for the dev account will be transferred into Polygon Masterchef contract for reward supply.\nOur dev account in Polygon Masterchef will not be getting any rewards as well.\n\nAnySwap executes the following method of bridging;;\nFor BSC -> Polygon: Lock $CCAKE in BSC, mint $CCAKE in Polygon,\nFor Polygon -> BSC: Burn $CCAKE in Polygon, release locked $CCAKE in BSC.\n\nTherefore, while BSC -> Polygon will be available, Polygon -> BSC bridge will only be available for users who used BSC -> Polygon beforehand. Here are some clarifications;\nA user cannot bridge from Polygon -> BSC from scratch.\nIf a user has bridged X $CCAKE from BSC -> Polygon, then user can use Polygon -> BSC bridge for maximum X $CCAKE\nTherefore, there will be a direct link between $CCAKE BSC and $CCAKE Polygon, which allows one token and different block rewards on both networks.\n\nFor this option, there is something we like to add; despite being the official bridge platform in Polygon network, AnySwap is not ensuring 100% transaction success for their bridge services as they are still offering their Beta Version currently. However, it is also important to mention that AnySwap has not encountered any transaction malfunction or security breach yet.\n\nNevertheless, as CheesecakeSwap, we have always put security first and operated on a \u201csimple but secure\u201d approach. Although we believe this is a viable option, we\u2019re sorry to say that we will not be accepting any responsibility in case of a transaction error, contract-wise security breach etc. on AnySwap\u2019s part. As always, we recommend to DYOR, and use this bridging service at your own risk, if this option is preferred.\n\n2- Launching a Separate Project in Polygon\n\nIn this option, we will be launching a new, separate project in Polygon. Our contracts ( Token, Masterchef and Timelock) will be identical code and structure-wise. We will be creating a new token, $PCCAKE, for the Polygon network. There will be no link between $CCAKE in BSC, and $PCCAKE in Polygon. After launch, the general state will be as follows;\n\nBlock rewards will be higher compared to $CCAKE,\nInitial Supply will begin from 0,\nNaturally, TVL will be 0 as well, so high APRs,\nThere will be no link between BSC $CCAKE.and Polygon $PCCAKE,\nSince Polygon $PCCAKE is a new launch, it will have higher rewards & APRs,\nBecause of the listed issues above, BSC $CCAKE will have a lower priority in the beginning and Polygon $PCCAKE will be more preferable..\n\nFair launch strategy will be assumed in both options. Launch date / Block number will be announced accordingly, after poll results.", "choices": ["Bridging Between BSC and Polygon", "A Separate Project on Polygon"], "start": 1625331600, "end": 1625590800, "snapshot": "8838500", "state": "closed", "author": "0x42F9bADFB084FA445965CB8006965E2c9dC2b146", "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth", "name": "CheesecakeSwap"}, "votes": 22, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPcpjc3CGiBjJ1KkEdcXF9PZ6zzjApZbJXozZuqDDA7Mk", "voter": "0x6A3B722F8c365F5cBB2759461640CDca50dbD8a3", "created": 1625563774, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZzsjHe95U7PPjARBQusuAYuijAdJgK8KidVws16W1Qg2", "voter": "0xebd36AC1fc22c078161c4E756FcFe63d17FC3a1d", "created": 1625428229, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYiYGD1pcRGVrtoWU7RQSnDCV937M25KQqQwM6CmqwoHN", "voter": "0x5E0957bBf9452fB9BA724fc7bEB1463fcC3967C1", "created": 1625421054, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVJtFNY5dDDEMM8qbEw9EeCfQpQmS9q69JSuzgxdedFeV", "voter": "0x713D4f0C1479C49d99ae4B054692450f34039DC2", "created": 1625410781, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdFNvQuuUrnBfF2wCpcXYZts8Pm2qnbapCkyVioa1PTGE", "voter": "0x151Ce4b087363002085B1DE8D238001b6bE4f397", "created": 1625408158, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmduELXrPGrxH5f2aKVKk9mEm2zEoXiAu7Wun5ZVaqca3G", "voter": "0xCEaADc5C54d1011B99852D314B7E85914b200474", "created": 1625404294, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUcF88FP6c4ZZHHNkrU9dUayQs1NMHQVanBXdFm9z8HFY", "voter": "0xfF5fcec3EE94Bc145F0b5F852a29F3bA88f790c7", "created": 1625403681, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSnwAV4Ubv8BVPn2A5uzR7qM3ASuwQpEy2G6JDtfQrbPf", "voter": "0xB95BF608b7e5175967D32AbA2ed903FD337A6e89", "created": 1625403330, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd4WFtd4kfwEHq9vPuxApcstL2a3gTZJ68518tsjSzZTd", "voter": "0xE0153aEcCc9CF3Dd2a2cE151C6BD61F8f1990cc6", "created": 1625403080, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVZ5EZ8rqnP6NCTFTmuG5gfJNCJiL3Pf3TVFq3PaSCS4N", "voter": "0xdC79c0F4839Da3D2C7e575Da787e97dB9905d78B", "created": 1625392526, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXAAoMohQCipVEU4ndAkhH3JJ5tH438fGbk7SMfnnbwQU", "voter": "0x6B4b531Aa0d19EF5FbAE62c64Ba41647a63AB201", "created": 1625375715, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXvcqrrahF1LpZwgZTxGjEgf18qbX95A9LZCenPDJ3hZW", "voter": "0xc4238FE4644c7dDbDfc938332dEdf9ab1e9f5DdC", "created": 1625346931, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWSwHjRcBYrN3UvTbeqMktqooUiDxpVkx6ueJG7phZzPf", "voter": "0x08636F95c594aE53080eb78462454BbBACDF37ED", "created": 1625346027, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdmukLaXttR1LUeRq45z5N3k8WuYhZVeFm9pZkFGdNbNh", "voter": "0xfAfF36291B7Bf3CCa3e164ffC93d69a45410fb0A", "created": 1625345574, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ6Zzxthv9twDPfHUbbHYBLQCearM1p1ZBQZFThtBk2Sd", "voter": "0x9465700832177eD7d6aCe36ecaF92530FC7d5C72", "created": 1625340934, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcmuUPPJkmJA4bcqMgitrNeCDTviHiwUoeRLSQXPBR9qu", "voter": "0x473a3E0350291C151B0eCce34945ECb4478dE00f", "created": 1625339909, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeBKBXhmwbM42h4m2WvjLKeU6bNa3S8uGSjGEg7zdzhEr", "voter": "0x957bAc5c334E09d6fB8A16D9b611f53751cA4d04", "created": 1625339569, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTCveuTrWta7cXLCFuNEwbxr5qbxvAPCRiN2AnnTbsn3C", "voter": "0x82aAE147a90622dF12c2896e914042513c836308", "created": 1625338461, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbw6m7v4XdFBBijoMtshkDLcJmhtBjwHet3nbp6EXB9bs", "voter": "0x138BFb4163eeEEfC7B55F0915a14632F66B498C1", "created": 1625336604, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeLMJqEXDF7uo4CrqApZNwzneFyqB1jxLPRSc2G9e9xcx", "voter": "0x221Ef110e3F9c4641DdE3930BA8c1b2AA6C9fb03", "created": 1625334324, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmexW9hRhXrUZLvPmpv9tpeg8jT1DCRM8M5zwcDQCT2Zwv", "voter": "0x28057fA4424e8c602136475359A18f8Cb45D5353", "created": 1625333439, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdnNjbaKGGizrpzryXNApCQvPwKg88W4tc5wD8hmFqGXw", "voter": "0x27afd54234Dd5514C3D52AEDe85DC44e5ca649A5", "created": 1625333228, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cheesecakeswap.eth"}}]}
