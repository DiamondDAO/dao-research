Cashing out tp pay rent, pay for a holiday or even placing a deposit on a property will attract the attention of the tax man in most countries. However there is a solution. \nWhat if a crypto project could purchase a property and the token holders own shares in the property through staked funds, gain rental returns through stablecoins, use tokens as rent or timeshare properties around the world!\nThere are countries worldwide where Pool Investors could initiate the purchase of pre-existing real estate and receive high rates of holiday rental return.\nImagine owning a share through a staked Pool in a beachfront villa in your favourite holiday destination. The App could provide token holders choices between various property proposals and token holders (Governance) could vote on which properties to purchase with the pooled funds, then stake a stablecoin to a particular property pool, receive a percentage of rental returns paid as staking rewards, additionally stakers gain capital growth with the property over time. Additionally token holders vote to sell underperforming properties or renovate properties (add a pool, extra room etc). An opportunity for a long term investment to a crypto project that will not dump when BTC price dumps, actually the opposite, as investors look for safe havens I would expect the price to rise, DYNASTY provides a real life use case. \nToken holders may use tokens for time share in property or to purchase a property outright through options to purchase the entire staking pool, or gain long term rentals.\nImagine paying rent with gains from crypto, or purchasing property with your gains for hard assets!", "choices": ["yes", "no", "maybe"], "start": 1620784800, "end": 1622426400, "snapshot": "12313880", "state": "closed", "author": "0x91093B33bEf45A6eA850EfAa68344c764b0BA220", "space": {"id": "liftkitchen.eth", "name": "Lift.Kitchen"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
