Many members have not had sufficient time to review the original, much less the revised document which they are asking us to sign, and I am asking for a hold on any constitutional ratification vote for at least seven days. \n\nI was able to identify at least one loophole in the original draft constitution that would have allowed the fund manager veto authority over \"community votes\", which was very concerning. While there appears to have been some changes made to address this issue, it is ill advised to call for vote on a revised document less than 24 hours later. I still consider us to be in the alpha stage of the Lift.Kitchen experiment, and it seems very premature to approve a binding resolution at this early stage, especially as many investors may not have had time to review this document. \n\nIn fact, since there is essentially no exit option for early investors who have staked liquidity into the protocol for at least 90 days, I think any binding governance votes without an exit option is premature. Still, we must have some signaling method for the DAO that will allow Lift to move forward with funding proposals. \n\nTo this end, I propose a delay of seven days to allow further revisions on the draft document, with a successful vote constituting provisional acceptance of said document until a date of 120 days from the Genesis date. Up until that time, changes to the draft constitution may be made via a majority \"community\" vote, with the founding team forced to abstain from voting.", "choices": ["Yes, delay binding vote", "No, proceed with binding vote", "Abstain"], "start": 1620493200, "end": 1620752400, "snapshot": "12391411", "state": "closed", "author": "0xd82Cac867d8D08E880Cd30C379e79d9e48876b8b", "space": {"id": "liftkitchen.eth", "name": "Lift.Kitchen"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
