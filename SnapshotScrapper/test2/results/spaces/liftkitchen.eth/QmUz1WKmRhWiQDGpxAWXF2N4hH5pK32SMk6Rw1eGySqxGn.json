Businesses can not only advertise/promote their business for a fee, but also provide special deals to users who identify their location as they travel using the APP, a local bakery has bread that must be sold within a certain amount of time so after 9am anyone in area gets an advertisement for 50% discount on bread, a local motel that has vacancies can advertise half price rooms after 5pm to anyone travelling in area, businesses can pay more to promote their business in real time to customers who are in the area as opposed to blanket marketing.\nSo basically copy a successful model that already exists but better!\nThe App will provide incentives for users of the App, users can contribute by identifying accidents, traffic jams and police radars etc. (get paid in tokens once the accident/radar is verified by 50 or more users - in built systems to prevent gaming), they can choose to keep the user location secret for privacy and earn no incentives or alternatively drive to earn - opt to sell their location to local businesses for advertisement. \nI suggest a 2 token structure, a Governance token (non-inflationary) that can be staked for rewards generated from advertisement revenue, and a token that gets sent to users for participating (inflationary token).\nGovernance token holders can eventually receive additional benefits like fuel discounts, vehicle servicing discounts, tyre purchase discounts etc. from our partners who are advertising with our APP.
