But with this growth comes a refocusing of our purpose.\n\nOur project is based on the Ethereum network and we have no plans to move away from this blockchain platform. However, we want to assure you that we are aware of the limitations of this foundation, such as the high gas fees. At the same time we, are certain that these issues will be resolved soon with the release of ETH 2.\n\nOur token, the SUNI TOKEN, has a total supply of 1,000,000,000 Sunis. At this time, 10,000,000 Sunis (or 1% of the total supply), has been released for direct purchase in Uniswap.\n\nThose who have chosen to invest in this initial 1% are considered the \u201cmain users\u201d and will be receiving the corresponding airdrop. However, the beneficiaries of this airdrop program will be determined by community vote. Currently, our main pool of SUNI/ETH is still being completed. Given the circumstances, we are at a point where we must discuss possibilities with the community to find the most practical and professional way to increase liquidity in the UNISWAP pool.\n\nWe are trying to determine how to best move forward while balancing the growth of the project with all of the unique financial aspects.\n\nAs the token price increases almost daily, adding liquidity is one of our top priorities. We are beginning to catch the interest of investors who want to help improve the health of our planet by supporting Suni, and we want to ensure their ability to purchase as demand rises.\n\nHere are two possible options for moving forward.\n\n## A. Monthly liquidity proposal\n\n- The first option is to slowly add liquidity every month. We believe that this is the most beneficial option as it continues to increase the price of the currency itself, and does not negatively impact the investors or market cap. It is important to stress the fact that this option will NOT affect the price of Suni. We believe this is the safest option for investors.\n\n- As with any project involving blockchain technology, financing is crucial. It needs to be carefully considered in order to build a sustainable and powerful project.\n\n- Through this path, our main source of income will be obtained through NFT projects distributed through blockchain networks.\n\n- We have several exciting plans for how this can help further our mission of protecting the environment.\n\n- Slowly but surely, by adding monthly liquidity in amounts between 1,000,000 - 50,000,000 Sunis, we will be able to access the necessary resources without disturbing the currency in the process.\n\n- We believe this is the best option for growing liquidity without lowering the price per token.\n\n\n## B. 50% liquidity increase\n- We have another option available to us which would allow us rapid access to 50% of the liquidity pool, however it potentially comes with more complications.\n\n- With any currency based on blockchain technology, the market value reflects the initial investment into the token as well as any additional investments. If there is a strong financial base, a token has a stronger position in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n- We commit to ensuring there is constant liquidity, whether that be through a steady increase over time or through one decisive action.\n\n- When we look at our current pool of SUNI / ETH, a substantial increase to the liquidity, like the proposed 49%, will be difficult to fund as Suni doesn\u2019t currently have that level of investment just yet.\n\n- A potential solution is to create a new pool of liquidity by adding SUNI / UNI (or any other cryptocurrency selected by the community). While this has many benefits, the major drawback is how it lowers the price and the value of the currency\u2019s initial financial impact.\n\n- These two options have been made with consideration to how other DeFi projects have been managed in the past. We will support whichever decision the community deems most appropriate.\n\n\n", "choices": ["Monthly liquidity proposal", "50% liquidity increase"], "start": 1616922000, "end": 1617526800,
