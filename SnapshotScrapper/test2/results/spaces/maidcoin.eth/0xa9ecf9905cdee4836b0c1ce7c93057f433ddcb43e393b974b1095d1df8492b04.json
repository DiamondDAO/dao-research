Rank your favorite ones from 1 to 8.\n\n# Proposals\n## MAID-INU OHM\nThe idea is to tap into the crazy market demand for MEME-OHM projects by re-branding MAID into MAID-INU with the staking and bonding mechanics of OHM and NFT integration. MAID-INU OHM has the potential to stand out from the rest with its beautiful yet currently underappreciated Chowbie NFTs, along with the clean history and established reputation of MAIDCOIN and LEVX DAO. - by *Phantas*\nhttps://web3md.io/#/post/0x8df68380b39699ba5e490d153acd63e2c87b47ef69cb33d4733aaf4e8ef3fcc1\n\n## Control Supply and Increase Demand\nMy proposal will be time-locked staking $MAID coin to payout something consumable coin. Instead of paying $MAID coin for staking reward, pay something consumable coin (for example, a coin that can be used to buy NFT random box). This way, there will be fewer coins to be traded at the market, and the desire to obtain NFT will lead to more coins being staked and time-locked. We still need to find out the optimal amount of consumables coins for time-locked $MAID. I am thinking about something similar coin relationship for AXS and SLP coin model. Marketing will be required to make this acceptable and known to people. - by *SoSoWiz*\nhttps://web3md.io/#/post/0x7e9b39edf0733f1b127c5f41766368decf8e9b68b659be8fe5119a5ab7b3d4a8\n\n## Maid Proposal by Scrooge\nThe tokenomics of Maid is complex. My proposal is to create a more clear onboarding experience for new users. - by *Scrooge*\nhttps://web3md.io/#/post/0x1da2b3df791f9eb39186820e2682f030617c95636b787a98bf958512850effb6\n\n## Make $MAID great again\nLet\u2019s take some actions to rescue our lovely MAID!!!\nTypically there\u2019re several effective measures to make price surge. - by *flamingo*\nhttps://web3md.io/#/post/0x04cde0b952ff3d8aae945bcad7a70743d18895e25e86ed2b0fc7f4d40d1093c9\n\n## Maidverse Tokenomics Revamp\nCurrent tokenomics in terms of both emissions, burning, and allocation are \u201cfixed\u201d and does not reflect the state of the MAID ecosystem. However, the issue is that the emissions level was unbalanced if based on a fixed schedule without considering demand. As a result, initial high APYs have invited the usual farm and dumpers that have crashed the price and leaving the mcap stagnant. In trying to stop sell pressure, a much stricter emissions halving schedule was implemented which will highly limit MAID supply very quickly and limit the ability of users to play games. The supply shock will also heavily influence the relative cost to play games. - by *aisha*\nhttps://web3md.io/#/post/0xd614eb20a63f5e47e12c4ea0a8082c971c471f4fb653682cc954bb359f8dd088\n\n## Outlining Maidverse Game Mechanics, and Possible Team Expansion\nIf we want to salvage the MAID token, the best value proposition we have is the game.  Right now the economic system is incomplete.  Even with hype, if the economics are broken the system will collapse.  There\u2019s a mechanism for passive income, but there is nothing to win and no reason to hold.  Which means all passive income will just be a drain with no relief.  Correcting this would require a paradigm where juicy prizes make competition attractive, being competitive requires MAID, and a large body of players are attracted to work toward a specific objective and receive compensation for their work. - by *Lululute*\nhttps://web3md.io/#/post/0x2389e987394eff54a4535c0e1161c4e4a0cc2e262ca4b77bca587cf88b3eead4\n\n## Create a partnership pool\nNumerous NFT projects did not issue tokens, but the trend these days is NFT linked with Tokenomics.\nThe issuance of ERC20 tokens is not easy, but the process of registering it on the DEX and registering the chart or Coin Market Cap or something is quite banal and takes a long time.\nIt is hard to find a team that designed a proper tokenomics there. - by *Dr. Ada*\nhttps://web3md.io/#/post/0x6fcfca09fab9ac241a5e165e2073e23f9acc5205e5747d277003d6e3b866f887\n\n## Adoption of Olympus Pro Bonds Program\nEnter Olympus Pro\u2019s Bond Program on a trial-basis to strengthen MaidCoin\u2019s liquidity pool and reduce supply-driven sell-pressure. This would be run in parallel to the already available MAID-ETH LP \u201cMaid Corporation\u201d farm, with this farm eventually being phased out and emissions removed (potential to re-allocated emissions to nurse LP staking farms instead). - by *0x...hiatus*\nhttps://web3md.io/#/post/0xb164128d4785916ea0897dbc6a5aa7f9334d9de3a8595433f60464c95b2f94cd\n", "choices": ["MAID-INU OHM", "Control
