Thus, the team decided that this is not good for holders so we need to take some measurement to protect users from exposure to further dumps.\nWe believe the best way to prevent inflation is to reduce the emission earlier than planned. Our original plan was to reduce the emission from 1 $MAID/block to 0.5 $MAID/block (originally planned) in 525600 but we propose it to be changed to 86400 blocks, which is approximately 15 days.\n\n## Specification\nIf this proposal is passed, [TheMaster contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCD9E5C7969A4C0B4FA8726B243143381f4984337#readContract)'s `rewardCalculator`(currently it's address(0)) will be set to a new `RewardCalculator` that changes the emission decreasing period from 525600 blocks to 86400 blocks called by our [Gnosis Safe multisig](0x30080df30F21a710B31F5fC7FA149a5c452eABFa). In result, the first decreasement will happend at block 13402400(estimated to be  Tue Oct 12 2021 03:24:39 UTC), which means from that block only 0.5 $MAID will be minted every block).\n\nWe know that some users, especially those who were already having Nurse NFTs will not like this proposal because their profit will not be the same as before but this is for the entire ecosystem. With this update, we can expect the sell pressure to be weakened and so users will rather choose to stake & keep more $MAIDs for future rewards.\n\n[New Emission Estimation Table](https://imgur.com/R2myHth)\n\n*If you want to discuss about modification, feel free to do it in out #governance channel*\n", "choices": ["Yay", "Some modification required", "Nay"], "start": 1633442400, "end": 1633701600, "snapshot": "13359472", "state": "closed", "author": "0x77466365e1be100f8E1Ac907AfE4151Ea21c528E", "space": {"id": "maidcoin.eth", "name": "MaidCoin"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmeaBv5unsfyujQ83UqpYRduqFmKjSP18c7ZxBqpGfYrGk", "voter": "0x5143B2F5e573Be79aA5D96Ae1367bFC6F095C4d9", "created": 1633532119, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "maidcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVYZjY9LTxmF36yUY99p6hkqnVRRQLPXyVFHQCp4pCHb6", "voter": "0x178442Bb4d0D479B63136B27Ef92495381244A70", "created": 1633471015, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "maidcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRCVAMS8DxKmMxgZTPoP9nhthHdCiD7LC8e1eFqap72MS", "voter": "0x008c79Eba51De3D1Ca362Ba16B08E44283Fb5F1B", "created": 1633460105, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "maidcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUPERMvSjYNQpWgvCZbLPjWdHsiDa6PK3M1hDTrf6wR4x", "voter": "0xE56a354b83a748A2aaa6b8fDAA293d9f891BD388", "created": 1633451087, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "maidcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbro7c4zDvUAx3DLf8dpwJD4UxgywSFQJWTXqWW3ExJHr", "voter": "0x55AEA4cd456478d56F598E06A0dB228192D5eb84", "created": 1633449901, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "maidcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNzxrxaC93YXyxXALyakM2smFaT8kRnxuqghwpYjp4DxU", "voter": "0x9b37FcC74BB47Acb9723D1D9C09A3414a1310794", "created": 1633447782, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "maidcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPyrz9ykC74Pwcb8M61CbFGChhCW3P1NpkTHvfiiGHBh7", "voter": "0xc853215B9B9F2D2Cd0741E585E987b5fb80C212E", "created": 1633444949, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "maidcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV6c5UmsnEeXcFrqp6HcRVqtYQaQHwce7SC1sZr7KeSVh", "voter": "0x6eb13Bf70eDaADE22B0C5a7F0De7138Ce96d53DB", "created": 1633444633, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "maidcoin.eth"}}]}
