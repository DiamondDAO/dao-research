In order to expand applications of NEST token, we are very happy to work with dForce to make NEST available anytime, anywhere by listing NEST Token (NEST Protocol oracle native token) on dForce.\n\nAbout NEST Protocol\n\nNEST Protocol is a decentralized pricing oracle network that provides an oracle service platform for various on-chain native assets as well as on-chain price and volatility data for DeFi protocols. It is dedicated to building a decentralized on-chain price database and infrastructure for on-chain native assets in the blockchain world, offering more possibilities for decentralized finance.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/NEST-Protocol 12\n\nNEST Token contract address: 0x04abeda201850ac0124161f037efd70c74ddc74c\n\nSecurity Audit: https://github.com/NEST-Protocol/NEST-Oracle-V3.6/blob/main/docs/PeckShield-Audit-Report-NestV3.6.pdf\n\nNEST Protocol derived DeFi ecosystem:\n\nIt has been more than two years since NEST Protocol was launched in 2018. From lending to oracles to non-cooperative game systems, it has updated and iterated three major and minor versions and has gradually evolved into an ecosystem based on price oracles. Various DeFi products can be derived from the NEST Protocol price information flow. Incubated projects include the automatic market maker protocol CoFiX and the parallel asset protocol Parasset.\n\n1. NEST Token has participated in pledging and minting p-asset in Parasset, and p-assets will be converted into native assets. For example, pledge NEST to mint pUSDT, then convert pUSDT to USDT to increase cash flow for leveraged transactions, or deposit in Prarasst insurance pool to earn a stable fee, and obtain Parasset token reward for protocol interaction. Currently, Parasset has locked up approximately 160 million NEST Tokens, which is about US$3.4M, and minted approximately US$1.3M in parallel assets.\n\n2. After the launch of CoFiX 2.0, NEST Token has participated in CoFiX 2.0's market making from the NEST/ETH pool to obtain CoFi token rewards. Professional hedgers could also receive CoFi token rewards for hedging. CoFi has been circulating in Matcha and Gate.\n\n3. Projects under development within the ecosystem also include derivative protocol Fort and an asset management protocol.\n\nNEST Token repurchase:\n\n1. All projects in the ecosystem need to call the NEST oracle when price data is used, and all the calling fees (ETH) go to NEST DAO for NEST Token repurchase.\n\n2. NEST oracle quotation fees (ETH) will all go to NEST DAO, and NEST Token will be repurchased.\n\n3. 20% of other QP Token quotation fees (ETH) goes to NEST DAO, NEST Token is repurchased. 80% will go to their respective DAO to buy back the corresponding QP Token. Newly opened oracle pays NEST token to NEST DAO.\n\nNEST Token Voting:\n\n1 NEST Token = 1 vote\n\nAll NEST Token holders are entitled to the governance of the NEST Protocol. Any changes to the NEST Protocol and the use of NEST DAO funds will be governed by on-chain votes.\n\nNEST Token acquisition:\n\nQuotation mining script: https://github.com/NEST-Protocol/NEST-Oracle-V3.6-minner 10\nHoubi Exchange Purchase\n\nNEST and dForce Partnership\n\nMore than 2.5 billion NEST Tokens have been produced, and the ecological prototype has been established. The partnership with dForce will continue to increase dForce's native asset collateral TVL, bringing funds and liquidity to dForce. Soon, other QP Token native quotation assets and native DeFi protocol assets in the NEST ecosystem will have opportunities to participate in dForce lending, and both parties will reach a win-win cooperation.\n\nCurrent circulation of NEST Token: https://cryptonative.top/topics/552\n\nWe look forward to cooperating with dForce! We hope that dForce and the NEST communities agree on this proposal.", "choices": ["\u540c\u610f", "\u4e0d\u540c\u610f"], "start": 1629860400, "end": 1630141200, "snapshot": "13086596", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7ccaD45FCbbaeCd43f960c5af4E82ed2a0021d7C", "space": {"id": "dforce", "name": "dForce"}, "votes": 18, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmavJUZy4K4JKhjmFBpeMR4gHAbuXRFfW1Q1mvmNUspekF", "voter": "0x53b998be85641603BF740d579c1844d6894B3c8f", "created": 1630100842, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "Qmdg411cDMf7A5B5EUEaeu6CPqnCpGZD6tZGYBcvD8KxHT", "voter": "0xd00b8B0addf349502487153e1db97b4d9DB6343b", "created": 1630100570, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "Qma1TFja2bMgsqh4TUgXSMdvT5aN1EYDdxeESqpEkb2eJd", "voter": "0x56B6b94111277ecDD6f72047BE0600503776d309", "created": 1629978002, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmadGFpR23f4khUnWo8bZCWugsbieMV777P6GtD67wKSYg", "voter": "0x83A771769D1A344deED9Ea24aB58071e9Db2D90A", "created": 1629960258, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmQvrtGBAtzkGEpn8CWHNn45WJWZmFvRoG55k3wJX73n8B", "voter": "0x0559BC9D1d5F92D6908185650F16BA72d1dee0b4", "created": 1629958105, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmXfVKHo6BqUuLt7QeskrJ9qNNxYKrpkV8QmdGAEUwy1ug", "voter": "0xaA45bf7cc1765E79BD0BC51F4F452309AB0ADCc4", "created": 1629957954, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmbrEShsGrVNhEJzW4ZMFLw4G8dQ523uD2duUBNZUcxz51", "voter": "0xC379223899f6475D09F4f9676B0Ca7f990D5D739", "created": 1629957810, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmauoMTSwEXgXSycPhaFMLcfpjorJ5rCwQzSNG1fPLjsCw", "voter": "0x54aC9E57fE5d2f21f8DF4e94e60186cB9C7F4746", "created": 1629957600, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmaVuo7znc3MZUzevCFAe6yoe1XimoUhaNkgyKTqq6j3op", "voter": "0xF67b7969c0e85fDD47A48c9514Be53FF10f4dBf1", "created": 1629957445, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmNcAWNh8Y93KYqodcZgXdCnAk5DsH1MMTr8M9iUgprjw2", "voter": "0x09849240026E0131e386f8aA9720E3733AAf5574", "created": 1629957422, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmTwWU4LejY7CDBWQpS6qRFZKuiwfGrY6pht7tv1yjQQM7", "voter": "0x6e1C24586d0DFEB608E0442a8A1Ce772afEC03a6", "created": 1629957358, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmWJhq7bF9UwoTttjnGSYWwTRZEPtSjD5u2TtkLhV3iuhs", "voter": "0xf12Ea7a310247F46437D16a1D8Ae88E359Fb3D09", "created": 1629957244, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmTidjkQg9um6W3UdT4tLM92V74a5nTtMJvLLsB3Dz8cis", "voter": "0x0a759F4666e1B691Bd1BE20aa20e7C97dB503030", "created": 1629907083, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmbNLneeauxZxMHPQ8dSfExLL9jQcDRiEGVQd3LaZrp2kR", "voter": "0x330B0CCAB0f07047e843B2380BC54575Ec99Bcf7", "created": 1629906460, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmX6x9iWYAzNTME8PRnCZJ4An4iz8P778raZ9RZv9q2615", "voter": "0x6465c4f28E9BFCb9f1Cf983A4f2062A7574f327F", "created": 1629906307, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmThSM7hbxrB6EHGMBx176Vwaj1SAQtKpkv6d6BK9ig2ua", "voter": "0x67AD1b339bedc5Ba4C2AE4FcD2A76DDF859eEB25", "created": 1629906021, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmUHacht5BNT2Txt3Av1PeKGrDUJJ1ZDFrjvLN3Es5AV7Z", "voter": "0x2b27dbE5Ea25D1000d33AECf41d176D5b61593D4", "created": 1629905642, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmXG4zWenvjbG4yAcQELELWRppff8J6QSwK2kUPFPgiZ48", "voter": "0x7ccaD45FCbbaeCd43f960c5af4E82ed2a0021d7C", "created": 1629863400, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}]}
