Currently, dForce Yield Markets predominantly supports stablecoins. \nOnce ETH and BTC are added to Yield Markets, users will be able to deposit ETH and WBTC into dForce\u2019s Yield Markets. The yield market contract will manage and deploy the deposited assets to strategies on supported lending protocols to generate yields. \nAs dForce Lending nears launch, we also propose Yield Markets to add strategies supporting dForce Lending.\n\n\nBackground:\n\ndForce\u2019s Yield Markets is a yield aggregator designed to farm risk-adjusted yields across DeFi protocols with attractive returns. Instant deposit & withdrawal is supported. Tokens supplied into Yield Markets will be re-lended to supported lending protocols, which currently are Compound and Aave.\ndForce\u2019s Yield Markets now support USDx, USDT, USDC, and DAI. When users deposit supported tokens, they will receive corresponding dToken on a pro rata basis (i.e. depositing USDT to receive dUSDT). Each dToken represents a pro rata claim of the underlying token plus yields generated. Users can also participate in dForce (DF) liquidity mining by staking dTokens.\n\n\nProposal:\n\nWe would like to present the following proposals: \n1)\tProposal to add ETH and WBTC to the list of assets supported on Yield Markets, so users can easily deposit their ETH and WBTC and earn yields generated from underlying strategies. \n2)\tYield Markets to add new handler and strategy support for dForce\u2019s Lending protocol for all its supported assets.\n\n\nEvaluation and Analysis:\n\ndForce\u2019s Yield Markets currently already supports standard ERC20 tokens, so enabling support for WBTC won\u2019t require additional engineering and audit efforts. However, for ETH, which is different to a standard ERC20 token, we would need moderate development efforts and engagement with a 3rd party audit before implementation. \n\nNew Strategies and Handler support: \n\nCurrent dForce Yield Markets support lending protocols Compound and Aave. As we near the launch of dForce Lending, we would like to extend dForce Yield Markets strategies and handler support to include dForce Lending protocol. \n\nSecurity: \n\ndForce Lending already completed its security audit and formal verification by CertiK and Certora. We will also be adding two more audits from world class audit firms over the next weeks. \n\nNext Steps:\n\nOnce enough votes are collected to move forward, the following will happen:\nDevelopment of ETH Vault and 3rd party audit for the ETH support proxy. This requires modest efforts. \nYield Markets to add new strategies and handler support for the upcoming dForce Lending covering all its supported assets. No additional engineering efforts would be required (except ETH support).\n\n", "choices": ["For", "Aganist"], "start": 1613811600, "end": 1614070800, "snapshot": "11892793", "state": "closed", "author": "0x83A771769D1A344deED9Ea24aB58071e9Db2D90A", "space": {"id": "dforce", "name": "dForce"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNekLCCb3SXoQCq523yoyWLgKxPvZtZcJ1v1BRwcyBtSM", "voter": "0x09849240026E0131e386f8aA9720E3733AAf5574", "created": 1614001306, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmZKLcqjqJsfvqnYw2BjJG6haYzSV1sdUtyYAeQgsKKngf", "voter": "0xF67b7969c0e85fDD47A48c9514Be53FF10f4dBf1", "created": 1614001257, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmYUibX4rMeGqp7CDRpvJNKCZ6YAj3Jp5mEQLcauQrQf5q", "voter": "0xA29DbaA84a9949A0A38a2Ba07E0b75e6603934DB", "created": 1613986830, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmXRGtn1M5w3GzRck1ChmkyqoB69k8drDsdUz84twoBnJ9", "voter": "0xe53e118308961b25859C26dEbF70332A88Ba5C86", "created": 1613888069, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmVRhE84w2yd6kv1voGkwQs53FuB3DteyPhYVXi4EEKir8", "voter": "0x90522372FC37eb1B835Db2C191711417F468F253", "created": 1613888046, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmX9ZwygUEYthfboMJK9DtGuf9K2uCyvD4Efu6NGuCJVMZ", "voter": "0x346d76F7924aA05aFf865834379A1EDb26d00347", "created": 1613888001, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmcfFxwigirp8usMUkbDACNw9VCyTbEU8yVPkssbVTLkQP", "voter": "0x41FbB7EBA01804b60817236dB585d7A842fECab8", "created": 1613835099, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmbqUvSPkF8BBtczr7D38KM2xaV1sSGQ4a2uN6cfsJQR3F", "voter": "0x62Da334dbA84a7d0be98F940cF2C45cA2F691aB9", "created": 1613821057, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmcihPEdFRhjP49cCPMoxV11SxqUBQt98LQfmvfofDuomc", "voter": "0xeA199722372dea9DF458dbb56be7721af117a9Bc", "created": 1613815804, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmQhHU39aUFRwzp3S7vV7vaPoa4PKegx3XffivZZLDjx7w", "voter": "0xd2a24131A564f00ebdA75b34fC6fd5D91Bc32693", "created": 1613815633, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmabA3JMojZPTwDidkgUSa2FFcDt2WRtmnwyUcy2XkJBqy", "voter": "0x5346AFB94c08AC53dc8a18aa318Cf0383826eD68", "created": 1613815621, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmXgi5b814oydukdVAmM1nFqd97Y99hLjuGBnfs2QLCh8E", "voter": "0x471862fc58e7cF2346C2A2929899b0184d40e279", "created": 1613815407, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmY5rZodDhYRX2124mPLCKH5xFrYMsmBYhibd3Vc9XYZJR", "voter": "0xC2A2ba71564C981f6264E6dc1B5E9Eef0A5f0bE3", "created": 1613814496, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmfBLE576rH6meo3vMAmCYTLwbLAF7T9ZGNvSWK2bSyYzS", "voter": "0x220c45232C9bFd7AF022A187d6e96d9EB10e7F59", "created": 1613814410, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmeN1DwgqLLFGST2rJpwLatrLuwLah31mX49atNhQ756mc", "voter": "0x63BcAA7A67A8f90382d4334f63FAb135CEF5AEd3", "created": 1613812699, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmS4293Psx9nf5xStKwcsAWoMnLBy4PyDo9tayKiPdUwCB", "voter": "0xC379223899f6475D09F4f9676B0Ca7f990D5D739", "created": 1613812633, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}]}
