Following [Yield Markets](https://markets.dforce.network/), [dForce Trade](https://trade.dforce.network/), [USDx](https://usdx.dforce.network/), and [GOLDx](https://goldx.dforce.network/), we are seeking support from dForce community to deploy [dForce Lending](https://app.dforce.network/#/lending) on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and its first batch of asset listing.\n\nWe performed risk assessments in accordance with ***dForce Risk Management Policies for Non-Ethereum Assets*** for a number of cryptoassets favored by dForce community, and hereby propose to list BTCB, ETH, BNB, ADA, DOT, ATOM, FIL, UNI, DF, GOLDX, BUSD, USDC, USDT, and DAI as the first batch of assets to be supported by dForce Lending on BSC.\n\n\n**Background**\n\nIn light of different design choice and trade-off made by Binance Smart Chain, including most of the assets issued are at Binance\u2019s custody, our protocol deployed on BSC are independent of protocols run on Ethereum and we need to adopt a different Risks Policy catering to different non-Ethereum chain deployment.\n\nClick [here](https://forum.dforce.network/t/onboarding-new-assets-to-non-ethereum-blockchains/306) to read ***dForce Risk Management Policies for Non-Ethereum Assets***.\n\n\n**Proposal**\n\nWe propose to expand dForce Lending to Binance Smart Chain as an alternative solution to tackle Ethereum scalability issues. After an initial risk assessment, we also propose to list ***BTCB, ETH, BNB, ADA, DOT, ATOM, FIL, UNI, DF, GOLDX, BUSD, USDC, USDT,*** and ***DAI*** as the first batch of assets to be supported.\n\nClick [here](https://forum.dforce.network/t/introduction-and-risk-parameters-of-proposed-assets-to-be-supported-by-dforce-lending-on-binance-smart-chain-bsc/307) to see introduction of proposed assets with risk parameters.\n\nJoin our discussion and voice your opinion through our [Forum](https://forum.dforce.network/c/governance/46).", "choices": ["For", "Aganist"], "start": 1615536000, "end": 1615795200, "snapshot": "12022014", "state": "closed", "author": "0x83A771769D1A344deED9Ea24aB58071e9Db2D90A", "space": {"id": "dforce", "name": "dForce"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmep1yVRBiy6dfRZJNxJx8RDuBKqk5NsfMQ6zgBZCVPEk4", "voter": "0xC2A2ba71564C981f6264E6dc1B5E9Eef0A5f0bE3", "created": 1615700322, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmfSmJ3LdqtvAjVt5sEboPG15Pwu39Nd1Lb3F3PrU3zS6N", "voter": "0xdFe89CAF65862c5B46FA22e8fA2296e05BfCBF94", "created": 1615613653, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmYjd7NBUejQKBLYGzdLA6RUATdpXkmY98sYTkQnjMLAhx", "voter": "0xF67b7969c0e85fDD47A48c9514Be53FF10f4dBf1", "created": 1615613586, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmaGcW2seK6pxEDw41fTXtqio466R4VhmeTbUyunQHaHMC", "voter": "0xA29DbaA84a9949A0A38a2Ba07E0b75e6603934DB", "created": 1615597163, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmU7HTkYcHaFxDV9Qeh9AzdhhkBRvwjPEkfJRwdmzRo1BR", "voter": "0x9843699Cf241e33a53870Cd485A7A757E81aF0f0", "created": 1615572007, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmWY84634zBPTaEPD6CGm2jTHQQEPaAmVYJSHbtTZL7GCv", "voter": "0x36edB08a0C566E5f3054e91B32520a0A2e5ad699", "created": 1615570862, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmcYCqHuNCnHHLFEvFWFeFyHFZGAEBdaMvsrZmhWz5uSiS", "voter": "0xB1720D3650b73C5BF451E87F3A017532497ab2A8", "created": 1615570666, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "Qmd4X7NivZmpkXXz6iSrXzxeSCLgixdZrSVEoGofW977xP", "voter": "0x69389108FAd2E345eBF0C1Aba962071711fb6909", "created": 1615568272, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmYU5v4ozszwBWAHZoTKFgVW1rkLY8fijpMenk95nZZciy", "voter": "0x0DCfe4a0eb5D952b738Eb34d1bf4eF279243C8a7", "created": 1615567507, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmbThhoBPDrzYjCSBKAVeX2tcY1Sm9xrJDo655dS2tHxHC", "voter": "0xa2bcF31F22D585ac9DBb82821018DF853C0Eb679", "created": 1615567366, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmP22iEYVrihQ3TPMLcraT2eMwNLjLypYWs876QiWPcKMC", "voter": "0xC379223899f6475D09F4f9676B0Ca7f990D5D739", "created": 1615559298, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmZVVKZER4mqhX2FDFx5XCvD8vrqQXbKZRDjf34PWBDNSf", "voter": "0xD80c657be94976981CD1F3b329C19da63AcaD34E", "created": 1615558631, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}]}
