Support or objection to this proposal shall apply to dForce lending protocols on Ethereum, BSC, as well as the soon-to-be-launched Arbitrum (upon mainnet launch).\n\nBackground:\n\nWith 6 months of smooth operation and total supplied assets of more than $120m, dForce is now the third largest lending protocol on BSC. Our community expressed a strong interest in extending collateral support to more assets on dForce Lending, which have been compiled for risk assessments in accordance with dForce Risk Framework by the dForce team, including a number of large cap DeFi protocols and infrastructure protocols, as well as a couple more stablecoins, and three pairs of dForce\u2019s LP tokens (for liquidity parked on Pancake).\n\nAdditionally, there are more assets sitting in our pipeline for risk analysis and evaluation, including [Nest](https://forum.dforce.network/t/topic/406/7)  and [Bella](https://forum.dforce.network/t/proposal-list-bel-as-a-collateral-asset-on-dforce-lending/549/2).\n\nProposal:\n\nClick [here](https://forum.dforce.network/t/proposal-for-new-collateral-onboarding/554/1) to view new collateral assets requested by dForce community with proposed parameters and asset analysis, which will be implemented subject to governance approval.", "choices": ["Approve", "Decline"], "start": 1629972000, "end": 1630231200, "snapshot": "13100107", "state": "closed", "author": "0x83A771769D1A344deED9Ea24aB58071e9Db2D90A", "space": {"id": "dforce", "name": "dForce"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmesV3eajWipaSRSorkVwxA2d2bts3H8nEgUCgJCaMXTsm", "voter": "0xaA45bf7cc1765E79BD0BC51F4F452309AB0ADCc4", "created": 1630206190, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmWMe4hvGq2fGnerYSVxL3vQmWGTRHxmV9Q8NJ68SHqxzU", "voter": "0xB62d6F0238Ce2e5749b3E8fC283476Dd606cE28c", "created": 1630206069, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmUKtv9AomXV5NtrXzyLZ1WHRoF2yMkZezAqjFP71WsrBn", "voter": "0x53b998be85641603BF740d579c1844d6894B3c8f", "created": 1630100765, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmUdmGR9ucpPAZfakVcckfmnB42DXz8FXXSkxFFTJQP1Eg", "voter": "0x0a759F4666e1B691Bd1BE20aa20e7C97dB503030", "created": 1630100686, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmWAMysbesCSHveA4zGroUYbB9pdV5FV1UpTWVefBTBxVH", "voter": "0xd00b8B0addf349502487153e1db97b4d9DB6343b", "created": 1630100549, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmUpxiwykXCfi4mFQ9L4UVVKgzy3U6LLEZVVM3iM5rVjM2", "voter": "0x83A771769D1A344deED9Ea24aB58071e9Db2D90A", "created": 1630058806, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmaML8YXho65pP2jRaHJSeKawALbGHnCNJTXB6eY3vSK8M", "voter": "0x56B6b94111277ecDD6f72047BE0600503776d309", "created": 1629978026, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmXu7rSCEtp1Dc3c9SFFBYU4pCBcuVYd56A1V9Rj89AQdL", "voter": "0x0559BC9D1d5F92D6908185650F16BA72d1dee0b4", "created": 1629977896, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}, {"id": "QmPwhPbwmgRRNBuEo4tU4GmoAp7wdiNcj7nXAaxqb768zD", "voter": "0xC379223899f6475D09F4f9676B0Ca7f990D5D739", "created": 1629977317, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dforce"}}]}
