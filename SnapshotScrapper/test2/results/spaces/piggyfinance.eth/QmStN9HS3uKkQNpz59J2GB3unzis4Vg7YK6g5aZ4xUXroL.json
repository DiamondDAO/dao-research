The RFC asked the community which pairs they wanted incentivised, the amount of $PIGGY rewards and timeframe for the round, as well as the suggested format.\n\nAfter considering a few submissions, we now want to submit for vote our first **Piggy Improvement Proposal (PIP)**.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe following are proposed as terms for Piggy's Liquidity Mining, Round Two: \n- duration: 30 days\n- total $PIGGY to spend: \n- pools to incentivise: \n  - `BNB`:`PIGGY`\n    - exchange: PancakeSwap\n    - $PIGGY per day: 7,500\n    - other parameters: default 50-50 weighting \n  - `PUSD`:`BUSD`\n    - exchange: DODO\n    - $PIGGY per day: 2,500\n    - other parameters: \n      - default 50-50 weighting, pegged exchange rate 1, swap fee 0.2%, slippage coefficient 0.0005\n- current bal. of $PIGGY for Liquidity Mining: 2,430,000 $PIGGY\n- remaining bal. of $PIGGY for Liquidity Mining if proposal passes: 2,130,000 $PIGGY\n- format: fluid LP staking, rewards accumulate every BSC block\n- whitelisting: no\n\n## Rationale\n\nThese are the same pairs and exchanges used in our first round of Liquidity Mining. Both DEXs worked very well, and a partnership with DODO has flourished since. The twist is  that Piggy has shown its staying power, particularly the strength of $PUSD, which gives LPs more confidence on that pool such that rewards can be reduced corresponding with the risk.\n\nWe want to encourage more liquidity for $PIGGY, thus we will give 4x the rewards as last round, and for >4x the length of time. Making this a pair with $BNB makes it simple for any BSC user to become an LP, which will benefit participation in $PIGGY and the wider ecosystem. PancakeSwap has the higher liquidity for $BNB and the highest swap volume.\n\nThe amount of incentives at the current $PIGGY price should provide for a triple-digit APY on the $PIGGY pair and a high double-digit APY on the $PUSD pair. These are predictions subject to the price of $PIGGY and the size of the pool. However, the duration of 30 days should allow for a more sustained adoption push in the ecosystem.\n\nThe pool at DODO has been chosen again, just like the first time around, for its low slippage and features to provide enhance liquidity depth. The pair `PUSD`:`BUSD` gives user the opportunity to access all the stablecoin ecosystem in BSC and beyond. With DODO doubling as a DEX aggregator, it is also quite affordable to go from $PUSD to other major BSC tokens like $BNB, $CAKE, $BAKE, $DODO, etc. This allows users to maximise the utility of their Piggy loans.\n\nFinally, the duration of 30 days and the simple farming format with no whitelisting means that yield enhancers and aggregators like Beefy, Autofarm, and Pancake Bunny can partake in our Liquidity Mining which will give offer users a choice of automated compounding as well as the possibility of boosted rewards.\n", "choices": ["Proceed", "Do nothing"], "start": 1626076800, "end": 1626249600, "snapshot": "9086639", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5c4D8CEE7dE74E31cE69E76276d862180545c307", "space": {"id": "piggyfinance.eth", "name": "PiggyFinance"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmU33LTMCDSjU2ykktLtR7S4eh7ZGM4eToRVjzPcp7qqHW", "voter": "0x0cD902EA42B42B06Ff44C05Fd8C3b4417Fdf8426", "created": 1626162408, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "piggyfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmags8vqcoZtaHBCs3vTmhmbZeHMJY7seXMSfe64euYDmL", "voter": "0xa1Db41C9b5786d380A38f9921fD055222389e45b", "created": 1626078500, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "piggyfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV9RF3BAF1vk1ND9cWg1XVtyg4GKV7H9Ek8AkcAqUbsJH", "voter": "0x7440e1407f95F33206Fb72464A63cd54B2eE6282", "created": 1626078273, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "piggyfinance.eth"}}]}
