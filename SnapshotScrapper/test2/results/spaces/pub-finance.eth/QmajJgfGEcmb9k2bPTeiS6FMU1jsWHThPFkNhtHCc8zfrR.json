{"id": "QmajJgfGEcmb9k2bPTeiS6FMU1jsWHThPFkNhtHCc8zfrR", "title": "Implement PINT scarcity protocol?", "body": "Currently 2.5 PINT are minted every block as a liquidity incentive for the market. The PINT market regularly has over $2M in liquidity, which far surpasses the liquidity present in most other $5M marketcap tokens.\n\nWe propose that the PINT liquidity incentive be dropped down to 1 PINT per block, and total supply be capped at 10,000,000 PINT.  These tokenomic upgrades accomplish three goals which will foster the long-term health of the PINT ecosystem.\n\n1. Dropping the liquidity incentive from 2.5 PINT per block to 1 PINT per block will reduce inflation (and thus potential sell pressure) by 67%.\n\n2. Having $2M in liquidity on a $5M marketcap coin effectively acts as having a thick sell-side in the \"orderbooks,\" which limits price discovery potential from new participants entering the market. Dropping the rewards from 2.5 down to 1 should lead to some of the liquidity leaving the Uniswap pool, while still incentivizing enough to provide a healthy and balanced market.\n\n3. Instituting a hardcap of 10,000,000 on the PINT supply (currently sitting at ~8.1M) provides assurances for buyers that their investments will not be diluted in the future, and is a critical step to PINT achieving its final form as a deflationary asset. With the proposed drop to 1 PINT block reward, this leaves approximately 1 year between today and when that reward will drop to zero (due to the 10M PINT max supply hardcap).   This year creates a generous window within which Wen Rug and other potential pub.finance products will begin to generate revenue and cashflow for the ecosystem, liquidity providers, and stakers.\n\nIn summary, our proposal is that the PINT liquidity incentive block reward drop from 2.5 down to 1 (a 67% reduction), and then automatically be dropped to 0 when the total PINT supply hits 10,000,000 (approximately 1 year from now). These updated tokenomics should allow the market to better reflect growth from new market participants as the PINT community rolls out the new Pub.Finance website, upcoming marketing campaigns, and then the highly anticipated Wen Rug launch later this summer. \n", "choices": ["Drop rewards & hardcap supply", "Drop rewards only", "Hardcap supply only", "Leave tokenomics unchanged"], "start": 1620320400, "end": 1620666000, "snapshot": "12387876", "state": "closed", "author": "0xF82396bb838ce6b8B6aD3aEBD91Da7606bCe0fC2", "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth", "name": "pub-finance"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmR4psGVXNCTgmoQbmdCH5ssX1EXMdCFW7j5sfFUSyhSkZ", "voter": "0x535FAa541252d9650F1F8a8bbd88709FB8b55A1b", "created": 1620652237, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUNgi9NmCm7LqHVrGHUovGBWMZRSNH9Y1k7Sf3nFWtAKJ", "voter": "0xd455C11a7AE24b5A65FC8860B28963C5D311B458", "created": 1620574961, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdUjvyEopkTvhc3NCJZLG77J6Wyq6WkfudTA2Cr4uvxoX", "voter": "0x841c475bc0DbD4c95a7A94b65dF0eDA7631492e1", "created": 1620560215, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme8WQST9Gq7xQWVRhgi9GUKQnknHgARyVoNHZ2Cfn1vcb", "voter": "0x695E76AD8b3760f8A5049BC27830e4CD65FA6c72", "created": 1620494650, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd7pGf2JUp3y69JFgu6W39cnqrmQgrdz2cUdCQed1fGPm", "voter": "0x5F9C36224f52F33D8DAABeDedBD6188c5a43B4F6", "created": 1620424727, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYic2fioGUMh62E8Jz2HazKsVEL8VUZbHEoHU5qLetb49", "voter": "0x54Fc77A98aCB26E98dba4CE18240d0474C16980B", "created": 1620421669, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVD8XULDbQpnS63CdrQjSnEUFMHfzJooNxzoRMJc6n4yV", "voter": "0x7445E7C1Bcb776C279d0f80FDc9953d1f7deDE5f", "created": 1620408948, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNn7i1EX74w8JY9fgefecz9vvMBhiLJBgpDXoGmTcA3Wb", "voter": "0x95A4Ac9070051437263a019028e0fB7F0C9D12a0", "created": 1620404991, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQcp4yDU5VEt2C8GcGodUsDCRQpScp43DvybNn2xeN1eN", "voter": "0xfB866992C660F6bB1abA02f19aa81b8831c3420A", "created": 1620404517, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXWNHVupgjQiyEkAADfzumepngTazGPe4r94y9Rbh3jNE", "voter": "0x54174bb94661EACDb220575134fc4B728cB0eE9a", "created": 1620404473, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbDfn4tSjw6E1xPjSDcGY2KFzgLvM5ZidvvLSCUDcy1x7", "voter": "0xc85c28576A34f8B57a4Df9707630F615128b5Dc5", "created": 1620404377, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYZGTAg5Q95qm9ohN2kFDx7hPH4uxwc8SNAC9eBSxcn9N", "voter": "0x0Dded8017Be12F5568C983259d06a9616E7ce083", "created": 1620404245, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSaqnKWqEXRMKqhkywuNqxNXWZkatE2s5jWZYZ89NnyAC", "voter": "0xA11A765408aA3F90bd804C35Ea59C36811E5d3b6", "created": 1620402787, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQLwxSm2onFvpkfVvvf1nzJYCMiJpY8soaMkbirk2pxFc", "voter": "0xF82396bb838ce6b8B6aD3aEBD91Da7606bCe0fC2", "created": 1620402180, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWhHi269Tw574LMFfdbZvjsF64o9uN6iXrxmdcy6T5bwa", "voter": "0xcDB9a383030084D3f1C164A5F0669FAA037e9237", "created": 1620402154, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTWgv4fHqqmRN7J2QqdRMycaa2fXUDhdDeaiHY4BNPRKj", "voter": "0xD76ED14e9dbB0983489f4a1BBB45EC18AC78B7dF", "created": 1620402136, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pub-finance.eth"}}]}
