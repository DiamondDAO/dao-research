The DAO organizes social events, provides education to the community, and assists in the creation of new blockchain tools.\n\n25 \u2018Genesis\u2019 members, the holders of 25 unique NFTs, compose the voting body of the DAO.\n\nATX DAO is developing an off-chain Discord community into a compliant, on-chain organization composed of the 25 Genesis members. Additional membership tiers may become available as the DAO grows in size.\n\n## **Mission Statement**\n\nWe aim to partner with artists, local businesses, crypto funds, social clubs, and protocols to become the de facto networking resource for crypto in our region.\n\nFor a creator launching an NFT, an engineer building the next DeFi protocol, or an enthusiast investing in the space, ATX DAO aims to be Austin\u2019s local first point of contact.\n\n## **Discord Meeting Structure**\n\nGenesis members will meet weekly, initially Mondays at 5pm.\n\nMeetings are led by a DAO Moderator, elected to a 3 month term. The purpose of the Moderator is to moderate discussion and ensure fair speaking space for equal members. A Scribe, elected to the same term, is responsible for keeping minutes and storing them after the meeting.\n\nThe meeting follows an agenda. It begins with an opening, followed by subcommittee reports, then general business. It ends with a closing review of deliverables.\n\n### Opening\n\n1. Introductions / communal noise\n2. Operational points of order\n\n### Subcommittee Reports\n\n1. Progress updates on existing projects from committee chairs\n\n### General Business\n\n1. Discussion of the week\u2019s proposals, voting on proposals\n2. News, events, upcoming projects\n3. Additional business added by the Moderator\n\n### Closing\n\n1. Deliverables review\n\nAfter each meeting, the agenda and minutes are stored in a group folder for reference.\n\n## **Subcommittees:**\n\n1. Operations (meetings, proposal management, record keeping)\n2. Strategic Partnerships (planning, promotion, fund-raising)\n3. Marketing and Events (community, social media, recruiting, web)\n4. Engineering (minting, on-chain ops)\n5. Membership (new member apps, onboarding)\n\nEach subcommittee has a Chair who is responsible for speaking to their action items in the general meeting.\n\nGenesis members deliberate on a process for distributing subcommittee membership and electing subcommittee chairs.\n\n## **Advancing a Proposal**\n\nPost a proposal by EOD Friday before a Monday meeting to have it discussed in session preceding a Snapshot vote.\n\nAlternatively, raise an idea during general business, then submit a proposal before the next Friday to have it discussed in that session.\n\n## **Voting**\n\nOff-chain voting occurs in the Discord using a simple majority thumbs, for points of order and procedural decisions in weekly meetings.\n\nFormal proposals are posted by proposal owners on the ATX DAO Snapshot page, where Genesis NFT holders cast on-chain votes.\n\nAdditional on-chain voting procedures may be adopted as the organization evolves.\n\n## **Record Keeping / Storage**\n\nThe Moderator builds the agenda for each meeting before the Monday session. After a meeting, the Scribe saves meeting minutes to the group folder and notes any proposals that were passed, along with the vote tally.\n\nA Notion folder containing meeting minutes and approved proposals allows members to reference past deliberations.\n\n\n\n\nBe it resolved that:  ATX DAO ratify this operational blueprint.", "choices": ["For", "Against", "Request Revision"], "start": 1637337600, "end": 1637647200, "snapshot": "13646424", "state": "closed", "author": "0x781198E9517C414b6d5BD84b99c82FE864da9998", "space": {"id": "atxdao.eth", "name": "ATX DAO"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xfba6303bf5858b6d920a6f56d19b4a7104e4bb618ffe8b06112f6e188faa8580", "voter": "0x0c90D90f0d38c21ecB15d5Bd32B030977eeB2e31", "created": 1637623692, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "atxdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x9a295b93125a342d0d4d907507d4e46759d8b51483ab9517b2712f3c926fd9d6", "voter": "0x982Efa073Aeebb95a0Cb7D025f002D9B56F66Bdb", "created": 1637600506, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "atxdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xccff3338f40b659a82577ea34620da50eef242b77764c8dafeb7543b0e0566ae", "voter": "0xf83b3A823653E8351b173Fa2Ae083Af37EAbCC01", "created": 1637596268, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "atxdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x69b203aca3d6ced00a4a71472fb8c409bf62c5b2c0334b3bdda56778608b628b", "voter": "0x5A17717abE73FEb3d4C4AAfD39B3CA5313cFB653", "created": 1637337861, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "atxdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x3c76f5c806601169ca535e44139315d6aabce98a6c9ff80b45e66a3e9eba4543", "voter": "0x781198E9517C414b6d5BD84b99c82FE864da9998", "created": 1637337804, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "atxdao.eth"}}]}
