Ltd discontinued offical Pay and TenX-Token and offer these as a exchange \n\n0.24 MIMO per PAY / 0.37 MIMO per TENX\n\nIf you \"Hodl\" Pay-Token (and claim the TenX) it is 1 MiMo-Token for 0.61 \"Pay/TENX\" combined.\n\nTenX-Token and Pay-Token combined had a circulating supply around 400 Mio. and the new Token MiMo 1 billion. \n\nThe reduced amount of distribution to old token holders was due to the idea to attract also new people that come into the MiMo-World.\n\nThe claim period for Pay/TenX-Token is 1 year (until 09.04.2022)\n\nMiMo Capital Ltd. can build cause people trusted in the old \"TenX-Team\" (parts of it are also in the new MiMo-Team :-)) and gave them some Money in exchange for Pay-Tokens to build something incredible.\n___\nI suggest \n\n- (if not all MiMo-Tokens claimed by their rightful owners until 09.04.2022)\n\nThe remaining MiMo-Tokens after the deadline (I think in total around 3-4% of the total supply) should be split between the adresses that claimed MiMo-Tokens with Pay/TenX-Token (excluded the ones held by TenX/MiMo Capital Ltd. to avoid a centralization of the Gov-System).\n\nThis is not a proposal that change the protocol - but I totally think that should be decided by the MiMo-Token-Holders.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "choices": ["Yes, I agree", "No, I disagree"], "start": 1625911200, "end": 1628589600, "snapshot": "12791401", "state": "closed", "author": "0xCcaed28d9694e9C2bD0F544Ac871dA27D8f449FA", "space": {"id": "mimo.eth", "name": "MIMO Mainnet"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmW1aLn9V1mJ9oLys2KPhSA9V5GWp3Kzb2Q3ThLorc5kP3", "voter": "0xEAD1D440ED15Fc5ef1F23F8F80467c6167e2bf93", "created": 1628429475, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mimo.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRD4L24Xa4wCrDeaRjHgsqCtv26twniwPtm53c2VoshHT", "voter": "0xa5C85Ace1429d8652c40B27eAe3e894Eba518871", "created": 1628126588, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mimo.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXbqAWDPbqWUFder9VjNQyDKhNuPx3miag2zdydPeA9PC", "voter": "0xF6bE906cf0066B4a07F8119E4Ec5f4EF8CB32C67", "created": 1627736062, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mimo.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdfRcA9k3F4XjorMv2upX7apS7qS6HGDacyhB5aXn4zRe", "voter": "0x35b3e718aAfd5F932450eeb8690D022a96AAd78a", "created": 1625918100, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mimo.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRDcFPnCjgAfXC549wCDnF5QG4QN79bELqi7My2U9rU5z", "voter": "0x0B18529885dd76A515553435AfC9B2A065043B3b", "created": 1625913458, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mimo.eth"}}]}
