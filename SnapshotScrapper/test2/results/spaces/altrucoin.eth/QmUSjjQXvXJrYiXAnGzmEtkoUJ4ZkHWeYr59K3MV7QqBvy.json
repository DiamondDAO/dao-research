Instead of voting on a charity, this week we would like to get your vote on a potential partnership with an organization called International Animal Rescue.\n\nWe have been organizing a partnership with International Animal Rescue on their \u201cRebuild the Refuge\u201d project in the Costa Rican Rainforest that helps rescue, rehabilitate, and release injured animals back into the rainforest. To learn more about them, feel free to visit their website, https://www.internationalanimalrescue.org/ . And, to learn about the project, visit https://www.internationalanimalrescue.org/projects/howler-monkeys . This organization has also been a partner with Wildlife SOS, a wonderful organization we previously donated to, for almost 20 years. \n\nWe were planning on organizing a fundraiser event with the goal of $10K. The fundraiser will be marketed to the Altrucoin community as well as the IAR community. Additionally, we will match the donations up to $5K. \nThroughout the fundraising event, IAR will:\n          -Announce to their audience about the Altrucoin fundraiser\n          -Engage with our social media posts about the fundraiser\n          -Send updates through their mailing lists and social media platforms about Altrucoin and the event\n          -Include Altrucoin in a press release about the fundraising event\n          -Include Altrucoin in a press release to thank us and reveal the amount raised\n          -Include Altrucoin on their crypto webpage with our logo and name\nAfter the donation is made, IAR will,\n          -Fund their project to help Costa Rican wildlife\n          -Name an animal enclosure after our cryptocurrency, Altrucoin!\n\nPlease vote either yes or no as to whether you would like us to make this donation and marketing partnership happen!\n\nIf you have a suggestion for any charities you would like to see in future voting, please leave a comment here: https://forms.gle/uso4Ummhkm15iy9XA\nWe tend to prioritize charities that accept cryptocurrency. We are currently working on getting in touch with some of the charities you guys have suggested to try and see if they will accept crypto, and also working on donating to some Canadian organizations, which I know many people have requested. Thank you to all of the people who have made suggestions!\n", "choices": ["Yes,let's do the partnership!", "No,let's use the funds elsewhere"], "start": 1629791100, "end": 1630083600, "snapshot":
