Is it time to evolve Season 2 into its final stage, Season 2.9.9?\n\nDue to the unfortunate circumstances following the Season 2 launch, the Rope community quickly rallied to replace the existing art with temporary, community-created art. \n\nHowever, there is a large portion of the community who would still like to see the art from Season 2.0.1 be replaced with higher quality art, as originally polled in the Snapshot. There is also a large portion of the community who would like keep the art from Season 2.0.1. as it has sentimental/meme value. \n\nThe proposal in this snapshot is an amalgamation of existing snapshots and community discussion.\n\nThe idea is to make as many people happy as possible, but clean up our storefront and retain our art's legitimacy. In order to attempt to appease all of the Rope community, we have come up with the following proposal:\n\nSeason 2: Moonbase - The Game\nSeason 2.0.1: Noombase - The Game\nSeason 2.9.9 (Final Form): Noombased\n\n1. Update the official S2.0.1 art on all of the cards to the same content, but w/ much higher quality art.\n\n2. Allow all users to keep the cards after update, or burn them if they choose.\n\n3. All users have 2 options if they choose to burn their S2.0.1 cards:\n    Option A: Burn cards for HOPE, at a specific HOPE rate for each rarity tier, and an increased HOPE rate for burning an entire set.\n\n    Option B: Burn new cards for original S2.0.1 cards (w/ MSPaint art), under a different store front (Noombase - The Game), rather than Rope Makers United, to keep our storefront clean.\n\nThis would allow anyone who wants to, to retain the original art in an official NFT, and it would be even more rare, keeping S2.0.1 collectors happy.\n\nIt would also allow anyone who wants to, to replace the MSPaint art w/ high quality art, or with HOPE to get new art in S3, keeping those who don't like this season happy.
