Cyclone has been successfully launched on IoTeX, BSC, and Ethereum, and has gained many fans.\n\n# Proposal\n\nThe proposal suggests refilling the following pools that are about to finish their first 90 days of the mission, yet still very active in terms of TVL. Once passed, additional CYC will be minted and injected into these pools to support them operate for another 90 days with the proposed amount of anonymity/liquidity reward. In addition, this proposal also suggests changing some of the original parameters of these pools.\n\n### BSC - Pool C3PO\n\nAsset: 100 BNB\n\nLife Cycle: 90 days\n\nAnonymity Mining v2: 3 CYC per day\n\n### BSC - Pool R2D2\n\nAsset: 10,000 BUSD\n\nLife Cycle: 90 days\n\nAnonymity Mining v2: 1 CYC per day\n\n### BSC - Pool BB8\n\nAsset: 25,000 IOTX\n\nLife Cycle: 90 days\n\nAnonymity Mining v2: 0.5 CYC per day\n\n### BSC - Pool Jonny5\n\nAsset: 3 CYC\n\nLife Cycle: 90 days\n\nAnonymity Mining v2: 2 CYC per day\n\n## ETH - Pool Latte\n\nAsset: 100 ETH\n\nLife Cycle: 90 days\n\nAnonymity Mining v2: 3 CYC per day\n\n## ETH - Pool Espresso\n\nAsset: 100,000 USDT\n\nLife Cycle: 90 days\n\nAnonymity Mining v2: 3 CYC per day\n\n## ETH - Pool Cold Brew\n\nAsset: 100 TORN\n\nLife Cycle: 90 days\n\nAnonymity Mining v2: 0.15 CYC per day\n\n### CYC-ETH Liquidity Pool\n\nAsset: CYC-ETH LP\n\nLife Cycle: 90 days\n\nLiquidity Mining: 20 CYC per day\n\n# The Vote\n\nThis proposal needs to be approved via a vote by the community before execution.\n\n# Discussion\n\nPlease discuss this proposal in this forum thread.", "choices": ["Yes, refill!", "No, stop!"], "start": 1624122000, "end": 1624208400, "snapshot": "8436546", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4891f20A4C681DE9aB75AF9523e2f070A26f9a20", "space": {"id": "realcycloneprotocol.eth", "name": "Cyclone Protocol"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
