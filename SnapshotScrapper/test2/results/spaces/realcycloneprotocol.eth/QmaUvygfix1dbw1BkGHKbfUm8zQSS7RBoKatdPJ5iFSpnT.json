Cyclone has been successfully launched on IoTeX, BSC, Ethereum and Polygon.\n\n# Proposal\n\nThe proposal suggests refilling the following pools that are about to finish their first 90 days of the mission, yet still very active in terms of TVL. Once passed, additional CYC will be minted and injected into these pools on 10/25 0:00AM UTC to support them operate for another 90 days with the proposed amount of anonymity/liquidity reward.\n\n## Polygon - Pool Pentagon\n\nAsset: 1,000 MATIC\n\nLife Cycle: 90 days\n\nAnonymity Mining v2: 0.06 CYC per day\n\n## Polygon - Pool Hexagon\n\nAsset: 1,000 USDC\n\nLife Cycle: 90 days\n\nAnonymity Mining v2: 0.03 CYC per day\n\n## Polygon - Pool Octagon\n\nAsset: 2 QUICK\n\nLife Cycle: 90 days\n\nAnonymity Mining v2: 0.03 CYC per day\n\n## CYC-MATIC Liquidity Pool\n\nAsset: CYC/MATIC LP\n\nLife Cycle: 90 days\n\nLiquidity Mining: 20 CYC per day\n\n# The Vote\n\nThis proposal needs to be approved via a vote by the community before execution.\n\n# Discussion\n\nPlease discuss this proposal in this forum thread.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1634965200, "end": 1635051600, "snapshot": "11997114", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4891f20A4C681DE9aB75AF9523e2f070A26f9a20", "space": {"id": "realcycloneprotocol.eth", "name": "Cyclone Protocol"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmR3KJ7X1cjagiuiJZZ6E9ApYn2R61iAGyPyuVStHxsLtr", "voter": "0x7f1fDbE3CdAcdf7808E8c97ff81c5d2FccaE37b4", "created": 1634988219, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "realcycloneprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbGBZsonQ9vLbwCUcNCdqTxeC78MJwGteeX6QDtGLaySi", "voter": "0x6200Ee9c5474AA0bBd0DcE1d87D9E4f2C50bEd3C", "created": 1634978773, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "realcycloneprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf4LnCKTjSZjhN6BJ4jDWrKmTDKrzr1Z7w3EBHoEfVsgk", "voter": "0x48e65b37164D038B8AB5F193d7EA16CfFcADF634", "created": 1634970566, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "realcycloneprotocol.eth"}}]}
