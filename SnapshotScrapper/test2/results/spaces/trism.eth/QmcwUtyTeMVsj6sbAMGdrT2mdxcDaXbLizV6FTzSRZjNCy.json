{"id": "QmcwUtyTeMVsj6sbAMGdrT2mdxcDaXbLizV6FTzSRZjNCy", "title": "Short term farming proposal", "body": "To reward long-term holders of trism and also to provide additional liquidity pool options short-term I'm suggesting we allocate 10,000 trism from 'Trism: Fund and Asset wallet' to a farm at: https://valueliquid.io/#/faas/ starting on 22nd January and lasting approximately 2 months.   This platform allows users to withdraw yield without withdrawing their liquidity.   It also does not require tokens are added into a liquidity pairing reducing costs.\n\nThis is a short-term proposal whilst awaiting a longer-term farm yield solution for 'top-up' and 'open ended' farming at unicrypt (due to be available end Feb-ish). The idea being that by the time this pool finishes, we should have an open ended pool based on Uniswap LP's that can be topped up.\n\nMy view is that a significant price correction event (drop) for BTC and ETH is coming and trism will benefit by having a USDC stable pair which rewards people who add liquidity.\n\nBased on estimated calculations the pool reward (when asset allocation is 50:50) is as follows:\n$0.07 Trism price, $10,000 liquidity - 43% APY (pro-rata for the 2 month duration)\n$0.14 Trism price, $10,000 liquidity - 86% APY (pro-rata for the 2 month duration)\n\nIn order to protect trism value and encourage USDC stability/USDC price growth, I'm proposing a range of pool ratio scaling options (USDC vs trism) for vote as well as an option not to use proceeds in the farm.\n\nBy having a larger proportion of USDC required e.g. 80% USDC: 20% Trism the price will be more stable/encourage competition, but also potentially encourage growth from people outside of trism as the IL loss potential is low.\n\nInfinity", "choices": ["NO FARM, keep the trism", "Yes!
