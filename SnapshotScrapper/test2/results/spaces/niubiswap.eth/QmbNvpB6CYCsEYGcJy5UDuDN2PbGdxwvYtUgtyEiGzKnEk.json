We have seen the effects the tokenomics of NIU have had on its price and the sustainability of the Yield Farming Platform we provide. We\u2019ve already voted to change the NIUPOT system, along with burning tokens to reduce the dilution of the total token supply, but we\u2019re looking to go a step further and adopt a more effective way to sustain yield farming while providing value to the network.\n\nWith plenty of options to consider, we ran across a concept that could drastically effect the Niubiswap platform in a positive way. This concept is based on the fact that many DeFi YF platforms are negatively affected by bots, front runners, and idle holders who aren\u2019t contributing to the network. The way in which NIU can get a hold on its supply being too hyperinflated is by changing the tokenomics slightly while adding incentives to participate in staking and governance voting.\n\nThe innovation doesn\u2019t stop there. We want to introduce our NIU Vault as we know many of our users are currently staking tokens like DOT, BTCB, BNB and ETH in our LPs or Hongbao Zone. We want to utilize these idle tokens in our pools to find higher rewards to bring extra gains to our holders. When you choose to get the added yield incentive we will lock the NIU in our NIU Vault. When staking in our NIU vault, users can choose the duration of the commitment ranging from 3 day, 7 day, 30 day, or 60 day period, the longer the holding period the higher the rewards/yields obtained from holders! The result of this is users start gaining NIU from staking in NIU in addition to the extra rewards obtained in the NIU vault. This in turn will help users lock in NIU for longer periods of time, which will reduce selling pressure while providing high % yield. \n\nThis is what we believe will be a large draw for new community members and those interested in the project, as they will be able to stake X amount of tokens and receive extra yield on their inactive crypto. It pays to be a hodler!\nOur ultimate goal is to generate more rewards for our holders in our NIU Vault that are staking and participating in the platform. With the community's help, we can generate an ecosystem with valuable passive yield that our holders can receive directly. The fees calculated by the platform will be used to buy back tokens and burn them. This will also decrease the tokens supply while also putting even more back into the communities pockets.\n\nPlease VOTE on your thoughts of Niubiswap implementing NIU Vault into our core features.\n", "choices": ["Agree, to Implement NIU Vault", "Disagree, Keep it the way is now", "I trust Niubiswap Vision", "I will not farm here "], "start": 1618833600, "end": 1619179200, "snapshot": "6701398", "state": "closed", "author": "0x56ceb573C2155B17C57FfafEA67721aF813A2C53", "space": {"id": "niubiswap.eth", "name": "NiubiSwap"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWAApXmcGLQqUZfUFbrvcBVad4nL2LSZKvYWtWgsAf6e8", "voter": "0x7965F431635c365CC2175Ab6E7c9b1AC724156c1", "created": 1618852822, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "niubiswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYGXB2uQCgtMh8EKgoNb9rjzcGDt37QumqYn32xptYxsf", "voter": "0x286f1B5b4DCd582816f18D0C9BAE57c6279a80f3", "created": 1618851329, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "niubiswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWvfXwHytUzsmNg9YYfqcYzsRPfuu81VPTw5FSHc8shYP", "voter": "0x0f8BcFDE458554919Ac0D2869bc657a73d072a91", "created": 1618847974, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "niubiswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXeu6sq9PFXjY2U6MX6pDt165rkLVbVPArjuPcEYj9aHm", "voter": "0x9Df4Cb4345B8b8f4a6467615b2dc4CfAAfeD09C9", "created": 1618843806, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "niubiswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXSVhAqUjyTCCyeX7s2WpFf9UrC4MhYtJh7KrDcDpDWSr", "voter": "0x3665A7e30F18e8F5238ed81f423a89EF2695A7C4", "created": 1618842323, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "niubiswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcNTgYu85jkP764rZ11wckwdo1daGE1Kj6zfhmTTAKF49", "voter": "0x16149e6D0fE6Dea0dfE3733D5102CA0B6F67D34f", "created": 1618836730, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "niubiswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWXULwrXvE7cKwzQahVGDRs9UmSrb1kpL9UAXJyeFRNMY", "voter": "0x5C5c5b190b30E29f4b3275bC7cF99550803b7d3d", "created": 1618836039, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "niubiswap.eth"}}]}
