Time to decentralize.\n\n## Lessons in Skin in the Game from Nassim Nicholas Taleb\n\n## Niubi current token economy\n\n300 000 NIU per day \n- 60% to Niubi Zone (FARMS)\n- 30% to Hongbao Zone (POOLS)\n- 10% to Niubi Dev Fund (current managed by the chinese core team, will progressively be managed by YOU, NIU holders) : still untouched from day 1. 0$/0 NIU sold !!!\n\non those 30000 NIU/day, \n- 20% Dev Fund reserve (6000 NIU) \n- 10% Team & Op (6000 NIU) \n- 10% Daily Special lottery (3000 NIU / 50% for the winner - 50% burned) \n- 10% Burn from Dev Fund (3000 NIU) \n- 40% Investment Fund to reward Hongbao (12000 NIU)\n\nDev Fund reserve, Team & Op represent: 12000 NIU per days, \n6000 currently distributed to the Niubiswap developer, and Niubiswap strategist as contributors. \n\nThe Chinese team is not touching any NIU for the moment and holding to build a long term project.\nIt means we have 6000 NIU/day to distribute to Niubiswap contributors, developers, designers, marketers, as a decentralized and autonomous company, we will decide collectively how to use those funds.\n\nWe will progressively give governance on the investment fund as well to be able to catch any solid opportunities to give more rewards to our NIU holders, and Hongbao stakers.\n\n---\n\n# Niubi Open decision-making\n\n## Steps to a Decision\n\nOpen decision-making involves four steps\n- Collect input widely\n- Facilitate consensus\n- Announce the decision clearly\n- Don't reconsider the decision unless there is significant new information\n\n## What to decide ?\n\n- Global strategy\n- Niubi Dev Fund allocation\n- Team & Op (6000 NIU/day)\n- Development (6000 NIU/day)\n- Investment Fund (to rewards Hongbao NIU stakers and NIU shareholders) (12000 NIU /day)\n- New features\n- Setup parameters / fees / % / allocation / multipliers / etc.\n\n## When and how do we start ?\n\nRight now, every day starting from tomorrow, we will publish several proposals to vote, and decide collectively how to spend the dev funds and validate all our decisions and strategy by the community. If voted with more than 60%, proposals will be executed after:\n- specs validation \n- cost estimation\n- contributor hiring/ selected by community (Worker Proposal)\n\nThe current founder team has several resources and contributors, including independent developers, designers, marketers, and more.

Discord will be used for more serious conversations with direct contributors and builders. For each official open proposals:\n- dedicated Telegram Channel\n- dedicated  Telegram Group\n- dedicated Discord channel\n\n## Snapshot DAO quick guideline\n\nPartnering with the famous Snapshot app with our own Niubiswap space to manage our DAO. Every NIU Members will be able to participate in the governance process using their wallet and NIU token to vote on Snapshot.\n\nWe will start with:\n- Official Proposals: made by initial support team\n- Worker proposals: to respond to call for contributors, for specific mission or any spontaneous application)\n- Suggestions: bring your nice ideas, and get it voted by the community and implemented, get rewards/tips for your contributions\n\nAll contributor posts should include author wallet address, with the following. \n\"To tips my contribution, send NIU to 0x............\" \n\nThe community will be then able to vote and tips best contributions to the Niubiswap strategy.
