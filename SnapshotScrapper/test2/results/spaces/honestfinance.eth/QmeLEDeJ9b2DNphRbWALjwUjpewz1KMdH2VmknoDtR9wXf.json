This mechanism limits the harvesting frequency. It's designed to prevent farming arbitrage bots from constantly harvesting and dumping.\n\nFor example: The harvest lockup of the HTY-BUSD farm is 2 hours. This means that farmers who stake in the HTY-BUSD farm can only harvest (claim their rewards from farming.) every 2 hours.\nTo clarify: This locks only farming REWARDS. The tokens and LPs staked in farms can be withdrawn anytime.\n", "choices": ["2 hours", "3 hours", "4 hours"], "start": 1622086020, "end": 1622221200, "snapshot": "7762705", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB1129a946404EC21d00630503aA4AD9EA38A35aB", "space": {"id": "honestfinance.eth", "name": "HONEST Yield Farm"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTMH6tPR3wc3P7bEbxbsHBAbyzXZvqPZubNgHgVN4GQjH", "voter": "0xCf2b7f6Ae354a45BCdAB43a9066421b9774E0a12", "created": 1622091140, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "honestfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVMEaNE51Jzjwbei2HpSAQaPAZCCzbZwuWTA8fZDuBAup", "voter": "0xC3BD32fA215B19aa528Ae87D29A19288941B8646", "created": 1622088655, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "honestfinance.eth"}}]}
