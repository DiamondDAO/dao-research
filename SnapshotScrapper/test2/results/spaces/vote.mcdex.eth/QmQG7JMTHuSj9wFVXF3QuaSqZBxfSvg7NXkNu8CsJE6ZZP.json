MCDEX achieved a $170m TVL and $100m daily volume. \n\nI suggest extending the program for another six epochs (12 weeks) after epoch 0 ends.\n\n### Aim:\n 1) Onboard more users\n 2) Onboard marketmakers (aggregators)\n 3) Increase Liquidity pool and volume\n\n## Changes\n\nWe shall make some minor changes to the term of epoch 0 as follow:\n\n###  Fee Factor\nBecause we are planning to introduce more perpetual contracts and different contracts may have different fee settings,  we shall use the fee paid to the DAO, instead of the total fee, in the trading mining formula. Thus, no matter what the fee rate of the perceptual is, we only take the fee paid to the DAO into account when calculating the fee score. The fee paid to the DAO is a fair factor to measure the contribution of the trader to the Ecos-system. \n\nThe fee paid to the DAO contains:\n- Treasury fee (0.015% on all the networks)\n- Operator fee if MCDEX DAO is the operator of the pool (variable, 0.025% on BSC)\n\nIf the perceptual has a fee rebate setting, the rebate should be excluded from the fee score.\n\n### MCB Re-stake\nCurrently, traders stake MCB tokens for 100-day to participate in the trading mining program. The lock-time decreases day by day, decreasing the staking score of the trader. We shall allow the trader to re-stake their MCB to maintain their staking score. After re-staking, the lock-time will be reset to 100-day.\n\n## Mining Program\n\n### Reward Schedule\n\nI suggest allocate the epochs some MCB as the mining rewards and decrease the rewards linearly. The rewards should be separated into two parts: 10% for liquidity mining and 90% for trading mining.\n\n| Epoch | Time | Total Rewards | Liquidity Mining | Trading Mining |\n|:--:|:-:|:-:|:--:|:-:|\n| 1 | Oct 18 ~ Oct 31 | 80k MCB | 8k MCB | 72k MCB\n| 2 | Nov 1 ~ Nov 14 | 70k MCB | 7k MCB | 64k MCB\n| 3 | Nov 15 ~ Nov 28 | 60k MCB | 6k MCB | 54k MCB\n| 4 | Nov 29 ~ Dec 12  | 50k MCB | 5k MCB | 45k MCB\n| 5 | Dec 13 ~ Dec 26 | 40k MCB | 4k MCB | 36k MCB\n| 6 | Dec 27 ~ Jan 9  | 30k MCB | 3k MCB | 27k MCB\n\nThe MCDEX DAO can change the schedule via governance if necessary.\n\n### Liquidity Mining\n\nMCB rewards shall distribute to the LPs who add liquidity to the MCDEX AMM. The foundation shall choose the proper pools for the mining program and allocate the rewards among the pools.\n\n### Trading Mining\n\nMCB will be distributed to traders based on a formula that rewards a combination of fees paid, open interest, and staking score. MCB will be distributed on a 14-day epoch basis and is not subject to any vesting or lockups. The number of MCB of each epoch is determined by MCDEX DAO governance.\n\nThe function below is used to compute how much MCB is awarded to each trader during each epoch:\n\n$$\nw=f^{\\alpha } \\cdot d^{\\beta} \\cdot s^{\\gamma}\n$$\n\n$$\nr=R\\cdot \\frac{w}{\\sum_{n}{w_{n}}}\n$$\n\n| Term | Definition |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n|r| Reward for a specific trader.|\n|R| Total reward to be split between all traders in the pool for the epoch.|\n|w| Individual trader score.|\n|f| Total fees paid by a trader to the **MCDEX DAO** in this epoch.|\n|d| A trader\u2019s average open interest (measured every minute) across all selected markets in this epoch.|\n|s| A traders\u2019 average MCB staking score (measured every minute) in this epoch.|\n|\u03b1| A constant that determines the weight of fees. The initial value is \u03b1= 0.7.|\n|\u03b2| A constant that determines the weight of open interest. The initial value is \u03b2=0.3.|\n|\u03b3| A constant that determines the weight of the staking score. The initial value is \u03b3=0.3.|\n\n### MCB Staking Score\n\nA trader can obtain *Staking Score* by locking MCB in the staking smart contract. The lock time of staking is **100 days**.\n\nThe **Staking Score (s)** is defined as follows:\n$$\ns=n\\cdot t\n$$\n\n| Term | Definition |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n|n|The number of staked MCB.|\n|t|The remaining lock time in days.|\n\n#### Update of Lock Time\n\nIf the trader stakes multi-times, the remaining lock time is the weighted average value of each staking.\n\nSupposing a trader has n staked MCB and the remaining lock time is t, if he stakes another `m` MCB, the remaining lock time `t` is updated as follows:\n\n$$\nt=\\frac{t\\cdot n+T\\cdot m}{n+m}\n$$\n\nThe initial value of **T** is **100 days**, which can be changed by MCDEX DAO governance.\n\nThe trader can reset the lock-time to **T** at any time.\n\n### Multi-chain\nSince MCDEX has a multi-chain strategy, the mining program shall be deployed to multi-chain either. The foundation shall add chains to the program step by step during the epochs.\n\nThe Trader Staking Scores shall be shared across the chains. Thus, the staking score shall be the sum of the scores on the chains.\n$$\ns = \\sum_{n}{s_{n}}\n$$\n\n\n___\n\nI suggest the community discuss this proposal.\n\n**Note**\uff1a I will modify the proposal draft according to the feedback of the community before voting.\n\n---\n### Notice from Admin\nMCB is deployed to  Ethereum and BSC, to make more ppl can participate in the governance, we will leverage snapshot.org to vote. Unfortunately, Snapshot removed Arbitrum support recently. **Holders on Arbitrum have no voting power.** In order to vote on the proposal, MCB holders on Arbitrum have to transfer their MCB to BSC via Anyswap.io before the snapshot is created (Oct 14th).\n\nThe ppl below will have vote power:\n\n- Etherum:\n  - MCB holders\n  - Uniswap v2 LP\n  - Uniswap v3 LP\n- BSC\n  -  MCB holders\n  - Traders who staked MCB", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1634286600, "end": 1634373000, "snapshot": "13421553", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5D80B049fa92c881fD271B3A8974Cd2Ac338B513", "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth", "name": "MCDEX"}, "votes": 23, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZxPHsiyFL1VVD1KpvohnG2j4CcPySpMUb6kHrKuZWSHk", "voter": "0x4ae8DEE857A0C73FAd839c827da44584DdBF2827", "created": 1634370922, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXUQgypqZY1wCWLeU1RQocLcyCQuNgGZuUNZR8zDPWjB9", "voter": "0x1FA762d0d00e31b837E261b32dB5C446c0af8267", "created": 1634319820, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma8bs5kZJJCRZJ3nkqk6Mx9YSbwBLm6s1TmrqhBDKTSCA", "voter": "0x8875a6B3E85fEbF1F4773CcA059A8c0C6DdA6485", "created": 1634290608, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR2Rqs6n9wJZPBSzhKjs25M5tKyRPHsxgeh62JHXrvDfr", "voter": "0x5FEDBE7b8DeceAd5c3B396A125c9911581Cd8B7d", "created": 1634289368, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdS63v5vqT8dfsT1bwkA1zwbPH6YdMDbMEak6CwerVbq6", "voter": "0xd672A08a65071CC5c2b962E47CC1072957011094", "created": 1634289319, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRdmC7qoqvwxvLA55b7jdY2mVTvVLVcjz62Lj3RQti6YC", "voter": "0xadFd9A5E0B44DBDA4b27151c23201CC3EEf8Ea44", "created": 1634289260, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSqpgiYiUoJD27GRvdMP9xgSGbR8z2YEj5s58tvcGxqJf", "voter": "0x64524218879e96D9a11d48994219E389B55369B1", "created": 1634288827, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcxDeeBAAvE9vNjtLQgxv1c3VJMwHN2DLx1iDBLRv7mVd", "voter": "0xa11E04460EC463211503A11dDB93a6248B174063", "created": 1634288571, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPEwCa5GSWgp8jBFfA4hMtbYkma7i2kMtqt6GC6Cjijhb", "voter": "0x7de4ffA6081D4C1109979418343D6EfBd2343f88", "created": 1634288483, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRbK7hJvZMTVP9Hj8HGZHSog8AUH6yx15psaYEze84ehR", "voter": "0x311e0FAd39B06F2ce7aBe03303E32362F63BAc10", "created": 1634288316, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNzhkHNaXH1hcyMTWEuZSB2MCKkfjFV1UVUYuXF7DeRQ7", "voter": "0x68Aa5450B01960Ac529556a727c89EA39599C4F0", "created": 1634288298, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVYa3xK3LYa64ceKByHCFgma7sDhHbQWtLPgib1NFhkAL", "voter": "0x924cEDb12A1eF912715Ca42E2d9964bF564c29EB", "created": 1634288245, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbfVu6HAqVEUj3ugt7u2Uj7T8F1sd2WcXdQjBi5DuSgxE", "voter": "0xeBc462355194903ad1AD32fa767B3B74D5acA278", "created": 1634288164, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVM2kXGap2CsBj2PjrqzSF3MP5ZDGS3WqcshG5gLanJn5", "voter": "0xAb539874026f95dc4Fe56F93626E0C677dBBC41f", "created": 1634287475, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXNSNG428iEsq9jgi7RtAk5xQsqdSdpaSQFUZmrf3ENM7", "voter": "0x9D56e97d586c605790bd304952f4E4c83EC37022", "created": 1634287042, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVCsyJpveXTEqgTCq5FvqRAZzq3Hzk2eXLnMVtFKP4DPC", "voter": "0x21a0063d36411A11b806e5ED63FBc0631B459245", "created": 1634287003, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfC1rjxy3kimnKxnC1wvd7x3GP5AxNhpRQL3sJnHApnpX", "voter": "0x17AE398aeF4C0227601Bb40675e81e08dF4f59DE", "created": 1634286968, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTcrGmRiAEbPyuR2qZ6vk6WViqQTetE1UR8cmUTSUH5WA", "voter": "0x0B49f8f8eC743b76FEa08b4c8F3077f7FFE1a0Fd", "created": 1634286819, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUAf9rmX3qZD6N5AWY8S9zQPVhfEvkx7CYT1a1crRwvwt", "voter": "0x7503C436f8a538182078eA9E382E52C01136a544", "created": 1634286818, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaBiJ7GSmEQBQcmnmcTW66LHNwWFtanryCSSFnsVALCrf", "voter": "0xF3930CBB9E0391306e7441565167aC00285a3Dfe", "created": 1634286765, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQpC8CfLkuj2d7VVGpFhUxp6tNbX1eoA6bgWfzNvSwqF4", "voter": "0x8223015ed5484fF66a9033f40931aE3Dea22Cb90", "created": 1634286757, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVQoWEXytkafvsQQeMWQ9ihMNabzVSvoUi8C3EFJaKhf1", "voter": "0x12dB413CCD720B38a9d32f9E26A73b624598F176", "created": 1634286747, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmewhC1wmDGRRLj7DyLcWiPsBkgbMZ2ZF7WvsLrtVjXnox", "voter": "0x5D80B049fa92c881fD271B3A8974Cd2Ac338B513", "created": 1634286611, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.mcdex.eth"}}]}
