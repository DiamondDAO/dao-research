{"id": "QmcNhz4Yedm9SWBpXzkhj22xrCQgJiZxBydCLyDfw9xb2o", "title": "Proposal Inverter Spec and Model - TEC Labs Collaboration", "body": "The proposal inverter must be built. This has been made clear by the many DAOs calling for its creation, including PrimeDAO. This will be a beneficial collaboration between Longtail Financial, Token Engineering Commons, Commons Stack, BlockScience, Curve Labs, and PrimeDAO. \n\n\u2028The \u2018Proposal Inverter\u2019 is a high-demand DeFi component since the inception of the DAO ecosystem. It was documented in the original Commons Stack work as the \u2018giveth proposal engine\u2019. More recently, it has been written about in collaboration with BlockScience and PrimeDAO in \u2018Exploring DAO2DAO Collaborations\u2019 https://medium.com/primedao/exploring-dao2dao-collaboration-mechanisms-c37218a17a21 \u2028\u2028\nThe proposal inverter inverts the DAO-proposal relationship. Such that, instead of having many proposals for a single DAO, we will have many DAOs for a single proposal. This enables the collaborative funding of proposals that benefit multiple DAOs throughout the ecosystem. You can think of this as solving the byzantine general's problem for the collective funding of public goods for DAOs.\n\n\nThe specifications and modelling development is happening publicly through the Token Engineering Commons Lab. The lab has an open development session every Friday 9amPST/6pmCEST in the TEC discord. Longtail Financial is pooling additional development resources towards the modelling and spec. BlockScience is providing advisory, particularly through Dr.Z\u2019s Open Research Office Hours and the previous iterations of modelling that have been done on the topic. \n\n\nNote that this proposal is for the creation of the Proposal Inverter specification and cadCAD model. After the completion of the spec and model, smart contracts must be developed, which may be a future proposal. It has been indicated that Curve Labs has the resources to develop the contracts upon completion of the spec and model.\n\n\nRequesting: 35k USDC + 35k Prime Tokens\n\nSent to: 0x8C6e8021de64150BF374640Eaf7732542D93aEb8\u2028\u2028\n\n07/30/2021 to 10/18/2021", "choices": ["Yay!", "Nay!"], "start": 1634318288, "end": 1635631238, "snapshot": "13423785", "state": "closed", "author": "0xA778be343C1Ee2D358a0f7a0C923C53d79277F3c", "space": {"id": "primexyz.eth", "name": "PrimeDAO"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x891a2e375731e562b4168f93cbac64c1202aa583074d4ce267effa0cba37d823", "voter": "0x033CFeF803852271Fd49d5aD9A051EF5d979EC70", "created": 1635511845, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "primexyz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQR38YA9jEKzBMck9xSNWPFei9deBjtia5sL2EUQGesr7", "voter": "0x04d63662227e4742236A46399d005f988e0883Cf", "created": 1634467951, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "primexyz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZyp6sce1vuRNd9nYu3AkH6GEJ8cCJMitg8Xd3f8H28tV", "voter": "0xEFC34498fa7825aEE43B495e44646e3710b19ad5", "created": 1634461909, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "primexyz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdKogjqLoqC9MouNK1cWEjDhfSU4JCa75pwrJosgirLo3", "voter": "0x22bb05438ae1E34A87e08cE9794C7BCb3E363BF0", "created": 1634409999, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "primexyz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWSEjp14noamaMvb59f1jWQUC5iCyocebX3Yqg3QiJDGY", "voter": "0x53428BecB185232d7E1fc38520847C1F3F5835b6", "created": 1634366323, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "primexyz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW1UWYo6hCYLsvGSwe7mnd3CCPZoZwMHpzkKQwTycU5Ag", "voter": "0xA778be343C1Ee2D358a0f7a0C923C53d79277F3c", "created": 1634318632, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "primexyz.eth"}}]}
