I'm Bert on Telegram. I'm an active mod in different tg's going from 2k members to about 500. I've modded many of projects, as i am BEESWAP right now, and TradingBenjamins.\nI'm a direct, and strict yet fair mod i'd say.\nI love the project itself, and would be honored to make sure it's growth is pursued actively.\n\nMYRTEAN:\nI\u2019m Myrtean on telegram. I really enjoy getting involved in the projects I have faith in, being an active member and having a good time. \nA great community is vital in a project and this seems to be fun as hell and it spreads positive vibes (we already have a captain and fagolosi power). \nI have no experience as an official mod but I always try to help newbies and solve doubts, and as I\u2019ve said before, I have being in several loyalist programs. I\u2019d love being part of this exciting project, as we are all, seeing how evolves step by step.\n\nCRYPTO JOHN:\nI am a community manager I can help and develop project both locally and globally and I am always active to help grow the project together to the moon!", "choices": ["BERT", "MYRTEAN", "CRYPTO JOHN"], "start": 1616414400, "end": 1616760000, "snapshot": "12091550", "state": "closed", "author": "0xFC72b32F2f7caFCa4d5d99c031f4B8F9579c18b6", "space": {"id": "defiville.eth", "name": "Defiville"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmf59EP1pd7CCE7PD1UmDKB1HXET8zv1U933i4zyv8hNH7", "voter": "0xdf3a18f2421889C8fFa98aB0aCFF90E2c80789D3", "created": 1616728264, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "defiville.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZVnUKY1wofjHjm9WvP45cv9wJrPsR2Pqv63L1EPPJHv9", "voter": "0x1c1D8EE11b6538bc7be4dCBa00fac7243CbeA75c", "created": 1616696057, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "defiville.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTnJx5PrjqagzXY9i1sq49u9fNJgy5xZjJL1Jx6nn83b7", "voter": "0x80ef9d319FB09b83a30b13900Bc0A71FD7D3344b", "created": 1616688869, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "defiville.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS6PcFWiLwoSNgGcBkrZemKqgZ83frWfHbv1SdvdLseCc", "voter": "0xb353268ce17d2c7F0f4F8aFF152E548c43633dF5", "created": 1616685186, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "defiville.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPHwY95RFk6Z578kBNNthiDNagRK62TH98w55DxMDPtCx", "voter": "0xfe590be2546f9d7b9bEc7bCb63651D45A007AAc3", "created": 1616518113, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "defiville.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS4PMkg3NNAa7hsQg7z2m4mQdPLZbNZdYnjUStf1qLrAZ", "voter": "0x808E50c4a28EF51778eE1feef231d9afF90458B2", "created": 1616514378, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "defiville.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSqSDwYQ6gWKNsgdPaGWkXxEf72g45VGWACDZr845R7v5", "voter": "0xd48D8cef2F1A7b29BAFb5E17e8B88bfEBaeC602a", "created": 1616513360, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "defiville.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXwrv8iuLVWp2Zz5THWKS1fsB6tk2E8a5J1rLn8uoWwtF", "voter": "0x3fcd5348C95bC8072D396C747436d859FD998c3B", "created": 1616506668, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "defiville.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaTCDeWBCDVfM5LKKex6JXYVUihAmnwTUCGHCGM1oa86B", "voter": "0x87784F991C0c26F098217D9dEf9bD5F4B52373dB", "created": 1616496456, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "defiville.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWuRmYSt7fXHNcATTpyZxTcfkmoHCwUQ8y1KR7Er1w8qK", "voter": "0xc90d49A39b2097B0467781d7b816858aBeC34CA1", "created": 1616473358, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "defiville.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPwSVToWyBnwdmFJoLtrmBDLucyxvKiSKXLeXSdcywUJ2", "voter": "0x2B9f4548d9609de314708BCe516396e77dB24d56", "created": 1616459021, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "defiville.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSoQXRHva3MNK4KTj5KJ1JNiqtx4F2K5efXAi1edvtx2f", "voter": "0x7dB5d398d3E9b1D0B1d119E53Af3E03164637eD5", "created": 1616457493, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "defiville.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ5DzKgus2Yx3hXW1A2nHpNoPTWbvVAUaxvAWYRoFG8HG", "voter": "0x0322A7B5dB7957Ba1be8A500dc49fe69598dda34", "created": 1616456973, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "defiville.eth"}}]}
