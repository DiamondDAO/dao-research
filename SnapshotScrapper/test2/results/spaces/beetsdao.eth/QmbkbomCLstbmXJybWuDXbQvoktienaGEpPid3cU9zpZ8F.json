As early investors, we\u2019ll have first access to the PRIME governance token and will have a seat at the table to help shape the future of D2D (DAO 2 DAO) collaboration, primitives and tooling.\n\nI propose we allocate between 7 and 24 ETH for this investment. My preference is somewhere between 10 and 20. The seed round is capped at $2M of which they have already raised $1.925M. Thus, we can close out the round with an investment of 25 ETH (~$75k) granting us 375,000 PRIME tokens. The minimum investment that they are accepting is $20,000 (~6.5 ETH) which would grant us 100,000 PRIME tokens.\n\nWe would be one of three DAOs participating in this funding round. PRIME wants us to be active collaborators and not just investors. In our most recent call, Luuk noted that if we were to invest, say, 75k, they\u2019d want to set aside a significant portion of that for a joint venture of with us. Thus, the investment would drive value back to our community and support our forthcoming projects directly.\n\nView the pitch deck here: https://pitch.prime.xyz 1\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFrom Luuk at PrimeDAO:\n\nPrimeDAO is a collective of DeFi builders and DAO veterans attempting to turn DeFi into a (more) positive-sum game by building DAO 2 DAO innovation. We believe that buildings tools that allow DAO to coordinate together will lead to costs savings and quality improvements.\n\nWe\u2019re currently working on 4 products that will be combined in one service offering - with the aim to become a financial hub for DAOs. The current products are Prime Launch (Decentralized Launchpad experience built on Balancer V2.0), Prime Pools (DAO governed liquidity pools and indexes), Prime Rating (a permission-less research and rating system) and Prime Deals (DAO 2 DAO agreements focused first on Token Swaps and Joint Ventures).\n\nWe would love to welcome BeetsDAO as a stakeholder and hope to be able to collectively work on shared projects. We would love to turn this into a mutual relationship, where Beets would participate in the Seed now and right away start a shared project where Prime commits resources (funds and talent). Hopefully our collaboration can tighten up even more and somewhere down the road we can do token swaps and Joint ventures together.", "choices": ["Allocate no funds, sit this out ", "Allocate ~6.5 ETH ($20k)", "Allocate 10 ETH (~$32k)", "Allocate ~16 ETH ($50k)", "Allocate ~25 ETH ($75k)"], "start": 1629986400, "end": 1630425600, "snapshot": "13101602", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7761CA398E836534bEd3B8798f96A3CF39D3bD2E", "space": {"id": "beetsdao.eth", "name": "BeetsDAO"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUcX1ywBGyyDiUneTfusir771GufwvbeskHjJe4nks9wm", "voter": "0x39f6d898288a50FeB8d98CD5a81FF15F6CA28c4f", "created": 1630336794, "choice": [5, 4], "space": {"id": "beetsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeoUeLF3KuREuhXZUeHHLG1AemWGQT5vuQKkP7MB7kh1Z", "voter": "0x7Af7cA67AA827F58e0659C52a641aeE55a43B535", "created": 1630213072, "choice": [3, 4, 5], "space": {"id": "beetsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPzdpt6FNt5umA1PKHPTiKzYqk84BsDavDVuWxnh8gq87", "voter": "0xD1Da04A1025FF528BaeB43f84842c96B5ef0f0F5", "created": 1630187861, "choice": [5], "space": {"id": "beetsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSWzaihZywgiPq35vBU1FJ34tH8hVkr3a5qaau1jKWfq4", "voter": "0x17E68F587C9bb3fEc06AeFc15046D97EC3BD618D", "created": 1630178443, "choice": [5], "space": {"id": "beetsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfGBpbgjx9EF7AjwuGaVBra4xqQKU1PvE6cMzzzmpjb9m", "voter": "0x66c3d1948EdB3ef275DD7b7101788196E22a372D", "created": 1630150661, "choice": [5], "space": {"id": "beetsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfJhQxK834VaHSJF5QXiFNAA4hcnfvJoFJ4WuzoyqGMfH", "voter": "0x974a543278197586C3f11FFd477968E17acd1aC6", "created": 1630120020, "choice": [4], "space": {"id": "beetsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXiJ9hT4jzFxQtWuzC3j7ENmTvQW6eiHEy9bykFQKAYkK", "voter": "0x6Fe3C0a532c044de8b5B268E21C83622Df3f30aD", "created": 1630070288, "choice": [3], "space": {"id": "beetsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVgK4txbhhPKFVcyZXhoN1DZvok6syGrp1Fkd1pge5ZdZ", "voter": "0x539438A890A678dd1D9E7aB92c403C97e787132b", "created": 1630025418, "choice": [3, 4, 2, 5], "space": {"id": "beetsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbKch9sQN6x2pRVCdmTXqqQH3tYD2oPB36Ftzn22rwuFg", "voter": "0x7761CA398E836534bEd3B8798f96A3CF39D3bD2E", "created": 1629989040, "choice": [4, 5, 3, 2], "space": {"id": "beetsdao.eth"}}]}
