No matter whether the miner proposes to sell OMT tokens in the market at any time or chooses to lock in the vault pledge pool, they can continue to receive continuous tokens every day reward.\n\nThis can cause several problems:\n1. OMT mixed currency trading mining has become a cheaper channel for buying coins. There are fewer people in the market who are willing to buy tokens directly, resulting in continuous outflow of buying orders and only a few addresses and official buybacks are supporting the price.\n2. Selling at any time without punishment can still get continuous token rewards. As a result, some miners are withdrawing and selling every day. They don't care what price is more suitable for selling, because some people continue to brush the transaction volume after selling to form compound interest. income. Or miners who have already paid back don't care what price they will sell at later, which will cause continuous sellers in the market to increase their selling pressure.\n3. Loyal fans who actively choose to lock positions and continue to directly purchase OMT tokens in the market become the target of harvest.\n\nIn order to encourage miners to self-lock their positions more actively and stop the phenomenon of \"mining and selling\", the solution we propose is:\nMiners participating in OMT mixed currency mining will cancel their subsequent right to obtain OMT tokens according to a certain percentage as long as they withdraw and sell them. On the contrary, miners who choose to lock their positions will continue to receive continuous token rewards until other income is naturally diluted.\nThis program has the following advantages:\n1. Because the miners who sold the mixed currency mining in advance may even lose money, effectively stopping their selling and forming selling pressure on the market.\n2. Active lock-up will have continuous income, and the withdrawal of coins will stop the profit, so even the miners who have already paid back will still choose to continue to lock-up.\n3. Forming a positive cycle is conducive to the value-added of OMT.\n\nIn order to facilitate implementation, the trigger standard is to withdraw OMT tokens from the pledge pool.\nSet three options below:\n1. Withdrawal and sell will cancel all subsequent mixed currency mining income\n2. Each withdrawal cancels 50% of the profit, and all subsequent returns are canceled twice\n3. 25% of the profit will be cancelled for each withdrawal, and all subsequent gains will be cancelled after four withdrawals.\n4.
