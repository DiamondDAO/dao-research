The 50% of the transaction fee that was originally allocated as team rewards is now used to repurchase OMT from the secondary market to be distributed to token holders in the Vault.\n\nSince its launch, Onion Mixer has attracted a large number of DeFi users by virtue of its excellent coin mixing effect and well-designed tokenomics. At present, Onion Mixer's coin mixing transaction volume on both BSC and PolyGon chains has exceeded $400 million, enabling the best coin mixing effect in the entire blockchain field. At the same time, Onion Mixer is bringing users lucrative investment returns by providing transaction mining and LP mining. \n\nHowever, there are some issues worth attention to. The price of OMT has skyrocketed in the early days when the circulation was very small, which made OMT holders ignore the fact that Onion Mixer is just a fledgling project. Seeing the drop in OMT token price, community users generally attribute it to the high team rewards. They believe that 50% of the transaction fee as team rewards will tempt the team to focus on charging fees from coin mixing while ignoring the OMT price. The fact that only 50% of the transaction fee is used for OMT price, in their views, can not support the OMT value either. \n\nWe understand these concerns and need to make an explanation here. The Onion team attaches great importance to the long-term value of the Onion Mixer protocol. The target users consist of both miners and those who have a real need to mix coins. We think it is unhealthy and anomalous that Onion Mixer reached $400 million transaction volume and saw a sharp rise in OMT price without the participation of users with large coin mixing needs. \n\nTherefore, we are recently contacting a large number of institutional parties with coin mixing needs to help Onion Mixer develop in a healthier manner.  At the same time, in order to allow OMT holders to better enjoy the dividends brought by the development, we have decided to modify the distribution of transaction fee income before the arrival of institutions. The specifics are as follows: \n1. All transaction fee income from coin mixing will be injected into the repurchase fund pool; \n2. The repurchase pool will repurchase OMT on the secondary market in due course; \n3. 50% of OMT in the repurchase pool will be directly burned and the rest 50% will be distributed to users in the Vault according to the share of tokens held; \n\nNote:\n(1) All the above operations will be updated on the official website with the transaction hash that users can check anytime; \n(2) The use of repurchase funds (when to repurchase, how to repurchase, etc.) is under discussion. We will launch a more detailed and rigorous plan to solicit community opinions.
