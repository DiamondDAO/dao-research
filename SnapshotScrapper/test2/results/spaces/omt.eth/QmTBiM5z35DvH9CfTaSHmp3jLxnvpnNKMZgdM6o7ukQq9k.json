Meanwhile, Polygon's active on-chain addresses and daily transaction volume outnumber those on Ethereum, indicating that a large number of users are actively turning to Polygon. It is thus fair to say that Polygon is currently the fastest growing Ethereum scalability solution.\n\nExpected Benefits\nWe therefore recommend that Onion Mixer be deployed on Polygon, through which we can expect the following benefits:\n\nPolygon's rapid growth has attracted a large quantity of capital and users' attention. Deploying Onion Mixer on Polygon can bring new capital and traffic to Onion Mixer.\n\nPolygon seamlessly connects to Ethereum assets but its transaction fee is only 1/1000 of Ethereum. Users can use Onion Mixer for coin mixing or mining on Polygon at a lower cost.\n\nAccording to the tokenomics of Onion Mixer, there will be a new round of transaction mining and liquidity mining after the deployment on Polygon. Both new and existing users of Onion Mixer will have the opportunity to obtain the proceeds of initial mining.\n\nDeploying on Polygon will help Onion Mixer reach more DeFi projects while at the same time facilitate the growth of DeFi Transaction Exchange.\nPolygon is currently one of the three major DeFi ecologies. Joining Polygon will help Onion Mixer realize its vision to build a privacy protection infrastructure for the entire DeFi ecology.\n\nImplementation plan\n1. Contact Polygon for the project deployment\n2. Co-promote with Polygon on the cooperation\n3. Cooperate with Polygon for deployment\n4. Create cross-chain bridge for OMT between Polygon and BSC\n5. Enable transaction mining and liquidity mining\n\nAs part of the expansion, we need our community to decide how much OMT rewards to migrate over to mining on Polygon for both Mix and LP mining. Voters have the options to approve the proposal along with the desired reward migration allocation, or disapprove the proposal", "choices": ["Approve; 30% Reward Migration", "Approve; 40% Reward Migration", "Approve; 50% Reward Migration", "Approve; 60% Reward Migration", "Approve; 70% Reward Migration", "Disapprove"], "start": 1626206400, "end": 1626292800, "snapshot": "9129059", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2b909cA5dD488ccDE6c5e21AfE77A2774B7E2e74", "space": {"id": "omt.eth", "name": "Onion Mixer"}, "votes": 17, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdXgYdK5g7mjEi1TMfT4JVRLa9b6BJYHNWQvpvxjcwADu", "voter": "0x33A96c3adcFE0AE77D3fC79bC087aC3b30125c96", "created": 1626264664, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVJ7X6Soy5Jipkj8tMhY1BdAhgB6eXLVLcN28kRNeUUJv", "voter": "0xa7c69301D0c0b246e0841e4728665f9b496b42A5", "created": 1626260010, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZSkWGvCuWyAc4EHR9648bfLryWfbjhad4ejFEC1EzdNV", "voter": "0x4900E84f23dab5625836c899B7B9942f3CDD6E10", "created": 1626258002, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeU4Xmw5s4w46d2NoWUPCp5LFtwwJk5j6Qntrsu2r37hA", "voter": "0xF6651572a490e5E3b480F4a4d0924e0de0CA8727", "created": 1626255559, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme7J73MLjB1Yc3mhVApMAVJzXZ7Eutu7BmVSADh2n1ZBo", "voter": "0xBeC7e0A69A53750c2B7d19428680aA3208673624", "created": 1626253574, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYJWFGAwd15VbMSN2uA4bL8oDzMVKuQqZuLLSapn5qnnd", "voter": "0xe30c05f5c1d5CB34694CD741f454a8D1E54a422d", "created": 1626244423, "choice": 5, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYpsJuZWgdzYNq97b22w3vtY9P3aNWdpXgZ9RcySjMyMq", "voter": "0x5A31471C8F750B0b57FF582d7a7C25Bc2E2d33FE", "created": 1626243074, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVfG8ovyuZJ77FCYEoZgy67ntQNs8afnFLWkYwL6iGbx2", "voter": "0x6064C8814AB6e7869c153dEba54a7EF8e20efB1C", "created": 1626234240, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbUzUtddLpgwdJVNr8SD5UY4yRHx86LEV47MmUvY1hPEh", "voter": "0x491830a07fB1E9A0AD0594350f4EC40dCA7221C9", "created": 1626234216, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXuxRy4iz7oVVUwsyBJXQw1ZQNgTJjDteu3dFGmf6uY75", "voter": "0xd0bBd18B9D5bd771D42D0B99614d1F7C82d8191E", "created": 1626230562, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVekMuhgkP5pxFBXqXQt9aSvEvfUtbRsQJ8GFPXzixbiY", "voter": "0xA7C44DC35FB28Ba45445eCB9FB5202cE83aA8a6f", "created": 1626230326, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQJ72imMW6CAUdVFV5MdcjjQiGUNi6FmqUdNzEvgnFEDc", "voter": "0x9cbebb638C3539b643EF898e70425eF649E1eD95", "created": 1626230016, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQScHMY3LSc5gTrjLmTHQFdWhyZPPppkjH4Bsgah4yVxU", "voter": "0x63140B98b1D159C552250eC37c10161f69F18612", "created": 1626227609, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbUc6dPgAcNsouDYQH8BxL345WRB5Sf5vsJNKNhdYxHWX", "voter": "0xE424E6dD863019b093a8977EeD89675e9E1584dF", "created": 1626223133, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWenJufzi5ZaN3B138BFhe7V9QuwTnyaiEP8dmhpK82Sy", "voter": "0x4934b9832d6A96A7E260b9498091A5dbff375604", "created": 1626222025, "choice": 5, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaP384wkvLYrG31w8A8h3rhBmECsuQNzAkKnkqiL66A3N", "voter": "0xC8Fe2126428497594aFc8293d55DCEEB4349A5d9", "created": 1626217333, "choice": 5, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPT6f2g2AFkDFi513i32vKvgAJtTiCWF66jxnogoridwF", "voter": "0x0ba7dEFBfF05a785c4DF2dcC0974d3204fA68Fd5", "created": 1626212809, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}]}
