That is, when Onion Mixer's daily transactions fall below a certain daily volume minimum threshold, the historical transaction volume of transaction mining will be cleared, after which all users' transaction share will be re-calculated. This new percentage will be referred to when distributing mining rewards.\n\nProposal Detail\nAs the transaction volume in the Onion Mixer protocol grows, the current calculation method of transaction mining rewards that is based on historical transaction volume puts a higher demand for new users to get the same transaction share when participating in transaction mining; in addition, some users still rely on their previous transaction volume to continue to get rewards after they quit Onion Mixer. These, to some extent, cause unfairness in the current transaction mining distribution scheme.\n\nTo be more specific, this unfair reward method will lead to the following problems.\n\n1. Increasingly high mining costs for new users.\n2. Old users are demotivated to continue participating.\n3. The protocol transaction volume stagnates, which will compromise the privacy effect of coin mixing.\n\nIn order to solve the above problems, it is proposed that the calculation of transaction mining rewards will be adjusted from \"historical-transaction-volume-based\" to \" dynamic-transaction-volume-based\". The specific details are as follows. \n\n1. The calculation of transaction mining rewards will no longer be based on the total historical transaction volume but will be adjusted according to the real-time transaction situation.\n2. When the daily transaction volume in the agreement exceeds threshold volume, each block output reward will be issued normally according to the transaction output ratio.\n3. When the daily transaction volume in the agreement is less than threshold volume, all transaction volume will be cleared, and all users' transaction share will be recalculated for rewards distribution from the next block.\n\nExpected benefits\n1. Improve users' participation enthusiasm, maintain the activity of coin mixing, and guarantee the anonymous effect.\n2. Greatly reduce the participation cost of new users.\n3. The distribution of mining rewards is fairer to bring true value to the loyal users of the Onion Mixer protocol.\n\n", "choices": ["Approve with Threshold of $1M", "Approve with Threshold of $2M", "Approve with Threshold of $3M", "Approve with Threshold of $4M", "Approve with Threshold of $5M", "Disapprove"], "start": 1626206400, "end": 1626292800, "snapshot": "9128690", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2b909cA5dD488ccDE6c5e21AfE77A2774B7E2e74", "space": {"id": "omt.eth", "name": "Onion Mixer"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmS6vpd3fRq8ZB1uiRuVgvw7KtjuKQBo74YJMNpRrxdd8i", "voter": "0xd0bBd18B9D5bd771D42D0B99614d1F7C82d8191E", "created": 1626274903, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTWqqLg63SMZ6GLCBriYLRNDbGrarWdsox2YJNByqDvty", "voter": "0x33A96c3adcFE0AE77D3fC79bC087aC3b30125c96", "created": 1626265174, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWMbpJQ6hw3dzjATTmHVCBLWExh6rNMswN3j1y8kYtaJW", "voter": "0xa7c69301D0c0b246e0841e4728665f9b496b42A5", "created": 1626259765, "choice": 5, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP6erNRywKMQgK1qAJZefGi6bZsq7iHF8vhfxkqNwah3U", "voter": "0x4900E84f23dab5625836c899B7B9942f3CDD6E10", "created": 1626257938, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbNk17PYD7hq6QYkVyEbD1smfau1wh7WFB1Gstnha4KnT", "voter": "0xBeC7e0A69A53750c2B7d19428680aA3208673624", "created": 1626253738, "choice": 5, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPX2BFy2Vy1GwPuynY6wTgYkdCnDtBFEZQKFw1A2H1x3M", "voter": "0xe30c05f5c1d5CB34694CD741f454a8D1E54a422d", "created": 1626244578, "choice": 5, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZqJsjKikK6qxB2dN1pQKQynRFjqLJyXzDjQqvtHjSyLL", "voter": "0x5A31471C8F750B0b57FF582d7a7C25Bc2E2d33FE", "created": 1626243189, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd9HZRqWxbEh8cPthd8AeWDUm6ws7jmaX6g8C7xQvqK5m", "voter": "0x491830a07fB1E9A0AD0594350f4EC40dCA7221C9", "created": 1626235611, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdqGCUUKHsTh8HgBBSbUxWPQ3orjxoDskuWm1t1BS5rov", "voter": "0x6064C8814AB6e7869c153dEba54a7EF8e20efB1C", "created": 1626235597, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcfUTMyfXr2r5fT7FpZ6HaVpZqysErEfwBegPzcAbNnRt", "voter": "0x9cbebb638C3539b643EF898e70425eF649E1eD95", "created": 1626229831, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRMApeETJ2Uf9uGLNS8KzWcG4qndj8MqQgPDzXaSP6suB", "voter": "0x4934b9832d6A96A7E260b9498091A5dbff375604", "created": 1626220949, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdrStGESdmTKKLZPVb3fxebC44pVMgeoqHnsKferPN2hc", "voter": "0xC8Fe2126428497594aFc8293d55DCEEB4349A5d9", "created": 1626216987, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYjxfYsoMQNyiiAR8NGCCfdWcBGYUDYYbabSSeHrQuWBF", "voter": "0x0ba7dEFBfF05a785c4DF2dcC0974d3204fA68Fd5", "created": 1626212844, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "omt.eth"}}]}
