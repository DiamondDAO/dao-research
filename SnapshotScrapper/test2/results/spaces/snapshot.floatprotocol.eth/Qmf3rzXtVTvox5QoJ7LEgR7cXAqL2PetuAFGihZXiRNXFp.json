If you are viewing this via Snapshot, please head over to [Scattershot](https://scattershot.page/). TL;DR You can pick more than one option.\n\n### Background\nPhase 2 begins on Sunday 21st March at 10pm UTC. As a reminder, in Phase 2 of the BANK distribution we will remove all restrictions (whitelist, cap per pool). \n\nThere will be 9 pools. 4 of these pools will be in Phase 2 are BANK-ETH, USDT, USDC, and DAI. We are allowing the community to vote for who they think the other 5 should be. This was been discussed on forum over the last week [here](https://forum.floatprotocol.com/t/fip-02-phase-2-plans/15/103).\n\nThe 5 tokens that receive the most votes will be selected as pools in Phase 2.\n\n### Why Scattershot?\nThe purpose of Scattershot over Snapshot is to to allow proportional voting and a greater degree of choice than a simple 'yes/no'. The various options you can choose are below. Your vote will be allocated based on the weightings you give to each token. \n\nYou do not need to allocate a vote to each token. The voting system works on the basis of relative weighting rather than total number of votes you give. For instance, if you just gave 1 vote to ETH, it would receive 100% of your BANK.", "choices": ["1INCH", "AAVE", "ALCX", "AMPL", "BADGER", "BAL", "BNT", "COMP", "COVER", "CREAM", "CRV", "ETH", "GRT", "LINK", "SNX", "SUSHI", "UNI", "wBTC", "YAM", "YFI"], "start": 1615762800, "end": 1616108400, "snapshot": "12039440", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9BF66b90A7be4Cc0Fbde36A82E6187052BefEF3E", "space": {"id": "snapshot.floatprotocol.eth", "name": "Float Protocol"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
