{"id": "QmYr2pcqPd3se8RyVRdm6VsZPXHcVnRQzEmMadRREtkXGA", "title": "IMPLEMENT: LID Token Burn", "body": "Proposal:\n\nWe propose that 23 million LID from the DAO fund (~29.5 million LID) and 7 million LID from the Staking Contract Fund (~13 million LID) be burned and the remaining ~6 million LID be distributed as staking rewards over the course of 1 year from implementation. The further 95 xETH that can be extracted from the LID-xETH liquidity pool as a consequence of burning the combined 30 million LID will be used to buyback and burn LID at random intervals over the course of 1 month with under 3% price impact per buy. \n\nRationale:\n\nIt has become apparent that it is very unlikely for a large amount of LID in the DAO fund to be needed in the future. The retention of ~6.5 million LID in the DAO fund along with small increases over time resulting from LID sell/unstaking transactions is likely to be sufficient funding to capitalize on random future potential opportunities. This is especially true considering that mobilization of these funds requires selling LID on the market which would limit our willingness to use large amounts of the fund. Finally, given that the LID team has its own funding, the DAO fund is not necessary for such a purpose. Therefore, we can burn a large portion of the DAO fund to both make LID scarcer as well as directly raise the price floor by using the freed xETH to buyback/burn LID. \n\nSimilarly, with respect to the staking contact fund, we are able to provide a ~48% APY boost for 1 year at the current 12.6 million LID staked value even after burning 7 million LID from the fund. This APY coupled with the variable APY from transactions makes LID very competitive. Therefore, by burning 7 million LID we benefit everyone while still specifically benefiting LID stakers to a very respectable degree.\n\nCost:\n\nCosts associated with this change are restricted to the development time to implement it which is already budgeted.\n \nImplementation Time:\n\nIt is estimated to take 3-5 development days over 2 weeks without disrupting current to execute the burns and begin dispersing the staking rewards.\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1615269600, "end": 1615701600, "snapshot": "12002369", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB8aA505F812ab1dE4f67DdFD28cbAccae700ce9a", "space": {"id": "liddao.eth", "name": "Lid Dao"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmU8V6BxEhq78iTeHGXoJa9hZkDY2VBvBmxzV74zYBh7qC", "voter": "0x82Fb3d4b191383bE413dCFfBd1c05f2BB53fF2fA", "created": 1615598357, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY3oT3XbMqcHzWgG6U9UuvXaNzx9dabELTeHmPGKLP8Un", "voter": "0x7298749159862E4F4F6951E03368E15b9151c633", "created": 1615372185, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZyjwMyRzaEE8Jy7jy6np2u7wWWifEQsYeoF7gdpKLEyi", "voter": "0x23C2edBd869ca3455D61519d16bAbc82359F9B8C", "created": 1615326318, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc6SR5oN35pLqnNYBuwFZSboza2EUY1r3vzYuVSPZnWDk", "voter": "0xB8aA505F812ab1dE4f67DdFD28cbAccae700ce9a", "created": 1615301490, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfNzmeoskHsWucPBS8FhNKJUQXFch595LAiwJbxFZNQ9p", "voter": "0x2a77bA365158b9db11119c9f8164788e6dC7679c", "created": 1615293501, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQcAVQvZqkuazBVv54RUCMpDCicmUYDDmLjKzJqvKMwzd", "voter": "0xA1F249e523f3B348e02e6e257399857bb0c5Df1e", "created": 1615284474, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSeejtpidQU279CQMmYKx1W9nY17n6baGbGcpRLKCDZwy", "voter": "0xdf6F262159B0C4942Cf3e1c1686Aecc7fd9c121E", "created": 1615283668, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXShw52CcLhQb14HVjCyjitytdeve8w9QYgMfs12apNQv", "voter": "0x0EdB69f1a0dc26445c5Df95ACcB88F9030A47805", "created": 1615283437, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}]}
