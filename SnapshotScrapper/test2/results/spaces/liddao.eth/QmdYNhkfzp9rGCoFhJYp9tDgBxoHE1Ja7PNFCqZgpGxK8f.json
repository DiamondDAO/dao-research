To develop an arbitrage bot for the LID/xETH ecosystem to drive staking rewards and return value to the LID ecosystem.\n\nRationale:\nWith the advent of LIFTOFF and its underlying technology, we know it is possible to maintain the same level of liquidity with a lower level of ETH using xETH to take the place of ETH that cannot be redeemed due to the constraint of a limited native token supply. Consequently, by shifting the LID/ETH LP to a LID/xETH LP, we can effectively liberate ~310 ETH in value from the LID/ETH LP without actually reducing the amount of liquidity. An additional 50-150 ETH can also be liberated subsequently based on the LID permanently locked in the LID/XXX pools. This liberated ETH can be used to replenish the LID treasury to be used with DAO discretion in subsequent votes as well as for the approved budget. Given the lack of recent presale performance, these funds are also necessary to meet operational costs. \n\nThe development of an arbitrage bot for the new xETH/LID pools is also important to ensure staking rewards are being driven by the LID ecosystem. Furthermore, profits from this bot can be redirected back into the LID ecosystem through LID buybacks/burns.\n\nCost:\nThis change will require that people use Penguinswap (operates using Uniswap pools) to trade LID because it automatically handles the xETH to ETH conversions (like Uniswap with wETH). Trading can still be done directly on Uniswap but the user would need to manually wrap/unwrap the ETH which would have an associated gas fee. \n\nThe shifting of the LID/ETH pool will require 2 days of time from 2 developers which have already been budgeted. \n\nThe development of the arbitrage bot will require 2 days of time from 3 developers which have already been budgeted. \n\nImplementation Time:\nThe changes will be implemented after the completion of the associated development times.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1611340200, "end": 1611599400, "snapshot": "11706798", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB8aA505F812ab1dE4f67DdFD28cbAccae700ce9a", "space": {"id": "liddao.eth", "name": "Lid Dao"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTJrhLLvykbawWAKkpoWKT3sCxKqg9FZdsmp5aC9u9k9R", "voter": "0x2fFB0EF286951E58E392f81e3cBDc769eB3Ea30d", "created": 1611461599, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPKfTPmcR7f989xRLQBfCGSAyxSFwgyenUuWx9uYKAGJd", "voter": "0x08AF2bE6e1E92d6F612106DFfff474BB1B482e79", "created": 1611452780, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUVxKtSxh7eruoDSpwU767BgCwDYKsBmKDpRduEQfFfTL", "voter": "0x3B76339e5a2d9F1335BB0Fd7D7eA47A22a0E2c6E", "created": 1611432433, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUCe8FJDE5aHvwt6kUf9u45PskeZXKRdhxeLM1iXehgEa", "voter": "0xB8aA505F812ab1dE4f67DdFD28cbAccae700ce9a", "created": 1611431239, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdRyRYgJqkw7BWpdhxwRQHdPRo4fGrteHaeDFVBc2u4X7", "voter": "0x2a77bA365158b9db11119c9f8164788e6dC7679c", "created": 1611361336, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}]}
