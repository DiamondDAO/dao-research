At present, lid has no value. In addition to pre-sale, it has no practical significance. People use eth as the payment unit, and the team collects eth as profit. Every link in this process has nothing to do with lid. I think the team and lid project have nothing to do with the current situation The interests of investors are not consistent, because the team can directly earn eth profits without using lid tokens. Each month, 10% of the team token is released, or it can be sold directly in exchange for eth (the team can announce whether the 1.4 million tokens per month are still held or sold) and the 95% profit taken away is also eth. Therefore, I think the current mechanism uses eth as the monetary settlement Unit is not good! It's been six months. It's time to promote the use of lid token as the pre-sale and settlement unit. The advantages are as follows: increase the transaction volume, stimulate the apy and combustion, and the most important thing is to bind the interests of the team and the project together. If the team wants to make more profits, it will be tied together with the investors to promote the currency price, and the lid token gets the most effective value empowerment!\n\nI'm curious that lid, as a project that has been making profits all the time, has been profitable since its inception, but the token price has been in a breaking state. I don't quite understand why a project that has been making profits has always been in a loss and where has the profit gone? Therefore, the conclusion drawn from the current situation is that even if more projects are sold through the lid platform and more profits are made, it has nothing to do with the price of lid token. Because we use eth as income, investors invest in lid, but they can't share the maximum profit. Isn't it a very strange thing? BTC has broken through a new high, but the ratio of lid to eth is still in a breaking state. Although the price rises slightly, the investors exchange the lid with eth, so they still lose money. The team releases 10% of the token every month as wages, but takes 95% of the profits as various budgets. The investor invests 100%, but only gets 5% of the profit for the buyback combustion, which is the 5% of the buyback combustion I think some data should be transparent, such as the financial status of all projects so far, the profit of a single project, the total profit of five months, the expenditure of each expense, and the amount of repurchase fund at present. If the team is really good for the lid project, and you are also optimistic about it, you should not always make eth profits, and do not empower lid. At present, the only way to go for lid is to enter ahead of time (this measure has no great significance) and increase many lid transaction pairs. These measures are superficial and can not change anything. Only with lid as the basic currency unit, pre-sale can be carried out And profit settlement, which is the most fundamental solution.\n\n", "choices": ["YES", "NO"], "start": 1608166800, "end": 1608339600, "snapshot": "11467489", "state": "closed", "author": "0x85355B7efc20a70733cB441172767d138C2f0682", "space": {"id": "liddao.eth", "name": "Lid Dao"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTN2GFTk1Ko3qNrwgGhtBNSKWCmBcpqkaPqg3rnFZRohw", "voter": "0x7b566e6C1B34EA32e54679E016aAA7E32cd1b05e", "created": 1608254337, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU2cBY5DdJoJWV8vnRbjKLrn8zBZDqYgQMfAHajebiRQk", "voter": "0xdf6F262159B0C4942Cf3e1c1686Aecc7fd9c121E", "created": 1608210859, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQZytsy1rU3ekUnffY7UmsEtrA1iyUx36iCSwVCkMQdKw", "voter": "0xD96adb84Abe78aBDa1F07fBD80371ad74Ed1c5E0", "created": 1608204775, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeqHsuGN9hiea5oD5xAU9KjPJJgiAtRqRKo9kwVSZBQ7Y", "voter": "0x7aB7e63a30439A02Aa84e1b544f13F7bC0c898fA", "created": 1608187904, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYJLCaWRGbHV2LeQScC65cDkcEq5ckFcWaa5LhdTthDMe", "voter": "0x2a77bA365158b9db11119c9f8164788e6dC7679c", "created": 1608178349, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcaSpTQkpV34nFeaTr7Tu9RCezNvLLKxMzoBkRBWzKbAf", "voter": "0xB8aA505F812ab1dE4f67DdFD28cbAccae700ce9a", "created": 1608174313, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVA9KypuTe2MnGboUn6E9hkisNK6ovADzUQPHPYuRuFao", "voter": "0x85355B7efc20a70733cB441172767d138C2f0682", "created": 1608170107, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}]}
