{"id": "QmbT2KF29tNxF1aESxCcptvUPrABfYnCytt96B8Hnh6T4d", "title": "IMPLEMENT New Requirements for Valid LID DAO Proposals", "body": "Proposal for establishing valid proposal requirements:\n1) Minimum of 25 000 staked LID \n\n2) Minimum 72hr vote duration\n\n3) Minimum support of 10% of total staked LID and more than 50% in favour (Yes votes) to pass\n\n4) Proposal must be created using the current block number at the time of the votes creation\n\n5) Proposal must indicate one of two types (IMPLEMENT or EXPLORE) at the top. IMPLEMENT proposal votes will decide if a given proposal will be implemented into LID's operation and requires that a business rationale, expected cost, and expected time to implement be given with the proposal. EXPLORE proposal votes will decide if the LID team should invest time in determining the rationale, cost, and implementation time for an idea so that an IMPLEMENT vote can be held.\n\nRationale: \n1) A minimum amount of staked LID helps protect investors from competitors/bad actors spamming the DAO with extraneous votes.\n\n2) A minimum vote duration ensures that LID investors have sufficient time to review a proposal and vote on it.\n\n3) A minimum level of support ensures that a sufficient portion of the LID community is voting on an idea to help prevent passing votes that nobody knows about. Previous votes have had ~3 million LID votes cast and currently, 10% of all staked LID is ~2.5 million which suggests that this level shouldn't be limiting.\n\n4) Creation of proposals using the current block number at the time of vote creation ensures that each investor's number of votes accurately reflects their staked LID (unfortunately staking after a vote is created will not increase your vote share, no way around this with Snapshot)\n\n5) Requiring the IMPLEMENT proposal format (business rationale, expected cost, expected implementation time) helps ensure that a proposal has sufficient information to inform LID investors as to the pros/cons of an idea so that they can make educated votes. The EXPLORE proposal format will enable people to assess community support for an idea so that the necessary information can be gathered on their behalf as it may be difficult to determine cost/time for implementation with some ideas. \n\nCost: \nNo associated costs\n\nImplementation Time: \nImmediately\n\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1608166800, "end": 1608426000, "snapshot": "11460313", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB8aA505F812ab1dE4f67DdFD28cbAccae700ce9a", "space": {"id": "liddao.eth", "name": "Lid Dao"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTy3YkSzYD4k6ZAc9przJp817QYGCgLNuKgQSsKDR3rZC", "voter": "0x3B76339e5a2d9F1335BB0Fd7D7eA47A22a0E2c6E", "created": 1608394152, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZUxEJ8f4CtLnK4q8CtaZEMwp4upYXtdQUpGByEfFwdYw", "voter": "0x50bdA015AE50ebD50CB6d3f7A342630aC5F88c1c", "created": 1608353392, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRbCByuNiBjaeMmg9C1LbbBZrEX4kMZsGpPMT71hLMky8", "voter": "0x690d0DC805728233975Cd6Ca24b382a648da98C3", "created": 1608212777, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXo1hjGEQLVXKwvxpusNZFuJ92TJbrVH13eVt2Jc9jtxm", "voter": "0xdf6F262159B0C4942Cf3e1c1686Aecc7fd9c121E", "created": 1608210888, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYAmrVpPDZ5zdw9VPw5ET3TJSqzK97MiaPM5PxFFzRens", "voter": "0xD96adb84Abe78aBDa1F07fBD80371ad74Ed1c5E0", "created": 1608204951, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbDWdP5KLrVMZBKQBHFVoySz8wWnuURWAX2zy17FwNuac", "voter": "0x7aB7e63a30439A02Aa84e1b544f13F7bC0c898fA", "created": 1608187307, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaU6psz8xcsfancP39tjomAqAgiAoh3jeuTQDiGrBby8B", "voter": "0x2a77bA365158b9db11119c9f8164788e6dC7679c", "created": 1608175454, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWTbwvNp2FEdpTFfRQJkvKf6fwZ6QGWSYZPaN816sJ6pn", "voter": "0xB8aA505F812ab1dE4f67DdFD28cbAccae700ce9a", "created": 1608174448, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbSysjFwWxA7M34khSvLBwes2ckkZGG2tP6zmAjL7uxiR", "voter": "0x85355B7efc20a70733cB441172767d138C2f0682", "created": 1608170138, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "liddao.eth"}}]}
