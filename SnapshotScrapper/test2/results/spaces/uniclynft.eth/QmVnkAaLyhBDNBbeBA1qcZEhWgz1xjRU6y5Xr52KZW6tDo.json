This costs a significant amount of gas.\n\nSolution:\nOverall, this process was great for the first few months, but it is not the most scalable. Other AMMs (such as Sushiswap, Quickswap) with a larger number of incentivized pools seem to have a council that efficiently determines the reward weighting for each pool.\n\nThe council can make the weightings more flexible. This can be quite beneficial. For example:\n1. We could give new pools a discretionary boost period that brings more attention to them. This could spur attention on both the demand (fraction buyers) + supply (fractionalizers).\n2. We can reward those that support the Unicly ecosystem more. For example, those that give rewards to UNIC stakers (on advanced staking) - incentivizing locked UNIC supply, could get a boost.\n3. There will be a need for flexibility with Unicly v2 coming in.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1633640400, "end": 1633795200, "snapshot": "13376659", "state": "closed", "author": "0x92b22149fec19094650f3f99dC141c8f77b03c15", "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth", "name": "Unicly"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdjViU3UvCqtjSEMhHNWL64dHfuJD2mi3zLEMEtzspYKD", "voter": "0x38dAEa6f17E4308b0Da9647dB9ca6D84a3A7E195", "created": 1633712430, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRK4rQCQuABs22SxMFpP2fUmPMkM1Ui33endHsdtx2j2F", "voter": "0x02afdc62F85aF8A49474091Fa0F46451A9ED72aa", "created": 1633643379, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZdNq5EZtM5ZxcL5ePGaffpCth9gvWoeKKLz7xQ47i2Mb", "voter": "0x15441e298a22BA6d4E95B77a3F511e76dbAde87f", "created": 1633643345, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWYzJ3tHc5wA3eHQsmMHAw4d5YjaS1MJrPrbddQsvt3e5", "voter": "0x3855D0368aFeE0873539a3dA4C2F310B3C68F87F", "created": 1633643322, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW76prqV7noBhq1fNV34NsppTD2wWX1oCcKLAQ5YAmdJh", "voter": "0x0203FaA54C57329821aAf4f9027dc7803069CB76", "created": 1633643312, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSxLAwTjDoRix3ULmmEWUx12WhonPm5pFuRpX7CWZDtYC", "voter": "0x3B4e9e284Bf2aD3F614949684439f70D6C1CE652", "created": 1633643275, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT9U1gCBLdJW8t86XGb9pu69aSwKhFS3mjoiG8F8gTKHP", "voter": "0x7417cC585602D8e225B26e395a1eFE40EC4A74A9", "created": 1633643237, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmagQSJbqDwFNdLh2PYwdfmRVuVXGggpNNqVn9uZb2kZpx", "voter": "0x83749810E8f633b0555f16D41bA27224ed8703F9", "created": 1633641928, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbb3Y9Z27qJCYQWh4jLFcc8P1GaDJ5ZSeadW7w8XyqkTg", "voter": "0x2325079108Ce42689af06157854F2F48CB268aBA", "created": 1633641237, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeCeNL4Ety6Zq5MtubE3JRiqDvAEBJ1Ke11NQCe3upBhF", "voter": "0x0672c5B9BDd5b5c4dE0C80a449d2f1b2779455Ce", "created": 1633641205, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNfbLFrMRZQ3gTH1QpEBucvy5vVcaGpn7VaEUWgaT8Ua3", "voter": "0x56b64647B164cAb358263Ac6BE9b418f64ec0709", "created": 1633641067, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}]}
