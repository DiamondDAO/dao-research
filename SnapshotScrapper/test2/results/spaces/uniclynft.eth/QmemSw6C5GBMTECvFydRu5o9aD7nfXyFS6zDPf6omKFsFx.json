{"id": "QmemSw6C5GBMTECvFydRu5o9aD7nfXyFS6zDPf6omKFsFx", "title": "Development Contribution Proposal", "body": "As discussed with the current Unicly dev team, me and my team would official like to join the development efforts around the next big update of the Unicly protocol/platform. We are already UNIC holders and the creators of the collections uPMON and uDOGE. Also, we contributed the smart contract part for an advanced staking feature that will launch soon.\n\nThe following dev packages will be part of our work:\n\n- Finishing the advanced staking\n- Unlock of single NFTs from a collection\n- Contribute to UI changes which make the platform more appealing (e.g. let the user scroll through NFTs fractionalized on Unicly)\n- Create a walk-through process for fractionalization, e.g. let the user decide between single or collection of NFTs\n- Allowing proxy transactions so that creators can still \"work with the NFTs\"\n\nFor our work, we propose a share of 10% of the ecosystem faucet for the next 6 months starting in August already (due to advanced staking being implemented). We also agree on a cliff for received tokens which disallows us to sell them for 3 months.\n\nVote for \"YES\" if you want us to join the team. Vote for \"NO\" if you don't want us to join the team.", "choices": ["YES", "NO"], "start": 1629748800, "end": 1629921600, "snapshot": "13083723", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4baAD838e29aDde3076d64478b408B63d5a53FC1", "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth", "name": "Unicly"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmf8Z97huNYoVpardRpvoRaMMLUos6Xt9VftZHpiUq2VG2", "voter": "0x4A6C915E37941F3Ef68539b9ec4d8aC966aBf82B", "created": 1629791340, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXTxckCEASuYhqLXURtEqfdriJeomRZVfZpGxquohiL8q", "voter": "0x5F956ca9a2eD963Bf955E9e4337E0A4F1d2Dd8e9", "created": 1629769823, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQzyjd4wkE6cq4jf32kA5dK3jbcKvxUTYnHcgpGriqPGk", "voter": "0x0203FaA54C57329821aAf4f9027dc7803069CB76", "created": 1629753701, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaFMyGQvrcoYGHendzce9aUHCaX34mmcPAXhdunQu22Fk", "voter": "0x3855D0368aFeE0873539a3dA4C2F310B3C68F87F", "created": 1629753680, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVyMZzFybSMHdQpqW6UwtS4N3zYqo7t1UUHhwpwvy86qN", "voter": "0x3B4e9e284Bf2aD3F614949684439f70D6C1CE652", "created": 1629753609, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSd3uVr6v6YrR16x4EaC1zJEZd9Nyuejv8eDPGup2ANaU", "voter": "0x9C7B84BE5D69BB41a718A4aF921E44730a277F90", "created": 1629752495, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVjauhuuyYTNaLJ9EEMJUEFPyZkrhw4yzpTEnSsWZnz5F", "voter": "0x6e4D61e25535F6824cEE0401aCBE4818551d4d58", "created": 1629752129, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUnb9hKLijRRkzG1Lowm5hTt3EVg3DSp112PEXVGQUNZA", "voter": "0x1A8a7Ae2508A2623789772E6EEAa084AC406D85f", "created": 1629752069, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYn63k2do5SXjYoRVNH4snzaFkMs1tPvTUphbG6mTMysn", "voter": "0x91dC6cb924a68693474a3f5BF1EEDBf1C150B951", "created": 1629750999, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}]}
