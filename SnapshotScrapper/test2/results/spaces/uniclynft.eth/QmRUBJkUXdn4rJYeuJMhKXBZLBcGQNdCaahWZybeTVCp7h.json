In the first phase, Structure users will be able to view and purchase uTokens and UNIC alongside other cryptocurrencies and tokenized stocks.  In the second phase, Structure users will be able to interact more fully with the Unicly protocol via staking/liquidity mining, and will have the ability to create new uToken pools.\n\n### How does Unicly benefit?\nAs a result of the Structure integration, uTokens and the Unicly protocol will gain significant exposure to retail traders and investors.  uTokens will be featured prominently in the fractional NFT section of Structure's asset marketplace. \n\n### How long will it take?\nApproximately 3mo for phase 1.  6mo for phase 2.\n\n### How much do we need?\n2,056.2 xUNIC.  The xUNIC will be locked up for at least 1 year.", "choices": ["Yes, do the integration", "No, don't do the integration"], "start": 1633971600, "end": 1634144400, "snapshot": "13394705", "state": "closed", "author": "0xDE38F015C762d2f8ce3Ba41B3599Ac67Bc2A860c", "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth", "name": "Unicly"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmX8qTpznh3hAQR21jbtZbx2An5g9np9qEtZo9Aa5z15xv", "voter": "0x6771C545E32Dac4B34373c188F39162a380e2F9E", "created": 1634109771, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbyeSwC2TJC8uqVNu9M8Bciv7mWEzMCcmQZ6iZUxHVJzE", "voter": "0x69Fe23743cDCEA95B7643757E2E144C36121d365", "created": 1633983006, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQew4V7d6dwd2v1HxKi4cshaCF7QaKs9PRxW7F7U1PmEp", "voter": "0xDB8eC47F52e2602C92Ac603079d9e7E90D3187Cb", "created": 1633974502, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT7iAjykYvDkNQMZVxrqH9mZJXmi4Ez4zSw82BNvR8cwG", "voter": "0x3855D0368aFeE0873539a3dA4C2F310B3C68F87F", "created": 1633974489, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "uniclynft.eth"}}]}
