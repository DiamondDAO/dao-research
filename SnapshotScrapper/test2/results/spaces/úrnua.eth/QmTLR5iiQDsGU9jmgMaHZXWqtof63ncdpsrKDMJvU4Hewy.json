{"id": "QmTLR5iiQDsGU9jmgMaHZXWqtof63ncdpsrKDMJvU4Hewy", "title": "Vote for Future of Lition Project", "body": "Two proposals were finalised by tomochain for the voting process.\n1) Flow\n(name to be changed due to an existing project with same name)\nOur Team has 3 use cases for the chain. The continued development of the energy use case. We also have a strong use case in the realm of supplychain management. Our third use case falls into the realm of Defi, the launch of a digitil Credit Union.\n Our fundamental guarantee will be that all token holders will be able to swap 1 for 1 with a new rebranded token model. \nWe will retain community support and involvement where possible. We propose bringing the project to Avalanche as they have a network that overcomes the limitations being faced by Ethereum of late. \nThe German state has announced that it will fund a block-chain development centre with focus on the energy sector. We aim to be involved with this project as well as seeking funding from other sources such as grants and investment. The Defi and supply chain management aspects will serve as other means of creating value for token holders and revenue for the project. While incorporating other use cases to the project is a part of the best path forward sustainable energy provision is a huge area of upcoming growth and we wish to continue a road map that follows that direction. \n\n2) Defico We are creating a new type of DeFi / NFT, when it will be possible to mortgage not only cryptocurrency secured by another cryptocurrency, but also to put encrypted entities of the real world as collateral for received loans.\nWe will provide loans, incl. on the security of energy and other contracts, the validator, securing and subsequently ensuring that the contracts are valid. The validation will be performed through the German GmbH company for start and after by and over the world companies.\nThe new Defi ecosystem will have new token, the starting price of the DeFiCo token trading is planned from $ 1, with the prospect of growth as the project scales, given the multi-billion dollar prospects and lack of competition in this new industry.\nThe Lition tokens will be exchanged for new Defico token 1:1.\n3) Having listened to feedback from the community and taken into consideration the current position of the team we propose to go forward with the Flow proposal and combine our resources with those offered by Evgeny. This would divide the work load and create a faster path to the new project Launch.\n", "choices": ["Flow", "Defico", "Flow leading with Evgeny on team"], "start": 1618848000, "end": 1619020800, "snapshot": "12270900", "state": "closed", "author": "0x73Aa03c039eB42564ec3e624E232Ad03CB31EE87", "space": {"id": "\u00farnua.eth", "name": "Lition Urnua"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmfJftnkNjMp2N2JsEHK4N52c9tXaisRv4Tir497xXr1cc", "voter": "0xd876A8DE5554175260386a3e434103DbDbaa28ee", "created": 1618946714, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "\u00farnua.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcCp7nbN3rxCLUgjaiT448WFYqhjXdw3Y6AbkAC1L2ANS", "voter": "0xF365508211310c692769E52f7379F9aA406BD3F1", "created": 1618912899, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "\u00farnua.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPJ84WvQFcx2gHUtAsaKQ3m4i6Y92HYwLkFKfsbNLJLxL", "voter": "0xEd3F76972De08449ec3aF3e9D299b65D5213441C", "created": 1618902269, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "\u00farnua.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRm1TFLpPn2mTTV6p6MwwVGYZdiULxojYopFPkp7p4UEh", "voter": "0xB1E9714dad9E7B1AE9134686200E8775534AbFa6", "created": 1618896217, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "\u00farnua.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbsFQhsEpRjxTxBhoNGj8pqtoYZo21J9Z5AjjwCQNG7VS", "voter": "0xB733d8C091b86a0A13922170838EC27D25Fdf632", "created": 1618868811, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "\u00farnua.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP7gHVNNm8hN7A2kHszLyVftzFdMwR83jZpUNUmTwctaK", "voter": "0x7AC0f4f6A12C3272c25264EdbBa8d554DC225b17", "created": 1618860022, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "\u00farnua.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVbi9gNf9K6gYjfSkizq5zeQWUfx916tobYgDwhnPDEcw", "voter": "0x204695b4976847D468F56D241D505A858db24050", "created": 1618859827, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "\u00farnua.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZhBRpRrLhvHzB6J8Bo1UsRhDTbJGZjcNU2D4yR6XY13j", "voter": "0x73Aa03c039eB42564ec3e624E232Ad03CB31EE87", "created": 1618855373, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "\u00farnua.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX28ndVr7M8J5PK3WWTN8YJD8xR4iK5QjWCEJi31iPHAe", "voter": "0x1fA2b0DDe41718e6348E9fBff024C11f6c6D875C", "created": 1618854433, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "\u00farnua.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRzEo8PgqSGVPYNrttxniTPEhCfNTBwPzwGxd5YSC3jsA", "voter": "0x4b094DAFACA6eFb1685aE57EDa2aA21383B5830b", "created": 1618848112, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "\u00farnua.eth"}}]}
