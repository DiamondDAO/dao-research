When someone tries to connect Metamask for the first time and they dont have C-chain setup, their sites asks to do it automaticaly by a popup. We should do the same so new users dont need to set up EWC manually.\n2. When you connect your wallet and you are on other net as ETH or BSC there is a popup offering you to change it automaticaly.\n\nSo two small changes to make Carbonswap easier to use, especially for new users.", "choices": ["Yes, let's make it easy to use", "No, don't be lazy"], "start": 1629626400, "end": 1630404000, "snapshot": "10000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x16D52369B44C6e88b04FA96ec4678fC54529F312", "space": {"id": "carbonswap.eth", "name": "Carbonswap"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
