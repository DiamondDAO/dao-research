The yield of mutant depends on how much of minted mutant is available like now 1000 per block till 100k and post that 100 per block. However, this 100 for now is permanent set if we create a utility we can adjust this minting as per our need. And on usage and adoption of utility of mutant for every transaction, mutants should be rather burned on chain, AKA introducing true burn mechanism.", "choices": ["Yes, this sounds cool", "No, your idea sucks"], "start": 1600948800, "end": 1603540800, "snapshot": "1", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3D23C4d7aC3CB252c5BF23e25852525a2972F5CC", "space": {"id": "ymen", "name": "Y-Men"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
