The ratio could be 1:1 this would expand us to another blockchain and all its tools for further development or use-cases \nfor instance:\nwe could use CashShuffle \nhttps://cashshuffle.com/ \nto anonymize our transactions somewhat \nsending YFFS to other people trough BCH network \nand having them claim it through the 1:1 trade  \nI'm sure there can be more uses any Ideas are welcomed!!!
