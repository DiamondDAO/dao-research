This will be determined by a R.A.C. (Reserve Account Chargeback )  - The lower the price that you sell or transfer at, the more you are chargeddependent on amount you sell. A max charge of 3% and a minimum of .30 dependent on the (all time low) and (all time High) prices. This will apply to a 3% charge chargeback if you sell 100% of your YFFS at the all time high or sell 100% at the all time low.  This will in turn make the value be less volatile and better for long term investors \n\n 100% of charges should be held in a reserve treasury account this can be used to pay for further AUDITS, MARKETING and INVESTMENTS (like purchasing USDT using it to farm UNI for all investors). The total circulating supply is therefore decreasing with every transfer or sell. Only buying YFFS does not charge into R.A.C. and this is the only exception.\n\nReserve Account Chargeback :\n\nMax value =  (3% )\n\nMin value = 0.30 (so 0.30% is reserved regardless of how high X is)\n\nYFFS Supply: 60,000\nexample: \nyou own 10 YFFS\nyou sell 10@$20 (current price is all time low ) =3% chargeback gets charged and sent to reserve chargeback treasury account\n\nyou own 10 YFFS \nyou sell it 5@$120 (which is 50% from all time low and all time high) = 1.5% chargeback gets charged and sent to reserve chargeback treasury account\nif you sell 10@ $245 which was the all time high you also get charged 3% chargeback gets charged and sent to reserve chargeback treasury account\nthis will keep large amounts of YFFS from being dumped into the market \n", "choices": ["YES", "NO", "YES but different charges"], "start": 1602694800, "end": 1603040400, "snapshot": "11036483", "state": "closed", "author": "0xeeFDA9DfaB30370f68B945aca37A8ff7300dd554", "space": {"id": "yffs", "name": "YFFS.FINANCE"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmd6eypR3HTLnMEYrZERN9yuSv7Hu6HqNTMnPYSaM2TML7", "voter": "0x45cb02dF899559438FC4f893C8cC02269CCf0ef9", "created": 1602879556, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "yffs"}}, {"id": "QmQJxNENvG3YNHsFhaZ1NZd579KAFD1JKGXhgZKFTjFybB", "voter": "0x76A22ab1181C32d7fdFB2e18701DA27a5ba917f9", "created": 1602829147, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yffs"}}, {"id": "QmQBY5JwqMJvAKHH1wKbiSphKdJeYmdNuedu65LGxuc38U", "voter": "0xeeFDA9DfaB30370f68B945aca37A8ff7300dd554", "created": 1602751245, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yffs"}}, {"id": "QmeVRNWuJKKLmKpsZ6nSNeA15M28pVTksMMBhjFGNPcKqq", "voter": "0x3F969504BB7311235773d7bb58292675d606805C", "created": 1602707659, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "yffs"}}, {"id": "QmU6QFVbv1MxDJ5wVrzbb5nVG7998GPF7P8VLS74PcGVJr", "voter": "0x11F568fC6aBf2DD2EB272DB2FDC9e12e36611bf7", "created": 1602700005, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "yffs"}}]}
