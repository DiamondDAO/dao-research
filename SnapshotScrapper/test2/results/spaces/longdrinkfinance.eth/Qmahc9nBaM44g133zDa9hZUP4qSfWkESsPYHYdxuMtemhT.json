To this end, we are offering indices that capture different segments & ecosystems. \nOur first index, $BEV, captures the development of the Binance Ecosystem Value development by including the largest BSC-native protocols. We launched Longdrink Finance with this token, at no cost. $BEV helped us gain initial traction and was the first index on BSC.\n\nNow, that our initial launch phase has successfully passed and we are looking to roll out more indices, additional platform functionalities and scaling our protocol, we are proposing the implementation of a mint/burn fee for $BEV.\n\nMint/burn fees are the most common revenue streams for index protocols. They act as the core value capture mechanism for such protocols, allowing them to offer the service of diversification to investors.\n\nMint/burn fees have already been introduced for $L1Q, our Layer-1 Quality index. Now, we propose to implement a 0.75% mint/burn fee for BEV as well. The fee enables us to build solid grounds for sustainable growth of our protocol.\n\nPros:\nGenerate healthy revenue streams to further develop Longdrink Finance, supporting our mission to become the leading index protocol on BSC and beyond.\n\nCons:\nWell, fees - we hope for our products and their ability to make diversified easy to merit a small contribution to the protocol. \n\nTimeline:\n \u2022 August 10th 6:30pm UTC: Proposal live\n \u2022 August 11th 6:30pm UTC: Voting closed & changes queued in Timelock contract\n \u2022 August 12th 6:30pm UTC: Implementation live", "choices": ["For fees on $BEV", "Against fees on $BEV"], "start": 1628620200, "end": 1628706600, "snapshot": "9915460", "state": "closed", "author": "0x33756a0A837Ec2babee7244bb6D5793FD7306818", "space": {"id": "longdrinkfinance.eth", "name": "Longdrink Finance"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmeUf3dQesakuUYujZgzEfNege6ZSirwRXhAYGSdYNwUPZ", "voter": "0x127782BCB83a3EAB181D6953569403630Ae3A9ef", "created": 1628683383, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "longdrinkfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaFHe1ZocpQ5FYAo1CZ8WykmGDAcD9XPyoGNkUm1qAHMM", "voter": "0x882feD5Ae7da6eA8EE19828C0615f064beF2cC50", "created": 1628678850, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "longdrinkfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSGWECy49ZMnm4rkxnYvqJxEYg1e37DR5oosQyhxeBDjg", "voter": "0x91d8d6e0FAC27aAE1A05678eB33d163fC2E7C740", "created": 1628674688, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "longdrinkfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmctNazifM8cA6x3aqVYS5o9VbPbyhotXCtfeNgX2n5Nkk", "voter": "0xaf3D8BDa17Acae1F19973E81b4264506CbF937F3", "created": 1628650255, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "longdrinkfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSYgeXrtYbb9GKXjQMDiy4gm8weeWWFm7FMoJ5pmyzZQZ", "voter": "0xc395FEc6Dfd4d9178e85BF6B58Bc112C4f18B7c2", "created": 1628628683, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "longdrinkfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd7aT4k5N2yYtc8QESf4dyD19Kx3RDZsYLHLQogUkCHkK", "voter": "0x29d038CE3f05cEAa4C83078977e30D571FdD8609", "created": 1628621934, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "longdrinkfinance.eth"}}]}
