With weekly summits, always on hacking, and the best of the best in the industry joining us you\u2019ll be among friends and passionate colleagues excited to build the Future of Finance.\n\nThe plan is for Nexus Mutual to provide sponsorship at the \u2019pillar level\u2019 which will give us access to their developer community, submission of build projects ideas that can benefit our protocol, and brand exposure.\n\nOur estimated budget using community funds for our participation is $28k. This budget figure is derived from sponsorship fees, prize pool, and incidental funds to support the team\u2019s presence at HackMoney including \u201cproducing\u201d a 45s intro to Nexus Mutual video.\n\nUltimately, we believe that the return on investment is worthy for the continued growth of the mutual, to expand our community, as well as to attract new developers to get involved with building on top of Nexus.\n\nIn order to make the deadline for our participation, we will have to shorten our time horizon for forum post and snapshot vote down to 3 days respectively.\n\nForum Post:  https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/nexus-mutual-sponsorship-eth-global-s-hack-money-hackathon/547", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1622228400, "end": 1622487600, "snapshot": "12524301", "state": "closed", "author": "0xac3A50d6A6505957DAdC761F90F1dA04CD9921Ac", "space": {"id": "community.nexusmutual.eth", "name": "Nexus Mutual Community Fund"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZfA3gdU8xqW5SZ6V1wvWQbmamH4pfe8Hk9M6KktF6M3u", "voter": "0x37Fa7c6B28fc5545d9523D6dbb329Be7e1B9e7A0", "created": 1622487105, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "community.nexusmutual.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS7Ep3Wg1WLJHXYoFuDv8u72buj3VG7bV4DjtvooCRKm9", "voter": "0xA4620Fc13546462e817Fa49e44F04330872495a7", "created": 1622473072, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "community.nexusmutual.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcGPsQ7xj4yRJEaMbZpeDgh8JFvTekLPUQW9PtYLtXY1v", "voter": "0x4a9fA34da6d2378c8f3B9F6b83532B169beaEDFc", "created": 1622467323, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "community.nexusmutual.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbz8MT4sbZMQMUwvSKJ3yCaKuwFiDkGc4UE2RefkFrdgM", "voter": "0x9224bbB4E0fBE2f2f8fab55DEbC41Eb21fDfB804", "created": 1622299486, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "community.nexusmutual.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUQn3WfJYRJy5kXtnx9xzuVDzXLAxG4dfLpaSrYtjpXrf", "voter": "0x3EAD00d7E1B95c5E99F287f04c72f62f2CB67c80", "created": 1622252763, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "community.nexusmutual.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZq65GzzC2jqhdmqBCjhsVBF8HHm6uqMEVsTd2cQxRez8", "voter": "0x53e60bb4603950377Ea15b268b5741143369952F", "created": 1622234439, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "community.nexusmutual.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV1ctHWNJ8U3JrqAwBvamZYscHNJuGiEADXYMrLwvffsS", "voter": "0xa50Ec178Bd0B184A890AB6d2e7a757a01Db3a702", "created": 1622231670, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "community.nexusmutual.eth"}}]}
