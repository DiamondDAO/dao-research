With the DEXTF Dapp v2 rollout, there is an opportunity to concentrate rewards towards flagship funds.\n\n**$DEXTF** token holders can influence the decision based on their votes and promote funds of their choice. Initially the team will select a number of funds to be voted and later community members can propose new funds too.\n\n# CHANGE OF DAILY DISTRIBUTION\n\nThis proposal is to request a change in the allocation of the daily distribution based on a voting mechanism to boost the rewards of selected funds that received the most votes by **$DEXTF** token holders.\n\n\nThe current daily distribution is as follows:\n\n* **12k $DEXTF** tokens are distributed to **Investors** proportionally to the investment/total AUM ratio\n* **3.2k $DEXTF** tokens are distributed to **Fund Managers** proportionally to fund AUM/Total AUM ratio\n* **29.6k $DEXTF** tokens are distributed to **Liquidity Pools** (30% to pool2 and 70% across all XTF pools)\n\n# THE PROPOSAL\n\nThe daily token allocation is divided into 2 buckets:\n\n- a) 50% of rewards distributed proportionally to the size of the fund, basically the same mechanism used today (fund AUM/Total AUM).\n- b) 50% of rewards distributed to funds based on the following voting mechanism:\n\t- twice a month (1st and 15th of each month), a selected number of funds compete for the reward boost through **$DEXTF** token holders\u2019 vote. The more votes a fund receives, the higher is the boost (with a cap of x1.5) allocated to it. \n- c) the rewards for the DEXTF/ETH pool remains unchanged to 30% of the daily allocation.\n\nFor example:\n\nTotal number of tokens in circulation eligible for voting 10m and 4 funds are selected for a boost in the next fortnight cycle and the daily drop is 40k.\n\n\n\n| Fund      | AUM | % AUM |VOTES| % VOTES| Rewards (a) |Rewards (b) | Total a+b |Boost|\n| ----------| --- | ------| ----|--------|---------|---------|---------| ---------|\n| XTF2XXXXTF| 265,000| 26.5%| 3.5m|40.0%     |5,300*|7,950**|13,250|150%\n| XTF2YYYBOX| 140,000| 14.0%|1.24m |14.2%    |2,800|2,838|5,638|101%\n| XTF2XXXSAD| 395,000 | 39.5%|4m   |45.8%     |7,900|9,153|17,053|116%\n|XTF2000EXC|200,000|20.0%|0|0|4,000|0|4,000|0\n| TOTAL     | 1,000,000| 100%|8.74m|100%   |20,000|19,941***|39,941 ||\n\n*5,300 = 40,000x50%x26.5%\n\n**7,950 = min between 1.5 x 5,300 and 5,300x(40%/26.5%)\n\n***note that not all 20k tokens have been allocated because XTF2XXXXTF reached a cap of x1.5. Undistributed tokens will be allocated in following months and have a deflationary effect.\n \nIf approved, the change  will apply **effective 1st Aug 2021**.\n\n\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nWe, therefore, ask the community to VOTE this proposal:\n", "choices": ["Yes, I agree with the change", "No, I disagree"], "start": 1626948000, "end": 1627739940, "snapshot": "12872631", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9Eaf0E25Aa660557018847e71ED9cf9C7772cF77", "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth", "name": "DEXTF Governance"}, "votes": 20, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVFEaUf4XSZivZrNG1gtaQepY8Bv828AUSitsDqh1THvk", "voter": "0xc51E4f7AdA44ca984cBBbAF035b8c2f4672B751D", "created": 1627492339, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb5CDoaJwYubkRt7MAPJizeBSRPrQMQTvqEiYokDy2qtN", "voter": "0x1274ABefc061bdFe37FE0cc28b26B7396C08b321", "created": 1627408618, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeYcuAK7PDZa2kxTq5ywmH4gevhwcbwUSQXP9V8gEaSHb", "voter": "0x7082f1F1F06Bb33aA7adE798677C913225507eDE", "created": 1627405445, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaV7Ep2heg6vwX18HEgWXaR5wKWgNwsLVQXbLMJRBDti7", "voter": "0x5a942DDf763ce3DE5d43b35E90E8E77D63BC6a14", "created": 1627294169, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWSepSh7FJGVxVCVshqHPKqzMFpi77VzXkFaXvx4Sr8m3", "voter": "0x1622C8B57A54B0d42d522f98442a775441388526", "created": 1627268665, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNozQh4Q3RAQ6C7RNTxSnWjbFeM9nXE12nP8BuExKF8qi", "voter": "0xc6A3C0ea92F4FD52307dA06ba6986E5Ea2841c81", "created": 1627134196, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcwCnirs1ao6NmmFMnGNwDxAWpymWEkv3oe1caNQz44sw", "voter": "0x68d8e8bd5218b8815137259fA9256418aD7ed78e", "created": 1627134151, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUhED2r2JEnKVp1PVee9vRMwJTGykB48218u2QcaTsGp8", "voter": "0x62eC6B1658f6c7eccFB9f0FdDE012554d553b5b2", "created": 1627134100, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPCCv1ZL7ucPq29LWCY9WSzT5uGRo4ZmZTMzKx1CKU2Vv", "voter": "0xe3266f395c43E05B97C5A28Cfee0741e178a8eDb", "created": 1627134050, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmayUwZHPT4SN1hTzsBuc5gLZWVcoMaHLcCCpm8bGXP1Yf", "voter": "0xD5D0e4B5ADE48cF72Eb0E4a6e08599F8240CDDD6", "created": 1627133980, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbzoMP8c1ruW5H59CbHTb7BB97yCrKyQJDwNQ2Q7Z2K79", "voter": "0x288bFA9c8341B6a43352365a26dD4cE97c132C78", "created": 1627093180, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcNZTwK3AWji9mKiTbNutQB4AsQ8xeLf8u8EqfpSt3ymn", "voter": "0x111bb9FbA18f65BC0f4A7f086abCED3d93F3F272", "created": 1627032506, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbTxkS5Z88tgMt2Q1s1DbxbBpZV49Eaej8jVEthyeZvET", "voter": "0xacE86C6994FA0CD3C2FAE30F3b30C901C1e656A0", "created": 1627032450, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfRtqrEUZXZJ9Vqfc9aEdieF23iYySwo9SPfGzpyPQWTP", "voter": "0x2EabE15DB55b345eD939563c18B824B38D8Bcbd2", "created": 1627028314, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXFWBsE8GyT792qNipYkx5TBbAKQ7PPbkkEqPU7dc2tUT", "voter": "0x8504028514dEb599dFAA165910d1aAF5A399655B", "created": 1627020210, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSip1xKdxiFM2WjQ8a176AnbG534jKnWgCC5norbBM8Ai", "voter": "0x75527f00EC786dCCd6CEa82C9B90C81781C42E92", "created": 1626965508, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYtuYaQHZnq6xWipLXUXJkxG4NfjuvLBDXZNnP7QPbuCG", "voter": "0x90E0760FB22f7f0C8c03a20C1109975F4655151b", "created": 1626959094, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXhUSWUCSeKpzm8EW5ZJ4KUcgcCUZHR2CAqXLoxQHeAJG", "voter": "0x636B00038bE7dEb2c804434A9C3A96E9764C64aE", "created": 1626957102, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYNSJKSz1G59byz5eKfMjeoUqEiFTidGM2Fg8rRYqvbmW", "voter": "0xfdAE5d49f7C14302a7E0C66491AaD31ab5e8B08e", "created": 1626954339, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXbNZE22SYSUWz4Ma2sx8MUyqc4XC9Jc44TE97e8MqgYq", "voter": "0x4254AcE855E28CF4bC8D1A0F516b7b2DE4628f2f", "created": 1626953774, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dextfprotocol.eth"}}]}
