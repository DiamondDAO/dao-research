Previously as advised - my character was broken up into sections to fit the wearable option limitations - lots of extra work has been done on these sections individually on their own rigs and to go back to a complete (merged) version would require a much older version of the character and too much extra work to get the build to its current form. The broken up parts had a lot of refinements done on them\nThe character is a little heavy and will only be in mythic category for a high price\n\nI have done a lot of testing in Decentraland and everything works as it should - 4 are reserved and the owners will agree to not wear the suit more than 1 set per event and never combined with other wearables as they will not fit well and will clash with the style and theme, this theme is part of an even greater story and growing concept I wish to work on for many years into the future, I have pages of concept work and creative writing and sketches and many deep thoughts on the fantasy surrounding this, as well as years of my life in building out these scenes with a backlog of various 3d scenes I have built. I live to build and create\n\nI'm a technical 3D Artist almost 20 years. https://youtu.be/TgXGq\\_8esw0?t=188 my previous handle in Decentraland was \"Mike Dent\" have been building, investing, promoting Decentraland since end 2017 non stop\n\nI work intense and prefer deep quality and passion over fast production/ promotion and fast sales. This is honest work\n\nIt was not meant to be combined with anything else but was only broken into sections as a compromise to work with the wearable tool. The pricing is high and quality is my best to date, I have spent many months intensively working on this master build which has my new branding for my best dark creative work  &ndash; &ldquo;Dark Horse Builds&rdquo; it is my type R badge.\nI request this character to be listed as layer 1 on Ethereum and sold as bundle set only on opensea for Mana on the Ethereum network.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BijrGZiJrIA\nhttps://twitter.com/cybermike4/status/1407497212951662599/photo/1\nhttps://twitter.com/cybermike4/status/1412517950003744770/photo/1\n\n- Yes
