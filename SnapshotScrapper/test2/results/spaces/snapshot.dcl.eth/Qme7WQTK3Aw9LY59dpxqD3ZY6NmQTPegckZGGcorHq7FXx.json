With an increasing number of users, events and buildings, we believe in the future of Decentraland, and we want to push it forward through our expertise. However, as professional architects and urban designers, we found it tough to find a city or district with real Metaverse-style city planning, a friendly traffic system for users, and sufficient motivations to attract visitors and projects. Thus, we are here to bring our solutions, to build a prototype as a future metaverse city that is fancy, walking-friendly and vivid!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x05060Fa97e54a812d1E15cEc6c34e79f74eBD0b3\n\n## Description\n\nA. Usage of Grant: The grant will be used for the development of scenes and experience.\n\nB. The New Babylon City Prototype Size: about 30 parcels (Sponsored by Republic Realm)\n\nFor more information, please visit: https://metalivestudio.com/new-babylon\n\nC. Problem Statement: What are the challenges for Decentraland CIties and Districts?\n\n1.  City Planning is Toooooo Traditional for Metaverse\n\nMost of the city projects in Decentraland are similar to real life, which is extremely &ldquo;wired&ldquo; from our perspectives. On the one hand, most of the current planning practice ideas did not echo the culture of Metaverse. On the other hand, most city planning did not echo metaverse characteristics, including no-gravity, infinity light, and programming integration.\n\n2.  Virtual Cities are Difficult to maintain vitality\n\nThe vitality of the city needs user traffic. And the traffic of the city relies on the projects and activities inside. However, the current activities are too decentralized that make city hard to concentrate their users. It is very easy to see big cities with cool structures but have no constant user.\n\n3.  User-unfriendly in Short Distance travel\n\nTeleport functions make traditional long-distance vehicles meaningless, but people need to walk more enjoyable and efficiently in a short distance. We found out that only less than one per cent of people would use teleport within 8 parcels distance. And there is a lack of infrastructure that enable people to move faster and have more fun.\n\nFor more information, please visit: https://metalivestudio.com/new-babylon\n\nD.
