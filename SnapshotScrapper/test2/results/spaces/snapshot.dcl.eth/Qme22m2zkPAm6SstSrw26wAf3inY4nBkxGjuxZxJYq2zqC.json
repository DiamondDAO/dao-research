I have been moderating it since.\n\nI noticed a one-stop-shop knowledge base was missing, so I took the initiative to learn and create this website to educate myself and everyone else who shared the same questions. Ranging from the explanation of claiming your username, to the world map, to districts, wearables, and even fun things to do in DCL!\n\nAfter getting a vote of confidence from DCL admin, \"Toonpunk\", (who loved the website), here I am! :)\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n2,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x6ae03D1d3A9b161ec264C76AD73999EE25AbEC5a\n\n## Description\n\nSince April, my Decentraland, all-in-one free guide (https://letsdodefi.com/decentraland-guide) has received thousands of views, and has received awesome feedback with requests for me to update it.\n\nI have been fairly busy and haven't updated it in a month or so, and so I figured a financial grant could align me to maintain and moderate this awesome knowledge base.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nI have completed the core of this project already:\n(https://letsdodefi.com/decentraland-guide) , but I plan to add some CSS to polish it up, and then continue to moderate it indefinitely :)\n\nI use Notion hosted on Super, which I pay for myself. And I do the CSS polishing myself during my spare time.\n\nI think updating this resource is crucial to onboarding the masses into our metaverse.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI am a one-man-army here. I am and will be working on this all alone, as I enjoy doing it and learning more about DCL.\n\nI am a DeFi content creator who documents and educates others who are intimidated by the space. I aim to make guides and content that anyone can understand, which casts a wide net to help onboard non-techy people even.\n\nMy YouTube:  https://youtube.com/c/DefiDonut\nMy DeFi education site: https://letsdodefi.com/\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/thekriskay/\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nSince the website is already up and running, I will be responsible for:\n\n*   Updating it with new content as DCL evolves\n*   Add a \"DAO votes\" section that explains new votes that passed.\n*   Polish it a tiny bit with some CSS\n\nI am in the DCL discord and in communication with a few admins.\nI have no problem reporting updates there.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=ed3849d0-d804-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b)**", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1624880100, "end": 1625484900, "snapshot": "12722284", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 14, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmbcaQzdB1SjHoWZzzDWUCUHHxAzkx3SbfTxiNouiEzr2y", "voter": "0xE161CC33f5B430bE52Aa69520D32CD3f39fa2be6", "created": 1625421634, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY7agV1J2v9tJahz3EGuiy4Q1Jpcgenqc3RoVXX1goftf", "voter": "0xB080843ccA4ef6875f93fCAFB061fEAbb8C78c62", "created": 1625238083, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPtV9xtrFsejCmYWwfa7GfRYXAfaAASUKp4bDPNeYVTwD", "voter": "0x4Ac6144e29BdAD84e7671027dA80422BB00787cE", "created": 1625096694, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPFDaonvjF6EjMeMA61am1aDzjUGVzgajtFisZswiZeRN", "voter": "0xe2b6024873d218B2E83B462D3658D8D7C3f55a18", "created": 1625057598, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRtrepqqEA5hrcAtdmkBiVdpRFb6uQFfpYZ5S3boAABKC", "voter": "0xd8913862630Be9aF46D9C9dBeeC23f231Bceff22", "created": 1624997175, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVMyzdgao8ZcEJSjPFcN9f2hqooG3rPmXLVsEBJXYmEPC", "voter": "0xd210DC1dd26751503CbF1B8c9154224707820da8", "created": 1624996322, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUMpjtMPEKHqubFh8YW7QuuvPyTATEcm6ufjTPbDD9JZm", "voter": "0x90c878CE39208E58477EE6BF4ba1c8B24d9b361A", "created": 1624991935, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaEcn9Yp7qpLgoi6kyV8Tad15wHYoeVsZrjFHfFoiy9Pz", "voter": "0xb89439631C7aaE815F927C0Bd0Da5ac9C2BBe933", "created": 1624968871, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPH2JQBu5oxdMR6bwj6AtC3SGDjrp3q1nn38cNPhh5jBS", "voter": "0x5f45f8296BE3f38119D0c56ad339f6BF66154b9b", "created": 1624957067, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSpB3yNX4BSdeaLzDxkNCgVrRbofCxuLoLxmEGYYHSxWc", "voter": "0xaaE9d8bFf1EF3606c51545B953e0137abB7Ce7f3", "created": 1624955302, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRjcupu5zhUkywzHc6iS1jRQ1DJ4inMAQSSpouDkYPZy3", "voter": "0xCC1e0A566dbd10869c071c811aBa436357858f05", "created": 1624919735, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUi5BsWjo7gphiXktnbcFkg6RA2Vt6qWHZJqtsKCxJKCG", "voter": "0x76fb13f00CdbdD5eAC8E2664CF14be791aF87cb0", "created": 1624918175, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQsVFT8rX9Si4QreCr4ahhe26eeCekCJvVKJ1k45eigkw", "voter": "0x750A31fA07184CAf87b6Cce251d2F0D7928BADde", "created": 1624905216, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYnaccR8P6z7g4MWhp2UxPR64Zm2z7Xkd8gLEC6M9u6kR", "voter": "0x3fB38CEe8d0BA7Dcf59403a8C397626dC9c7A13B", "created": 1624895108, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
