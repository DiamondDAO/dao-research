The district wants to serve the community as a platform for gatherings, events, and anything related to the world ofNFT music.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9405cF5BDe70bB78c0dDF1425AEd6A2f110fC733\n\n## Description\n\nWe aim to create a commercial and cultural virtual meeting district within Decentraland, where users can listen, buy and sell NFT music, and interact with other music diggers and creators on the platform.\nOur music district will develop an unified aesthetic and vision that can host different stores, interactive activities and services associated with music in the NFT world. We believe that by offering a diverse line-up of genres we will contribute to a maximum appeal and attraction towards the metaverse.\n\nPlease refer to our presentation for further detail:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1UBD_reYGBLSuWulZbs0JIZSaVlu63BDa/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe are already building the first area of our 34 lands district, however due to the extension of the project and the quality we aim to achieve we need the resources to deliver a workup to our standards.\nThe grant will be used for developing stages 2 and 3 of the district as presented on the attached document. Funds will be invested in architecture, design and 3d modeling.\nPlease feel free to monitor our progress at (40,44)\n\nPlease refer to our presentation for further detail on blue prints, stages and workflow:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1UBD_reYGBLSuWulZbs0JIZSaVlu63BDa/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nUNO+UNO - https://unomasuno.uno/\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe have planned a 3 stages project development:\n\n\\+Over the first month we will use the GRANT funds to build the textures, relief and vegetation of stage 2 and 3 of our district.\n\n\\+We will spend the second month designing and modelling auxiliary buildings and landscaping.\n\n\\+Finally we plan to model and deploy an open air venue during the last month of the project. At this point we will consider as the first stage of the district to be fulfilled.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9fc81d10-02de-11ec-bf2e-8bc0e796957b)**", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1629591540, "end": 1630196340, "snapshot": "13071837", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmc2G7PWSSVGJHkom5aAR7pKYQK7PewGht3hBCADny575S", "voter": "0x500fE6e8209BA6A8fFEbe30fd4CCa369Ce5537aC", "created": 1629929728, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPapGsemBpee7rRehDARv2A6NEcKRuNXBqnSfKMktxQBm", "voter": "0x6A75aC02b0A2F8e016FfDa57611540022e5f1E6D", "created": 1629926556, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWKWneGdvoVBeBgaYVsrDMj2TsCWxNssB6As9n3frotAv", "voter": "0xCF10CD8B5Dc2323B1eb6de6164647756BAd4dE4d", "created": 1629867031, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmULJNXdqHHpDBino4TZGKQ1iSmXo8YCk2cBxU7bMkGcZc", "voter": "0xd5e9eF1CedAd0D135d543D286a2c190B16cBb89E", "created": 1629863839, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdU7cNrmTrBb2RB9mqntQCPSXArwPpxTaLaYaMazZoCrL", "voter": "0x5f45f8296BE3f38119D0c56ad339f6BF66154b9b", "created": 1629853232, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmetFxChuGVYokwimYusgA2apd8VyrGk78Sm4Z4N8HhPJr", "voter": "0xd82d005E8F8D5385dB40BA23884A5c967BB1e8aF", "created": 1629772880, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSswq86XY53mSMWW8VdAecFdaYMB8g9r8UJrEJqyzN4oU", "voter": "0x231557D79f2320a46cC61D97070a7d64664ED2df", "created": 1629737443, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ79zLGvk4kHznoEYm6MCESjFqusjWRYu4aGP31gtD3xh", "voter": "0x183bDB344A07Ee3D27f07AC4799A56E4A2fE5439", "created": 1629704291, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQFH6dTthve8QbGhXNK2qpF3J9Jw92Ld5zxgJKo1f4SvU", "voter": "0xa4244F6711052752E6Bb0271Bf17c756E6598406", "created": 1629677946, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRWSnAmncAjftEmuqWJ6DpTpmuPm3SXsLwi5qW9c1KJHS", "voter": "0xAB64C5E0C0e7c9cB39d92a033391bFc7E592F094", "created": 1629671634, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNxprqHLjNQTt54BxpC7xkm8UK21r1nWmeq9DyzYAs2i7", "voter": "0x8DD060AD7f867ad890490fd87657c1b7e63C622f", "created": 1629667888, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNnCvGyPjvVJTHht77VPvj2iorKZbaqmCde6AUcaySzEM", "voter": "0xcAD1f3de1777b513D88BafB08fC2BEa5EeD98c50", "created": 1629600840, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPmCdZETSZb21M6RRVABQ2ZXz14h7r8EP2QhoKdteQ6gg", "voter": "0x9405cF5BDe70bB78c0dDF1425AEd6A2f110fC733", "created": 1629591838, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
