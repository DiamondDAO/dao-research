As such, I feel we need a person there to help! I have also witnessed appalling behavior over the last few days, I was able to assist folks in all reporting violent racist rhetoric. We do not need folks to spawn in for the first time and see that.\n\nFor this proposal, I believe one week's time would be the best for all parties. We can re-evaluate after that time period. I would assist folks for at least 4 hours a day, every day.\n\nNonFungibleDude\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n325 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x7a5e56c9fb159FE942C724d929016313628e5661\n\n## Description\n\nI am a certified digital marketer, monetized content creator, DCL landowner, and in my past life a tenured sales manager. I'm sure many of you have seen me around and hopefully noticed that I always do my best to be welcoming and assist new folks with any questions (NonFungibleDude). This would be a dream come true for me to have a chance to assist DCL in an official capacity while getting to know the community!\n\nThe idea that you show up and a real person is there to help you will set this experience even further apart from other gaming experiences folks will have had!\n\n\\#LastSliceGang\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAt minimum 28 hours of my time over seven days being helpful and upbeat while making sure everyone has a good first impression of DCL.\n\nI have already spent at least 4 hours in genesis plaza over the last three days helping folks out!\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI will be the only person working on this project. I most likely at least casually know many of you so I can always introduce folks who may need professional assistance to folks who can assist them!\nNonFungibleGuy one page slide-\nfile:///C:/Users/NIck%20work%20rig/Desktop/NFD%20Intro%20Slide.pdf\n\nLinkedIn-\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-knutson/\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOne week while new users are really flowing in. Re-evaluate needs at that time.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\nNonFungibleDude\n\\#slicegang\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8a36d4d0-3adf-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1635749220, "end": 1636354020, "snapshot": "13529714", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTKq1Nj6qQ1xQ3HPFBzRbztDghvWsh3CuUzdHpEkd4DWy", "voter": "0xd5e9eF1CedAd0D135d543D286a2c190B16cBb89E", "created": 1636242128, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZhcKBZq85T2HSC5SdKtWN9Jwh9A67CbkPDhhxk7UZ757", "voter": "0xb4F9E8baa902AcB18C90a792Ac34f00cfA855F21", "created": 1636177743, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYFxzhsurUvX3UBHoVeqsTFiuYBvMyRS9JjmL19pPg37B", "voter": "0x6cAa802c6895ECD31601518C7f6B9eF6f9349238", "created": 1636050049, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb2YJuoKDzKhHRvL2WWxfP7mto5PbpsA3iRQ7quhZV3xh", "voter": "0xCf1e4c0455E69c3A82C2344648bE76C72DBcDa06", "created": 1636034169, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "0x9ebb9a2c6f34a6010243f5ee9521beb54e42093c6d99505e5c3e7ee5e56572b7", "voter": "0x53aA7EC5EC6cC150fe6cdcF0fddEc50e1F4873C6", "created": 1636007346, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV8F2uUenhbkJAb75D72UY1oQhZNYbx6Y3if6sZFNvwSS", "voter": "0xCF10CD8B5Dc2323B1eb6de6164647756BAd4dE4d", "created": 1635891355, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdqLkjSCBNm62tWSzDGjgBiFPH3C7Q5vHH1Rc3DqQcc2n", "voter": "0xBbEEC2733f441b144726F819D4D8DEe82F65b4F2", "created": 1635875943, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWh6xCwD3991rWhpkfd6XUisMuV5BpEB4mA1C7CQwwkit", "voter": "0x76fb13f00CdbdD5eAC8E2664CF14be791aF87cb0", "created": 1635846000, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdKruQ6G9hk48qNpthnf3qUjYym9KJqe81XVVh8ia77R2", "voter": "0x059d0025E4e1Bb1a37F2C922e54b139Bc1231eE0", "created": 1635829046, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfL4ZmE7cMV1bvQDK9XgSPZU4kNxWf4ywPZ6TPytahP6N", "voter": "0x52fa613b2097808E275356c6a174d0b767F8e0C4", "created": 1635815854, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPVvxt5RMa88p7LqJvHJcKbRVd2QtYsngth2gWY8r9X8G", "voter": "0x509CDeBBa232E7B7f603db5C93D1e4f1FeD9c6F8", "created": 1635815342, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQuKVu4sq5cKqDCCau3AkzJHsY4nNfjMCjThHDd7KeTeo", "voter": "0x6A75aC02b0A2F8e016FfDa57611540022e5f1E6D", "created": 1635811173, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNjy9GQtoWCfoUnBqwXv99JDtGs4uU8b9e1g6DXhdifbe", "voter": "0x7AaAaE8cd46aB71E1e5084d55d9C6b3ea4D970a0", "created": 1635810909, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWcgrFpo4e5BT78JBFTzbqPFuBP5cbDpWeYw3FGT8yRqN", "voter": "0x521B0fEf9CDCf250aBaF8e7BC798CBE13fa98692", "created": 1635771596, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "0x51b17a2af9f8d3e4fd05e9c392f87a3ec11cf6be64de10f0cd5ba4d032a52968", "voter": "0x910c60C049d833A7fD2f5bDa310bbEa1c5fA3598", "created": 1635754417, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf3uqQ9FxefuN2udyWnmpS1Z246vFiLqfUTxZR3qEVdrJ", "voter": "0x7a5e56c9fb159FE942C724d929016313628e5661", "created": 1635749246, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
