Is it possible to create NFTs like fireworks that could be utilised at their content to attract more users to that spot? For example, new services can have firework animations coming from there.  Or to make it more amazing, real life footage of fireworks created as an NFT. With a new service you would also expect a crowd around the content. Would it be possible to create, for example, NFTs of crowds? So currently we have nightclubs with DJs doing their most to promote their presence and venue. Would it be possible to have different sized NFTs according to crowd size which can be put at the content to create more awareness, like an advertising ploy\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n1,500 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x23Cf8AB359e16929944F1Aa8De0D3c5dCD3A520e\n\n## Description\n\nContent creators require marketing and advertising techniques to allow users an opportunity of letting them know of their presence. Inserting content in Decentraland and establishing their creations is one thing, but driving a market to it and creating sales is something not touched on. Fireworks for new content that shoots high in the air or crowds gathering around new content as you visibly approach it are a couple of ideas that I believe would work well in driving users to the new and exciting content available in Decentraland. What do you think?\n\n\n## Specification\n\nUsing the entertainment industry as an example from real world to Decentraland, Decentraland is missing the crowds at nightclubs in this instance. Videographers with prior crowd footage in the real world could create NFTs and sell this as crowd advertising, potentially being of interest to content creators wanting to get a bit of attention to what they have created. This type of footage is also harder to obtain and create these days due to covid and makes old footage and real footage some what new and valuable again.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI mention this because it is something I have readily available from one of the best DJs in South-East Asia and is something he would like to contribute to the crypto space, including his entrance in. I also have some fireworks lying around which I think could like nice in the virtual world. BAKOOM!!!\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMilestones and achievements could be documented as my team and I are already in progress with this concept. Creating different sized crowds or being able to select the size to go accordingly with the size of content created is one of the last issues before it could be rolled out.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=33993260-ec0d-11eb-ba81-318d080cd8d0)**", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1627082700, "end": 1627687500, "snapshot": "12885512", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmei5baN1zm55hobWPGE65i9eXzRsoYvqRNGQ78kQWegwd", "voter": "0xA46481E96699aB3852818CAF875408FDfeD273e8", "created": 1627673419, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWFR4G8SCYWToTDYVdjmiCNK5EhDGjVrTzkHMzH5sK4QM", "voter": "0xeFd13F676744a527B1adce0b3c05834a54640ca8", "created": 1627582497, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX1EdC6p7cgo44SfasaMXU97vGe2cVzrBNj4uK7AngRbA", "voter": "0x5F5Ee55a39F31ED067927a3E5D96072277259cf7", "created": 1627505144, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTThdBhCGdbSboStawW4f2VPaLohxzFSbGzC8LMExqEF3", "voter": "0x521B0fEf9CDCf250aBaF8e7BC798CBE13fa98692", "created": 1627290624, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRy2bV5xVfpDeMst6Q9e6QQvaccAP8QAZG6XY1ZdBEAr3", "voter": "0xad763239AD1EF0154a5dAEE677A78fAEf448F8c6", "created": 1627267132, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTzDWACq2RAeHLFPstAGQZ8GNAYX3PiAZwQTZwbghaSCW", "voter": "0x87b895F37A93E76CF1C27ed68B38d77fEE0f7867", "created": 1627219836, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY7UsU4SBihBtdm6RNV7TgX4Bj9Vuk4mgDPbNgRFN2zAY", "voter": "0x91D47EAbba4C61ab419439FD0ef89559e2b339b6", "created": 1627205670, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU17BLWZSXze1rJ6YmqpmGhYmwmSmKEvfkpeDEFXbJj2m", "voter": "0xaeBfd95F6d4DeA633487F4A17f4F866ad6B6AFCE", "created": 1627165785, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQqvJ7nNjUJENkxAhKVyNBEYmAovkshJrbb19gFj8busR", "voter": "0x0a7e606eB21C80C28A005DAeB5f3d99A40d6B154", "created": 1627163073, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX7EtHLbm2PMsCPBfXtLTCgjH8Q62gFbdzfAbKeA8CZ6V", "voter": "0x231557D79f2320a46cC61D97070a7d64664ED2df", "created": 1627143044, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbbKt3b3ZmntbbHkLnQmgs2Kw676bHq6rYamGrcdtoSZs", "voter": "0xAdf19BD8C637B3241E25E0D60FF78f598008ecC0", "created": 1627139039, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX3iVMJ3ZgwrRXircD9CQZj8fwFvrJ8mKePdaXEZrUULG", "voter": "0x47DCBdF671dC8808d1397bDA92B2cAA4a7c4e951", "created": 1627108937, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbtLd6aKMQD7B6i1xLDXc1wbWjEL8AU5PVrfjpLPoU3Gg", "voter": "0x3fB38CEe8d0BA7Dcf59403a8C397626dC9c7A13B", "created": 1627094218, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
