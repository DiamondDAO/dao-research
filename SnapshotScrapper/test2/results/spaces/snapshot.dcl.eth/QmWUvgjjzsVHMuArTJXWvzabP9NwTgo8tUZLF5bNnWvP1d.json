Below outlines how this could work.\n\nThe benefit to Decentraland is that you would be able to sell items directly from Decentraland, without directing users to other external applications. Right now, when you click on an NFT, you get something like this:\n\nLink to Example: https://gov.rarible.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2ff79e50f8b24000e668c1249be70400905a06fd.jpeg\n\nThese NFTs can be purchased on Opensea currently, and it is even possible for parcel owners to monetize on OpenSea referral fees (1%).\n\nUsing the Rarible Protocol, we can do much better. Rarible Protocol is the only open source and community owned NFT exchange protocol.\n\nOther Useful Links:\n\nRarible Snapshot: https://snapshot.org/#/rarible.eth/proposal/QmT5HNVtGhSVvHUaiTVgCeJdmrbByp26skwcjwwexpB5gd\n\nRarible Forum:\nhttps://gov.rarible.com/t/decentraland-rarible-protocol-integration/16599\n\nDecentraland Forum:\nhttps://forum.decentraland.org/t/decentraland-rarible-protocol-integration/1653\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWhat would this look like after integration with the Rarible Protocol?\n\n1.  Items could be purchased directly from within the interface\n2.  A fee could be set within the interface (2.5% for example, which is what Rarible.com has)\n3.  That fee could be directed to Decentraland DAO (it is possible to set this fee upon creation of this integration, OR, we could just set it to zero. Maybe we could have a separate vote to determine what fee to include for Decentraland DAO)\n4.  Fees and Royalties from external platforms (like SuperRare) could be carried over using the protocol\n5.  NFTs from different blockchains could also be displayed (for example, we are integrating with Flow, Polygon, Moonbeam)\n6.  What is even more cool is that the Rarible Protocol has fee splitting. So for example, a parcel owner could display NFTs that he does not even own, and receive a % of fees from that process!\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nIn terms of implementation, HPrivakos has expressed interest in helping with this.\nA portion of the fund will be used for design work or possible support from other devs, which will be handled by HPrivakos.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis is a co-funded grant application between Rarible DAO and Decentraland DAO. This proposal is asking for:\n\nA grant to develop this functionality. Rarible DAO and Decentraland DAO can fund this together, with a 5K contribution from Decentraland DAO (vested over 3 months with a 1 month cliff as per Decentraland Community Grants). Rarible DAO is asked to contribute 7K, with 1/2 paid upfront and 1/2 upon completion.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=691c8e60-f3c8-11eb-ab97-bfa89f33c258)**", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1627932720, "end": 1628537520, "snapshot": "12947830", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 21, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNLpRKfJ422s7r6g4xf8d969Krtd7hdHM1cUFrXFeoAj7", "voter": "0x9Ea4d42603811A05DB609b7094329ec2C179919B", "created": 1628536790, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYXAoFyWSDo6qykVeeFbD8xJJSyYGRyMS2BwWhEh2oEuA", "voter": "0x1E151ECC2201A86Fc02aCB3dF607e9DC6a78a930", "created": 1628536569, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZKqq2MLSohFuP5ox2k9d1LScJAb5RK96TX2ruuzxEM9w", "voter": "0x4fF5Da7e8Cee923653f23161a2525853EcC3c0f8", "created": 1628536514, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPSkLe1Fg5AwHFVe5TW3tGpESfyDySDywWULaXQyeyhFT", "voter": "0x9DB5af355806fdA9f9d67d50A3a8c28d08e9b034", "created": 1628536477, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYnP6tCHWP2HgBvGgVZr14BYyDZTUtPKbDrQAjJVKcys6", "voter": "0x909F12Df377343D0d935500da28530F9876F9F0A", "created": 1628536433, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNU5idzkjhoqUjzu2hwFZV6pzFDd1rfWybLM9P4VPf5e5", "voter": "0xf519172dc3Cc531786DB0Db7292A51A1bCFa7D82", "created": 1628536165, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQtdDTdzm5rjreuSZSwH55z8uvbC5g7tUDa4nb7CC4j6T", "voter": "0x05060Fa97e54a812d1E15cEc6c34e79f74eBD0b3", "created": 1628535883, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXMrWbwmmTUpB1ExieG8rHogtoWGD5KX3KKNYEwPYW8Tn", "voter": "0x05C351382dB8D770207F319D96ac1184c3717edE", "created": 1628535821, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcTppHZjRPhpKJr2yKYshstXu7acDoH1f2bFKgMj9ozbE", "voter": "0xCF10CD8B5Dc2323B1eb6de6164647756BAd4dE4d", "created": 1628535777, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQy3uAJXQeEvQFFV8FF9e29uDSR8Nh6FX611YohEZDkf3", "voter": "0xc1b8662A68F3eb66bC5e5C4DE7C1EF04Dc344d53", "created": 1628533560, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVeDS9V8J4yE3oBps2Yqcxod5EMCpemmvKDQceu2tNGNb", "voter": "0x338AD1918362025F34b3701DaC1E9648E8e8268f", "created": 1628505898, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeHKAW2mWEMiCcktVCXSyPL6db1j4pwCadF72ypoK4dS8", "voter": "0xd210DC1dd26751503CbF1B8c9154224707820da8", "created": 1628505751, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmahEcWSUepDKkc2JXAP4njjidCvYMWUVwDH8gPmMvq6jG", "voter": "0x0f051A642A1c4B2c268C7D6a83186159b149021b", "created": 1628426692, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVZMtetrwt5X5vpBLWbN3JobGTP1the7FmHRiLUE6riBk", "voter": "0x1F149885Bb140F07ff88de2aC4d521bC27964c1b", "created": 1628339555, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcMYxXki4p1RQWWeeSy7X942e2nYzt5sZSWRbqrG7phxe", "voter": "0x8d1bF34397D31903320AC0a8Fee81B3bB7531537", "created": 1628275408, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYsDoaXYdUqYmxwDJun83144quRmqVpE1UsLYpjY6eXvg", "voter": "0xb89439631C7aaE815F927C0Bd0Da5ac9C2BBe933", "created": 1628238067, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP5WqMhYcs4LbKC8DJ12Xt9dQeH6itTmcoQxTWnM1zZZu", "voter": "0x75B07e64161aCE39d6eaB54d25F25410ffd3d458", "created": 1628218498, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdvCj8TnnrjhWCvwCZ9Kq9Cb8D2r2iitzDEu9d8QYripj", "voter": "0x3fB38CEe8d0BA7Dcf59403a8C397626dC9c7A13B", "created": 1628207891, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSftCik1EFLLUnszHpYhD3ZF4zmhYMNX9SX34yzJhrdtb", "voter": "0x521B0fEf9CDCf250aBaF8e7BC798CBE13fa98692", "created": 1628115338, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWrFmarCF7Qz3K2DEhznQAVvsK5YfM1KTS5G4qmMfoCNi", "voter": "0x183bDB344A07Ee3D27f07AC4799A56E4A2fE5439", "created": 1627969850, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVuosAkaouC8MKQgMsf6XXxmwmrXWLbL67tARhsHojQzk", "voter": "0x231557D79f2320a46cC61D97070a7d64664ED2df", "created": 1627939044, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
