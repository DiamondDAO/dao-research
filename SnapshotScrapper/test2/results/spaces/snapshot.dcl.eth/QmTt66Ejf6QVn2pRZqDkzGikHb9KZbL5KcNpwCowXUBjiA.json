Carbon footprint is related i.e to the consumption of fossil fuels, electricity consumption.\n\nGlobal climate crisis is undeniable and alarming. Therefore, sustainability isn\u00b4t a 'nice to have' but a prerequisite for future business success.\n\nWe intend to calculate the carbon footprint of DCL infrastructure for 2021, which would position the DAO as an industry pioneer in terms of sustainability.\n\nOnce the carbon footprint is calculated, we{ll generate a report with the results and an action plan for its users and the company itself, in order to reduce and offset the greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x13DB57D2120dcB15528B4472387c4bf63d370397\n\n## Description\n\nWe want to calculate DCL\u00b4s carbon footprint and to design a detailed action plan to reduce and offset its emissions. It is crucial to measure in order to improve and become a more sustainable and responsible community\n\nThe calculation will be according to ISO 14.064.1:2018 (latest version), a world-renowned standard which details principles and requirements for designing, developing, managing and reporting organization-level GHG inventories.\n\nBenefits of a GHG Inventory:\n\n*   Establish GHG reduction goals and indicators.\n*   Offset emissions.\n*   Improve the image and reputation of the organization and its products or services, demonstrating its commitment to sustainable development and the fight against climate change.\n    \\-Respond to new community and investor demands.\n*   Help community and investors in their decision-making, offering truthful and reliable information, in a market that values companies and sustainable products.\n*   Identify potential economic savings and opportunities for access to new markets.\n*   Improve energy efficiency by reducing operating costs.\n*   Establish sustainability policies in the organization.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOrganization-level Greenhouse Gases Inventory, following the international standard ISO 14.064-1 2018.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n*   Magdalena Chullmir \u2013 Chemical Engineer. Project Leader. Sustainability Specialist.\n\n*   Sebasti\u00e1n Gim\u00e9nez - Industrial Engineer, MBA. Sustainability Specialist.\n\n*   Catalina Biglieri - Lawyer, Master in Environmental Management. Sustainability Specialist.\n\n*   Gimena Grovas \u2013 Lawyer. Specialist in Social Responsibility and Environmental Law. Sustainability Specialist.\n\nThe team forms part of a consulting firm called Urban Elements (https://urbanelements.consulting/) ,  specialized in the design and implementation of sustainable strategies in diverse companies.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n*   1st stage: DIAGNOSIS (1 month)\n\nActivities: Introductory meetings and interviews with operational team, industry research and benchmark, definition of the base year of the inventory, definition of organizational and report boundaries, identification of GHG sources.\nOutcome: Map of GHG emission sources at the organization by categories.\n\n*   2nd stage: INFORMATION GATHERING (1 month)\n\nActivities: Selection of quantification approach, design of data forms and records, activity data collection, research of reliable emission factors and other equivalences needed.\nOutcome: Dashboard with precise data activity and conversion factors gathered and processed. The creation of this dashboard will enable the organization to monitor and control its performance in terms of its carbon footprint.\n\n*   3rd stage: QUANTIFICATION OF GHG EMISSIONS AND REMOVALS (if there are) (1 month)\n\nActivities: Carbon footprint calculation.\nOutcome: Quantification of direct and indirect significant emissions (and removals) at the organization-level, according to the categories established by the ISO standard.\n\n*   4th stage: MITIGATION ACTIVITIES (1 month)\n\nActivities: Analysis of the results and proposal of actions to reduce and offset GHG emissions from the company and the community.\nOutcome: Plan to reduce and offset GHG emissions (goals, deadlines, responsibilities and KPIs) in order to monitor and control the performance of DCL in terms of carbon footprint presented in a report and a Town Hall.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=da28c1f0-3d8d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",
