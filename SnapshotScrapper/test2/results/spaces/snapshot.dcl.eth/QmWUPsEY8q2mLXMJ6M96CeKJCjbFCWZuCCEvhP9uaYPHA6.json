I am seeing them being setup in (2) possible ways:\n\n1.  like a avatar with their own sign-in and settings menu that is linked to a users main account by NFT ownership.\n\n2.  A simple AI animal that is linked to the parcel as a builder item.\n\nThis question is most likely old and has been asked, already.\nThank you in advance for the response...\nSelbyExchange\n\n- Is it possible to have birds or animals in the metaverse?\n- Do we want to be without animals?\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a579d640-e37b-11eb-bb4e-e9e2ebbd7fce)**", "choices": ["Is it possible to have birds or animals in the metaverse?", "Do we want to be without animals?"], "start": 1626140520, "end": 1626745320, "snapshot": "12815955", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qma2aUJFBtL6nA3DXs2TaZMuK8URkRqddA48idBuzg1oZ9", "voter": "0x1F149885Bb140F07ff88de2aC4d521bC27964c1b", "created": 1626536785, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc62ED4iuvS7D9SV3T5Gcykyiznt1R7dUpgnw28ifnWNh", "voter": "0xa8e9da8976b2e80769F9c15C906868c44AE06F09", "created": 1626296965, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTpwagebw4uL2hbAbKb6WGGqRBqwjdSAQg8zMuJzRnUzU", "voter": "0x23c513B61D5Da152355FD8Bb31666b20E90C6b63", "created": 1626280540, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
