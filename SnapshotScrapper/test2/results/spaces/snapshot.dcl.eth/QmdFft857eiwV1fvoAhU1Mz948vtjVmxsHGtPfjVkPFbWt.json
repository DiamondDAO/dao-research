During our meta-delegate meetings, students from around the globe come together to present, discuss, and debate new and existing Decentraland proposals. Afterwards, students from every university in our network get to vote on the proposal, and the BEN meta-delegate casts its official vote in the direction of the majority. This way, BEN can bring representation and engagement from smaller universities who may not have the time, experience, or resources to operate their own delegates.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x66Aa8Bee5366b6b48811AE0Dac9Fe5e1EEfE1621\n\n## Description\n\nBEN has done a lot of collaborations with Decentraland in the past. We\u2019ve hosted several workshops with 50+ attendees in partnership with Decentraland University inside their Crypto College campus, including with Polygon, Gitcoin, and Uniswap. Our leadership team and students also own MANA and LAND that they\u2019ve delegated to BEN for some voting power and for land to build BEN's virtual academic headquarters.\n\nBEN currently runs meta-delegates across Uniswap, Compound, Gitcoin, Ampleforth, and Aave. Through the BEN Decentraland Meta-Delegate, our hope is to engage students and professors from universities all around the world with Decentraland governance.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe started with a discussion group on the BEN Learn for the Decentraland Meta-Delegate. We collected interest from our students across various universities and various countries and hosted some virtual events in Decentraland. We also already hosted our first internal poll for our meta-delegate to get thoughts and consensus from our students on the recent proposal on whether wearables should count for voting power.\n\nOur next steps are to accrue voting power from our students, alumni, and community supporters that own MANA and LAND for the Meta-Delegate. That way, it becomes more attractive for students to participate.\n\nAs an example, we recently were one of the grantees for the Aave Grants DAO as well as receiving 2.5m in UNI voting power to use for our Uniswap meta-delegate per a16z. Since then, BEN\u2019s Uniswap Meta-Delegate has gone on to participate in the currently active Arbitrum deployment proposal. We pushed an internal vote to over 40+ student representatives from various universities across the globe and then cast the official meta-delegate vote in the Uniswap voting portal according to the internal result. This initiative has not only showcased effective decentralized governance execution but also demonstrated how a community that rallies together can have their voice be heard hundredfold.\n\nWe also plan on hosting monthly events and workshops with our students to bring in and educate them about the different projects in the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nWe've currently been running such an event series with all the UGP grantees in the Uniswap ecosystem and have seen much success thus far.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nErick Pinos is the President of the Blockchain Education Network (BEN).
