Let's change the protocol and open new doors.", "body": "> by 0x1e09a216b70d46229f3fe86d3ad2e47ae01f7989 (Tobik)\n\nHello, everyone. Today I want to talk about a thing that is stopping the progress of Decentraland events. This thing is latency on streams.\n\nWhat I mean is that every time someone tries to stream inside a screen there are many seconds between the real world and what the screen shows. Inside DCL, it's usually about 20seconds or more depending on the server and where is the player located.\n\nI have seen that this thing makes events less enjoyable. For example, if there is a streamer and you talk in the chat of DCL, you need to wait a lot until that person responds/interacts with you.\n\nIn this sense, events that depend on streaming are very slow. Most of the players will end up following the stream via Twitch or YouTube (if the event manager is also streaming there) and it kills the experience.\n\nRight now, I want to make new events with cool ideas but those events depend on streaming and it's quite impossible to do it with 20+ seconds of delay (most of the time is 40seconds).\n\nI think this problem exists because of HLS which is the protocol Decentraland uses. From what I have seen, it is good in terms of compatibility but latency sucks. There are other options available such as WebRTC, RTMP and more. I don't know what could work with DCL but I think we need to change this. Streaming is very important and streams make events better and open new doors.\n\nPlease open the forum post that references this proposal so we all have a nice and polite discussion.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nP.S: with better latency, we could make epic streams with games, karaokes and a bunch of stuff! Think it (: !\n\n- Let's change the protocol\n- There is no need to change it\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0627a110-2fd6-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)**", "choices": ["Let's change the protocol", "There is no need to change it", "Invalid question/options"], "start": 1634535660, "end": 1635140460, "snapshot": "13440003", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 20, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmbT3s9v2DGCxRGAbBxpnzMUds1PYEMGj1G6Wx4KJ5ajYH", "voter": "0x47a6503A119880652Fe42C0806c2067d513C8e87", "created": 1635082334, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPXLCvr5t4xtX6mLnQo2wwdzWZ8Hzhd8iHxhoRK9orFYU", "voter": "0x38dAEa6f17E4308b0Da9647dB9ca6D84a3A7E195", "created": 1634899357, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmReuG7v7RsgeJK7RVFBMyLVMPxUqgz4u1oTEYD4G86eQR", "voter": "0xCC1e0A566dbd10869c071c811aBa436357858f05", "created": 1634860258, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd2KEN5439LDVg2Qzx7a5GYoJpCW5ypBphNgJCaLEKaZE", "voter": "0x99C820E11D5ee26a55755f24F7B6cB55ea782136", "created": 1634822686, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmajbRRnuc1xbEtnj21gzkLUYK3fLQpt8zembAzqiKSyt5", "voter": "0x75e1d32289679dfcB2F01fBc0e043B3d7F9Cd443", "created": 1634821971, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWFRHx5o7YYArxiEJPZBo837qooWsuoU7Ue6KHxRL77qW", "voter": "0xf286E07ED6889658A3285C05C4f736963cF41456", "created": 1634726323, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVWTUuqFWzuub2NzU2LGrdJgsawBjT7CE7VZM9pw47wHE", "voter": "0xA46481E96699aB3852818CAF875408FDfeD273e8", "created": 1634716498, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWnpwbL1JXbqXwKJ7o1vhzKeTYTjGUx1fho5XxTADPSdi", "voter": "0xc6654898d96e97199A8d14E534fe92dd6B2674BD", "created": 1634672180, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmST8iDRYqZFtorX6MZpR3nrugCpPFWKgF2KLuJ6KwDCpM", "voter": "0xa4244F6711052752E6Bb0271Bf17c756E6598406", "created": 1634664510, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVi3DCz4awNRpv1GSaFTSV87eg6RnRiAVcWmedBAhFHao", "voter": "0xD1570080bcB784b4F5E378dfd4cDfFDfd6C110f6", "created": 1634652117, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTN3Cmai4BfVVyQucuygBavyLXd9VUc1xN9yow4RXGEHZ", "voter": "0x12EF2cD4231D5CF655a6CDD4Ac1524FFaa439c17", "created": 1634630813, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc6F1LKkcFmBzgS52CyqdcfwSE2bfNQTkqQfS3K3kZ9hp", "voter": "0x4872A7C0CAE3BA97936C12457a11476A2ED7008c", "created": 1634609045, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRpCsbo7azkaWN6WLqbxogFJ5k5kQNKyLKhNK1ZkD3Zcf", "voter": "0x847c8499183055c6e44A7e5697F19089075f1872", "created": 1634609019, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd2eRmG2xfeTpuFX8iA8Ff3B2v5bxtynbZ7Lw8z7gbvFT", "voter": "0xEe4cE5Ca2C2A76d2346bb1B3E98E01B03553d4E5", "created": 1634597844, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNxgfYqyTvGZgGy6Zuck1CKwu1vCYWyNGxH6gLtctRmsR", "voter": "0x13487E294684Af3Da139e8bb47c2E83f8601EE42", "created": 1634572185, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU8eV2csKTac5EsTqSkk6MpUf9R1mYnQS3BMJd8occtLr", "voter": "0xa9e3C35f2C2E0346d8bA8d5b399a3B2B99db3822", "created": 1634572170, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPT7NaE3yzJuMXcVptZ75HdjJoMuDidUeTP3tQa33Gk1V", "voter": "0xC54A6C3778016b06cBD126cCc3B5Bc06c5F666fb", "created": 1634570109, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYguu1GzQxWNNY9yqPVAc6Nhn2RbQ9HANMbq1nddoTKU6", "voter": "0x0928bD64F3c896660c0f32E990bC203cAf360A0A", "created": 1634552032, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRuv2aVo55matgSp18KCRbNtjGep9se2jfSTEu2JfcWkN", "voter": "0x0d3C8541B779e3a8c60Ab722A5ccF69d418Ba6eF", "created": 1634547661, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVeaKdCWYvJs888xnSTnMhZVDvoEenj7eJyWBFkYs9puD", "voter": "0x1e09A216B70d46229F3FE86D3aD2e47ae01f7989", "created": 1634535782, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
