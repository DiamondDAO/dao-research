This would be presented as a fashion show with an after party inside Decentraland with some of europe, usa, hong kong and uks premier DJs.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2fdc5ec86B1744F8884D08FE404AC2F8612d3528\n\n## Description\n\nOur project is looking for funding as an independent real world art brand to be among the first to offer all of our real world pieces as Decentraland wearables. Making it possible to engage with our art in the metaverse and in the real world. We feel this will be a blueprint for the streetwear community bridging their creations to Decentraland. We know that as a  independent designer with conviction we want to spread our vision across every known universe even the parallel. In addition to the wearables and art we will bring the music that is a major cultural part of the brand dna. Having already worked on real world events with artists like Seth Troxler, Martinez Brothers, A$AP Rocky, and some of the best DJs from Berlin to London to Hong Kong and Brazil we see an after party as the best way to bring the vision into the full audio visual experience by recruiting a nice lineup of artists to share a great event with the Decentraland community to celebrate with ALIVE AND MORE\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe wearables will be by the designer and artist behind ALIVE AND MORE Karl Phenom ( http://instagram.com/karlphenom\nHaving the first hand experience in the construction and design of the original real world pieces will make executing the Decentraland wearables with as much authenticity possible a key in the results of the works.\n\nFor the After party event we plan to stream live video of Djs performing from around the world at their respective studios using OBS Studio and RTMP-Server.com as seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBDf-dR7DU\n\nWhile the aim will be to live stream the dj sets we may or may not accept pre-recorded video of the performances and then stream them live at the event for the first time to the community\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nKarl \"Phenom\" Jouanni based in Ibiza, Spain aka the Illustrious one the Art Creative Director, Designer and Founder of ALIVE AND MORE and TEAM RELMS ( https://screenshot-media.com/the-future/fashion/alive-and-more/ )  will head the majority of the wearable designs using Photoshop, Blender, Unity and Maya. This will involve converting the artwork from the real world ALIVE AND MORE pieces to the  Decentraland wearables.  We will recreate each piece to give the community a chance to make their avatars as \"fly\" as possible in ALIVE. You can see here on http://instagram.com/aliveandmore and http://instagram.com/teamrelms the many examples of avatars created with Alive pieces as their skins/clothing.\n\nMehdi Sultani Producer bases in Melbourne Australia will head the logistics and planning for the event. Working alongside the Djs and artists the primary task will be curating the list of djs/artists then setting up/ securing each studio spaces for the performances to live stream record from. Organising scheduling stream times and running this through to the decentraland event space. Our site for this will be here https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-86%2C-93\\&realm=fenrir-amber\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur estimated time line will be to launch the first collection event on September 11th 2021 to coincide with the beginning of FASHION WEEK Spring Summer 22 in NYC . This would give us 1 Month to develop and design the full collection. 1 Month to design and develop our Decentraland showroom experience to unveil the wearables and offer them on the marketplace.  We offer the community to buy/sell/ collect and with some proposed gamified elements we will introduce the opportunity to win the ALIVE wearables.  Following the launch we will then throw the after party event 3 weeks later as a completion to the first Alive Decentraland Fashion week season offering. We will invite the community to enjoy the live music and show off their wearables and how they chose to combine them with their looks and avatars if they did get a chance to grab one. As well this will be another opportunity to buy/sell/ trade Alive wearables. With a successful launch we can be an example the inspires all creatives to bring their real world designs to Decentraland wearables.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=1d5c5260-d813-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b)**", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1624886160, "end": 1625490960, "snapshot": "12722737", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmcfk6KdHnm3P8NU2v6rhiv7GpsiPBB4CKg6pSbgTvurky", "voter": "0x3609cd1dF99274f09D60cDF669E5BF8073FbD94f", "created": 1625267393, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPwKPZ8D19nRftvfNVYTJjmxFryJzv9KEYVDwmfkJrKNt", "voter": "0x521B0fEf9CDCf250aBaF8e7BC798CBE13fa98692", "created": 1625060831, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUf7CXwZtWHpnoVfbidgFt7sDGL4cW2EfwrYcL1xi2Svv", "voter": "0x99Ec37c145060fE7Ee9E346C3d40cB7Fd28ED80F", "created": 1625014669, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWDugAmSfk3poiffxq31UmqNRTMK83wVBLprNti5wquFc", "voter": "0x2e882c468Cc32f8A852A16Bfd610Ee7317ED4534", "created": 1625001009, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVGY3ku3XxBxKUqbTBzuvmynBph68p43bNkcHiLD6QMvZ", "voter": "0xd8913862630Be9aF46D9C9dBeeC23f231Bceff22", "created": 1624997146, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWkgL2BU5B3uZihTpXUJhLiGjixxga9MXCKEsfbAmPb1d", "voter": "0xd210DC1dd26751503CbF1B8c9154224707820da8", "created": 1624996303, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPhtjq246U6Bb76P4djqfV8YmYNN947YeA7sMmXgGcRc5", "voter": "0x5f45f8296BE3f38119D0c56ad339f6BF66154b9b", "created": 1624957046, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXrDA8FoiDKhYv5gbgpU1VGC8zLZqTFMASu6biWTj4FXp", "voter": "0xf297067585790539c2c24d56D8B25AF22d1E118D", "created": 1624927188, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmebMJah9EMrkqvJhxHVfmJPoYxM4TzoKEU3jqvGm7LgHX", "voter": "0x8d1bF34397D31903320AC0a8Fee81B3bB7531537", "created": 1624925523, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTNK9aYmUgg1Vswg3yAhvBzbUU23agtCZFeD1TxfAVryf", "voter": "0x0a7e606eB21C80C28A005DAeB5f3d99A40d6B154", "created": 1624915457, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbSBhGKLqtHaGoh2XX2oFuWPSQT64j9e2WTqfyp8jMkx7", "voter": "0x1F149885Bb140F07ff88de2aC4d521bC27964c1b", "created": 1624909487, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTfHoRk74R63H5F4nxyxb5aG7sVtKT7LTfjpBWAU5cSq1", "voter": "0x3fB38CEe8d0BA7Dcf59403a8C397626dC9c7A13B", "created": 1624894980, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
