I find that there is too much information for only one landing page. I suggest that we update the page to categorize events. For example, say if I wanted to just look for \"Gaming\" events I should be able to click a link and take me to all current and upcoming gaming events. Can do the same for other categories.\n\nCategory suggestions include:\n\n1.  Gaming\n2.  Art Exhibition\n3.  Casino\n4.  Music\n5.  Podcast\n6.  Education\n7.  Town Hall\n8.  NFT\n9.  Religion\n\nThose are a few to start with but can be updated over time.\n\n- Update the DCL Events landing page to better organize things to do\n- Leave the DCL Events landing page the same\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=a91366f0-c49e-11eb-8d39-ebf2dfa350ad)**", "choices": ["Update the DCL Events landing page to better organize things to do", "Leave the DCL Events landing page the same"], "start": 1622747100, "end": 1623351900, "snapshot": "12563298", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
