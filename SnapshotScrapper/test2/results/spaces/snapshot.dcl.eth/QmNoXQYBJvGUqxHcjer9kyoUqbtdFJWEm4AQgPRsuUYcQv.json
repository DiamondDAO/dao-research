These submissions are not to be vetted by the Committee but are instead passed onto the DAO for final approval or rejection. The \"handing off\" process for these submissions still takes effort and time from the Committee members.\n\nIn order to incentivize committee members to do this work, they need to be compensated fairly. Failing to compensate the Curation Committee will result in faster turn-over within the committee, and (likely) a subsequent decrease in the volume and quality of minted wearables.\n\n### Approach\n\nPeople who submit Decentraland wearables for publication must pay a fee of 500 MANA per item in each collection submitted. A portion of these fees needs to be used to compensate the committee.\n\nI suggest that each committee member be compensated at an initial rate of $30 USD per item processed, regardless of whether the item is approved or rejected. These payments can be made in MANA by the DAO Committee on a monthly basis. Retroactive payments should be executed to compensate the committee for work they've done since June 1.\n\nAccording to this query on the Graph, the committee has published 135 separate collections for a total of 299 items since the launch of the Wearables Editor on June 1, 2021 (as of the time of writing on July 15th). This total includes all submissions, including those that are rejected.\n\nWith the publication fee set at 500 MANA per item, the DAO has collected 149,500 MANA between June 1 and July 15.\n\nDuring the previous 45 days, this averages to:\n\n*   1 collection / day / committee member\n*   2.21 items / day / committee member\n\nAt the suggested rate of $30 USD/item/committee member, each member would receive a rough average of $1989 USD / month (based on the previous 45 days worth of data).\n\n### Benefit\n\nBasing compensation on the number of items processed has several benefits:\n\n*   Each month, running a Graph query to calculate the amount of MANA to transfer to the committee members is simple and efficient\n*   The data that each month's compensation is based off is transparent and public for the community\n*   Starting at $30 USD per item leaves room to grow the committee, and increase the number of wearables processed\n\n- Compensate Curators -  30 USD p/item\n- Compensate Curators - Find another rate\n- No compensation for Curators\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a4d9d090-f330-11eb-ab97-bfa89f33c258)**", "choices": ["Compensate Curators -  30 USD p/item", "Compensate Curators - Find another rate", "No compensation for Curators"], "start": 1627867560, "end": 1628472360, "snapshot": "12943063", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 18, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmW2EN5nTXhaWqNMmYzDvnZ62v9Pjd16vUwXxsXXgjYJ8g", "voter": "0x0f051A642A1c4B2c268C7D6a83186159b149021b", "created": 1628426890, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmToSmMoebex9qj3oCxffDpwDKxpLvD8uDtM54CTGUUoDn", "voter": "0x1F149885Bb140F07ff88de2aC4d521bC27964c1b", "created": 1628339897, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW1J1KzKrbc2B8a7ZH3qopYXyPWHfaJ9eaUxLaDjKKcqM", "voter": "0xE58D9940A395D303e691dbe0676710D9C140101A", "created": 1628292989, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme6L4o2XSXj22Sf5MJJ4K6XsNqDqLzn61ovBrKUB8vpGD", "voter": "0xb89439631C7aaE815F927C0Bd0Da5ac9C2BBe933", "created": 1628238104, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXKkaGgjfEwDLKFHEXqxWe9LexUa4jCTjFJLZLxRD7fD4", "voter": "0x521B0fEf9CDCf250aBaF8e7BC798CBE13fa98692", "created": 1628115250, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNtnRe4kVuqVeS4X1c21F5x3GA6os5FHJC9tDL8JxPjZC", "voter": "0xBD3A71192E7bd7EC404C0700d974aBDe5d4e0D81", "created": 1628038627, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNdQ9JYoQoXmAYv6gbjExXXXgEMHC61v5B8a1AhyrWsp4", "voter": "0x3fB38CEe8d0BA7Dcf59403a8C397626dC9c7A13B", "created": 1628030507, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRnPntxXANnifN8fc9ffW8Et54tCiZkdXvfQAp9ChzJ2B", "voter": "0x8DD060AD7f867ad890490fd87657c1b7e63C622f", "created": 1628006703, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUkdDfCg5ESdA1zyvZhb7nhNNntAjHGiUh1hwqfnG1jDJ", "voter": "0x0a7e606eB21C80C28A005DAeB5f3d99A40d6B154", "created": 1628006546, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQA2oUUefegFDrR7RUDKbc178SymYjBxez88LJgQz3Vbm", "voter": "0x66b1488a32E21f2d2757713D16facd9d25Ec977c", "created": 1627997636, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNsUHBfjP8wMwWfgMUPdPhzWEVbjAFvx1L8HXJ2VxvZ4Y", "voter": "0x169BcCC205c868d297c18E9532a09769Df9cAfF5", "created": 1627922214, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSdKNvgPPAvyBuXa1kGM3Sajoo3B8ah1pTi2h8j6MzPdC", "voter": "0x7BC07eB3B7db966e4F6E5d439f8c33afF5f628B3", "created": 1627922107, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaASSb3S36sHgiPs92aAsz44vuNZr4Urc3UpQt2sTqtqi", "voter": "0x23bE90335e79D3245615985d91f69814f98a0faB", "created": 1627903661, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP8ZYjei2b21JqUgFLidTJBNxa1BCSSu5c3csmMZ24DPc", "voter": "0x183bDB344A07Ee3D27f07AC4799A56E4A2fE5439", "created": 1627887815, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmchKLTd43R1dyF3U92zcz72MpFEHAPSWF2EnTurtXF7eW", "voter": "0x4bCfB57149DD1E8eC510bc2CC490bC4C43C7Af8f", "created": 1627874198, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVSikxp2eBbJeBWuXSUGp61CHWULFwLeKn4q1YTkJwHCE", "voter": "0x231557D79f2320a46cC61D97070a7d64664ED2df", "created": 1627873069, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmcd7tBhjdw56f6BY18ikoGPKpHFJfobEvC9d4dg3LWrzG", "voter": "0xA46481E96699aB3852818CAF875408FDfeD273e8", "created": 1627870992, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWgqjUGvV1dZ4uKM1AkUVtEejdwtkQ5DQXLuJCPBrbJcZ", "voter": "0x00d0E85cAd26Ce0F456DB566721346cC4D2fD44C", "created": 1627867592, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
