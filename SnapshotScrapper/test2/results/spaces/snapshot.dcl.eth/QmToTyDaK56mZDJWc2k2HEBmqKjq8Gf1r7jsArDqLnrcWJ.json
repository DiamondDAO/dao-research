We have been documenting and sharing our creative process through making tutorials and videos for over a year. The progress and speed of our community development from a one parcel gallery to a three-land complex art and education estate have delightfully surprised all of us involved! See the first video here https://youtu.be/e5FCb4hYqPg and the most recent here https://youtu.be/7ev7q4qzMp8\n\nOur community includes multi-talented people from around the world who are all about having FUN while contributing their expertise toward developing the exciting possibilities in Decentraland.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x0D9F54bFF55E0B06cF517239543A4113Bd207e6C\n\n## Description\n\nOnboarding to DCL can be a daunting process to many people. Assistance through community is needed because learning and support are required to fully engage in all the delightful, beneficial activities the virtual world provides. Our group is building trust and awareness about Decentraland through social media channels, event promotions, and education. It is our experience that documenting our creative process and making video tutorials is helping to make onboarding easier and build community in DCL.\n\nIn addition to tutorials, we are networking. We have successfully used applications, giveaways and events to reach new artists, collectors, and crypto users who have entered and utilized the benefits of Decentraland.\n\nWe have submissions from 18 countries in our gallery. They are, in order of number of entries: United States, Canada, France, United Kingdom, India, Denmark, Venezuela, Turkey, Lebanon, Japan, Romania, Philippines, Malaysia, Nepal, Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, Italy.\nWe host recurring weekly events in Decentraland, such as Mermaid Tarot Readings and Heros and Dragons game.\nWe have a global music event coming in October \u201821 featuring DJ\u2019s from around the world, NFT and POAP giveaways, and participatory modules.\nWe have events planned with our cryptocurrency partners such as Polygon, Shiba Inu, and BAO.\n\nWe plan to continue our community-building education and entertainment efforts and have reached a point where we must scale our project in order to meet the level of interest. We must improve accessibility in order to create seamless delivery across social channels and within our complex in Decentraland. It is important that all who wish to access these offerings can do so easily and have fun while they do!\n\nWhile we're excited about the pilot results, it is also clear that to offer the content we envision will require a team committed to consistent effort, and more resources. Our goal is to keep growing the Decentraland community through ease of accessibility, education, and fun events. Having a portion of our community building costs reimbursed from the new DAO grant program would enable us to scale our project.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe have created a flowchart to help onboard people, one step at a time, starting with introducing them to Decentraland first. You can see the flowchart here: https://foreverbird.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/screen_shot\\_2021-05-19\\_at\\_2.31.35\\_pm.png\n\nWe are using an app to help get feedback on what is of interest to the greater social media community.
