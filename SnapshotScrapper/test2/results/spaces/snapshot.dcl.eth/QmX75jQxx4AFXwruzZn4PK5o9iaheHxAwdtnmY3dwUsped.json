{"id": "QmX75jQxx4AFXwruzZn4PK5o9iaheHxAwdtnmY3dwUsped", "title": "The in-world DAO governance forum", "body": "> by 0xe6d503b3ab9565560c3a6a6881d79ba29590f99f (Guest-e6d503)\n\nShould the following Tier 2: a one-time payment of $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAn in-world DAO headquarters where users participate in discussions, review proposals, cast votes, and archive past DAO decisions as a constitution. This public forum of governance is open to all members of the community all the time and hosts meetups, roundtables, regular town halls, and other DAO events.\n\nThe headquarters are being built by core contributors to the DAO community with ideas and feedback from many stakeholders in the DAO, Foundation, and creator community.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x17fca813c5d9eEFD6197C00bAF8B464d0f0f403f\n\n## Description\n\nThe Decentraland DAO lives and breathes through discussion, communication, and community building.\n\n1.  KevinOnEarth proved the need and effectiveness of regular town hall discussion events-but we need a more stable and featureful forum to host them.\n\n2.  The DAO Governance Snapshot web interface is great for voting but lacks discussion and commenting. An in-world presentation of the Snapshot space allows users to process and read proposals in the context that the proposals govern, instead of an abstract interface-necessarily a more engaging experience. The Decentraland DAO will be the first DAO to conduct avatar-based 3D governance discussion and voting.\n\n3.  Activity in the #dao channel and #town-hall channels in Decentraland+ discord proves the community need for ad-hoc discussion places.\n\n4.  Finally, out of principle, the DAO must have a presence in the world that it governs.\n\nInitially, the scene will be hosted in a district. In the future, we'll explore proposing the purchase of LAND for DAO-related scenes as the DAO gains power.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Requirements\n\nForum structure\n\n*   Main forum amphitheater\n    *   Podium\n        *   Controls active proposal on display screen with next/last/next 10/last 10 or pick-from-list\n    *   Ascending forum amphitheater rows\n    *   Main display screen showing a proposal\n        *   If proposal is a POI, portal link to POI\n        *   Out-of-scope but noted: if your address has voted on the selected proposal on the display screen, it is reflected around your avatar\n    *   Out-of-scope but noted: displayed proposal title is painted around the forum, on the columns and circumscribing the top of the structure\n    *   Screen streaming from Twitch or Discord\n    *   *   External admin dashboard\n*   Intro hallway\n    *   Book of all active proposals\n    *   Book of all enacted proposals\n    *   Book of all passed polls\n    *   Plaque/book about the purpose of the DAO and this place\n    *   POAP dispenser\n    *   Comments box/large chalice\n        *   Users can submit text comments and topics to be read at upcoming gatherings or during the current gathering\n            *   256 character strings, loaded in a queue, sign to submit\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe DAO hub is being built by many contributors, led by Trevor (previously product @ Decentraland), FrankyNeedles (Franky's Tavern, client builds, @FrankyNeedles), and Lastraum (Last Slice etc., @lastraum), with support from Lastraum/Xeta's dev group and oversight from the Foundation content team.
