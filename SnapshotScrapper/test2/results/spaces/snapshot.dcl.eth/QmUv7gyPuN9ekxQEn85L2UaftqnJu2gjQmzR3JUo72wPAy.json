The [Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/) was formed to help with this process.\n\nThere are currently only three individuals sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.\n\nTo help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.\n\n**The candidate**\n\nAfter the [call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047),  Laura Uson Dolsac was nominated:\n\n\"Laura is a lead artist and wearables designer for Polygonal Mind. With a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts, Laura has been working on video games professionally since 2016. Since Decentralnd's launch in 2020, Laura has helped to build several successful scenes for projects including Momus Park, ABM, and most recently Etheremon and the Wondertech pledge.\n\nWhile working for Polygonal Mind, Laura has built or contributed to many popular wearable collections. Notable examples include the Meme, Moebius, and BAYC collections. Laura is a skilled and thoughtful mentor, and has worked with numerous members of the Decentraland community to help them bring their wearables and creations into the world.\"\n\n**Compensation**\n\nOn August 20th, 2021, the [DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b) to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review.\n\nCommittee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.\n\n**Necessary qualifications**\n\nCuration Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):\n\n*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation\n*   A full understanding of skin weighting\n*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here\n*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline\n*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO\n*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions\n\n**Should  Laura Uson Dolsac be added to the Wearables Curation Committee?**\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7ae38590-1687-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)**", "choices": ["Yes", "No", "Invalid question/options"], "start": 1631753160, "end": 1632357960, "snapshot": "13233607", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 17, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUwDkhvG9LZBL3URv94TNcWyf6L5qmJdQcsE7jFRRoa4C", "voter": "0x5dA5F4c020f856aBdB168fd35c957D6006ba2edE", "created": 1632350434, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUUBqb2x7WWWPPt5jpxBt2xoMDD38FzfY44AEkqpMeBeJ", "voter": "0x45208c10E922D932c0A638e7d8e92307fC73B40b", "created": 1632229583, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcKBDCKk4fwV6KbqqyubxhPjAGszifLpmqRSzuo6wzt4x", "voter": "0x780909C4F1305E5953041E744B09E2F016180676", "created": 1632228843, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZVw1UkucQsqvt93hdjwst1gamKnrKSDuTJ76fVYZnNZF", "voter": "0x7AaAaE8cd46aB71E1e5084d55d9C6b3ea4D970a0", "created": 1632087425, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbj6ikkqFgwBQfqpPbtgbdyrGJhThyfYKPCyq3WZeFiy9", "voter": "0xd5e9eF1CedAd0D135d543D286a2c190B16cBb89E", "created": 1632016526, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWPXGCjW5FgSspdxxJ6n6wEuSqcHXgoZu5jMgzgqtXUrL", "voter": "0x7a7a5fAD8C4107ED0959191e7Ff36Ba82D4ea2F9", "created": 1631954832, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcxkzdSGoo1KuybAz3uwoPWA8B5dh5cuyGQDeGiYXvpTL", "voter": "0x9147dc23a24073b7a4210173383b90e6437c507e", "created": 1631940317, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXzukb8JeJpUSFqLZ6tV2dqqRj4ZwhcTaj2NeGLTJ1Z3z", "voter": "0x521B0fEf9CDCf250aBaF8e7BC798CBE13fa98692", "created": 1631913929, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYZBX9AeTebd3LKRdGuZipCRUano6FRGLX3GnScgghAj9", "voter": "0x0a7e606eB21C80C28A005DAeB5f3d99A40d6B154", "created": 1631910481, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme2QLPZZztU5FTxLsvL1aLDDJvdLZsdRv9bjHteATty7M", "voter": "0xe5F55468585ef91CF1a87aa3aF4c830FA7AE78dE", "created": 1631883221, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcmqBbC4Uea2QgfYWhLF1CTVwmzLVQ7kXDV9fxWi9M1ff", "voter": "0x8Cff6832174091DAe86F0244e3Fd92d4CeD2Fe07", "created": 1631879593, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT1frQapSFMFaGs1gmKzSMGfFmcNfYfD4EWR4f9hGdAXp", "voter": "0x7B041729A60AC903a18a5B1C1328a300C8D539C3", "created": 1631833811, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZy12uSwPiok9Xfw1LCF2PvK713HMUgeheg5exz9esnui", "voter": "0x9982b469910c2Ee2EA566dCfCc250CDD34056397", "created": 1631816346, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVjw4NKMYzgLbKduFgFeHP9eWfYF3fRCpf65Gt981fhv5", "voter": "0x598f8af1565003AE7456DaC280a18ee826Df7a2c", "created": 1631809780, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUa73JmhYstVPd1vgAkdgJuDVy2cgXnfge8tV8NbvJsqD", "voter": "0x9dB59920d3776c2d8A3aA0CbD7b16d81FcAb0A2b", "created": 1631802871, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNdzxVFNbSSW3S7XgPh3HVW2mxPc7yuUu3u3jYQnpAMHF", "voter": "0xe2b6024873d218B2E83B462D3658D8D7C3f55a18", "created": 1631802416, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf4CHMM551RCr8B6f28YLvkpiXZd6aMrn56uFmS6SHRJr", "voter": "0x82d54417FC69681dc74A6C0c68C6DBad5A2857B9", "created": 1631780312, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
