The [Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/) was formed to help with this process.\n\nThere are currently only three individuals sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.\n\nTo help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.\n\n**The candidate**\n\nAfter the [call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047),  Malloy was nominated:\n\n\"Malloy is one half of https://www.feekagames.com/ A professional 3D artist since the age of 18, Malloy originally worked for the HSN US Television shopping channel creating 3D product animations and renders in C4D. After working for 6 months in advertising, Malloy went to university where they received a BA degree in Computer Game Arts.\n\nDuring their time at university, Malloy worked on various titles, and interned for several game studios in the Guildford, UK, area. Examples include Born Ready Games, Edge Case Games, Atom Republic, and Echo Peak. After graduating, Malloy worked for various studios, helping to launch titles for the Xbox One and Playstation 4.\n\nAfter 8 years of working in the gaming industry, Malloy transitioned to full-time independent work alongside a friend from university. Together, they\u2019ve since provided 6 years worth of work to Atom Republic with Atom Universe content, in addition to working with many other indie studios from around the world. They\u2019ve also recently developed their own mobile game \u201cPatty Stack\u2019, which launched in March of 2021.\n\nMalloy discovered Decentraland about 6 months ago shortly before the launch of the L2 wearables editor. Malloy thoroughly enjoys the wearables creation process, and has worked with several parties within Decentraland\u2019s community, including the Foundation, to help provide 3D content.\"\n\n**Compensation**\n\nOn August 20th, 2021, the [DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b) to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review.\n\nCommittee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.\n\n**Necessary qualifications**\n\nCuration Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):\n\n*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation\n*   A full understanding of skin weighting\n*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here\n*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline\n*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO\n*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions\n\n**Should Malloy  be added to the Wearables Curation Committee?**\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on
