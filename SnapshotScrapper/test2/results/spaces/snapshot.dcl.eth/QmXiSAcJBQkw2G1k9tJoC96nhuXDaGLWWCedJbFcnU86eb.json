The idea of the flower shop that is so much more than the ordinary flower store comes from the cult Italian comic book Alan Ford by Bax Munker and Magnus. Flowershop is run by Ultramono, an art laboratory for the production of cybernetic art. Founded by Tanja Vujinovic (www.tanjav.art), new media artist with more than 25 years of experience in production and execution of multimedia events, Flowershop is going to be a new location and  continuation of Ultramono events organized across the Metaverse, that were recently held among other platforms also on VRChat and Sansar. It is envisioned as an online venue for live cyber exhibitions, performances and other events to showcase the work of artists and scientists before an international audience that will innovatively involve blockchain platform to support both community at large and participants. Using poaps, tickets, wearables, works of art, and creating workplaces, Flowershop will expand the ecosystem of the emerging new economy in art production within Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nProject will be executed in stages, first being the actual building of the venue. Models of the building already exist, so this is going to be a process of optimization and adjusting the initial sketch so it can be fully functional on Decentraland platform. After the initial stage of building and setting up the base, we will start with developing individual modules and governance of the Flowershop, and work on a multiyear programme of exhibition, party, and conversations programme, and define curated and conceptualized exhibitions. We plan to have up to ten curated collective and individual exhibition per year, and monthly talks and party events, with spontaneous events as well. We are going to use this grant to hire stuff for curation and organization, get help in building and optimization, promote and network not just on the Internet but also using real life media outlets like for example Flash Art, and try to get in touch with art bloggers. Most important aspect of the whole Part of the grant will be used to get the land for the venue. Flowershop concept is the idea of self sustainability, so extra special attention will be devoted to having help with facilitating the financial management of the space so both the programme will continue and all involved could receive compensation for their contribution to the programme.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nUltramono is founded by a new media artist Tanja Vujinovic (https://www.tanjav.art/) who has produced and participated in hundreds of IRL and online events in the field of arts and culture. As a highly experienced world builder, an artist , PhD holder in the field of Media arts and philosophy but also curator and event manager, she has presented her works on numerous festivals, in galleries and museum across the world, and recently Metaverse.  The whole team and the structure of the Ultramono LABS is visible on our Discord server: https://discord.gg/dqVXsRr\nBesides already existing team members, we plan to hire few more people who are \"natives\" in Decentraland, mostly for consultations and to initially help facilitate community aspect of the space and establish good monetary practices for all involved and our future audience.\nFlowershop is the latest iteration that spawn from our success in organizing events in VRChat and Sansar, with the idea of making our permanent base in Decentraland and securing our financial sustainability across the Metaverse by making Decentraland our permanent and central home base.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nProgress will be reported on a weekly bases in writing and on our Flowershop community meetup every Saturday at 21:00 CET at our location, in front of everyone interested to hear about the development. Execution of all tasks described in the project proposal will start immediately as our initial funding is secured. Project is expected to be fully executed within three months, with our first public event expected to happen in January 2021. In the meantime, we are starting our with promotion campaign of the whole Flowershop as a cross between a gallery, a club and a concept store on all social media and within our already existing networks, so we could get as much support as possible.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=84c9c400-2dc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)**", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1634309520, "end": 1634914320, "snapshot": "13423287", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 14, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmY6J8BPNpwCMxtcFmL511qcEFvAkLFhw9GpjhJA1zmkBH", "voter": "0x38dAEa6f17E4308b0Da9647dB9ca6D84a3A7E195", "created": 1634899397, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbaJdWp83DXHjekyUEiyuQ3Ckom9mwx5EwmoycPV7ktdg", "voter": "0x99C820E11D5ee26a55755f24F7B6cB55ea782136", "created": 1634822728, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX42ws317c4Z8ZktcusbNibpd6M2ZPvKEZB2VrzB1gKjs", "voter": "0x4EfB206EEc3F109a542639Ef23F3d79Ea09FC02B", "created": 1634822104, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZB2Z6bFm7c2RzVKx3YaAMR6G5jf9zxdTwQDd4vz9iXTJ", "voter": "0xf2c86508ed9D7F74207EE39979Ddf8B9692Ef7D3", "created": 1634689665, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUiwmtAPLkouQpT6ikAQr7MEFBJFazHzNvx1x1EcMBujv", "voter": "0x12EF2cD4231D5CF655a6CDD4Ac1524FFaa439c17", "created": 1634630879, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmea6eTsptDjg2r4QC9kTvLyEd8LC2GktA49VQr76NqkMX", "voter": "0xC54A6C3778016b06cBD126cCc3B5Bc06c5F666fb", "created": 1634570185, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSoy8U3uKjkJ8QUkMuAd2eF5jxn2B3gM5GdMEv8bESxBL", "voter": "0x0928bD64F3c896660c0f32E990bC203cAf360A0A", "created": 1634552322, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWJoMc4np6MgxtwirfNE9P9cJRQLUtogZgcivFdGnNLnY", "voter": "0x598f8af1565003AE7456DaC280a18ee826Df7a2c", "created": 1634523893, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZNRVryFB56TUGTTJvq6Cr8RZnZyFSQcrE91wcgLWAkMi", "voter": "0x7558899d8109D8a2CE457837ADE56C3d6eBFE90d", "created": 1634492904, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXmnVUN4x15CaMahsT3v75W1ECJM7jwnP3KfKHf64vXMM", "voter": "0xea886349d44AA81DE644f0F02105707f563103E6", "created": 1634459048, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVjj9CKBuVkc4yyXB2yX9zNZHQWh148zU8YGpAcxe7T3L", "voter": "0xEe4cE5Ca2C2A76d2346bb1B3E98E01B03553d4E5", "created": 1634368381, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWsKNNaccjWts4gejJxdB5jWU221VxT6Gg7tgqAm4SjWj", "voter": "0xD1570080bcB784b4F5E378dfd4cDfFDfd6C110f6", "created": 1634367261, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZZYK4PMV24UvfT8riiTe9zGpYwtKuu58sNqFccHyCBuL", "voter": "0xd2fAF32104BFF6d15f20375912b92e068b0f442a", "created": 1634320635, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc7dgUvHQVTdgC5NvKfyxAL1tygKWYxpr2HT2R8cUdbmz", "voter": "0xBe51C97dA83156931392F9920965dEE08C0F15Da", "created": 1634316187, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
