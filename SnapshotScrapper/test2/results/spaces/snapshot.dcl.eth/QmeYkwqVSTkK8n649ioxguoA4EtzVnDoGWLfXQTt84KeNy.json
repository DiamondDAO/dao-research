The [Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/) was formed to help with this process.\n\nThere are currently only three individuals sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.\n\nTo help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.\n\n**The candidate**\n\nAfter the [call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047),  Sebastian Valla was nominated:\n\n\"Sebastian is Wonderzone's Art Lead and wearables designer. With a bachelor's degree in 3D modeling and game design, Sebastian has been working as a professional 3D artist for the last 4 years. Since Decentraland's launch in 2020, Sebastian has created over 10 different wearables collections for the Foundation and for Wonderzone. Notable examples include the Wonderbot, Outfit of Wonder, and the Materochaser collections.\n\nSebastian has also worked with numerous members in the community, helping to coach them through the creation and publication process. You can view Sebastian's portfolio on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/sebastianvalla/collections/portfolio).\"\n\n**Compensation**\n\nOn August 20th, 2021, the [DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b) to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review.\n\nCommittee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.\n\n**Necessary qualifications**\n\nCuration Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):\n\n*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation\n*   A full understanding of skin weighting\n*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here\n*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline\n*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO\n*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions\n\n**Should  Sebastian Valla be added to the Wearables Curation Committee?**\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=206ec890-1687-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)**", "choices": ["Yes", "No", "Invalid question/options"], "start": 1631752980, "end": 1632357780, "snapshot": "13233591", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 19, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTUZZroZb7j7CpB3kGBXS6pkWLzZ6RmrTipmtBq9rDthK", "voter": "0x5dA5F4c020f856aBdB168fd35c957D6006ba2edE", "created": 1632350407, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbQCchfjScC4oFjfRkCbYy3tQzgcCZ82Z2RoYqZnETVnh", "voter": "0x45208c10E922D932c0A638e7d8e92307fC73B40b", "created": 1632229553, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZuiaxbEWCCmt3iKoBtK1g6P1fepeBqbY6ffRQTtxFUzK", "voter": "0x780909C4F1305E5953041E744B09E2F016180676", "created": 1632228822, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSujHSmmcwBBXsfbEeFrj4QEBYdtuLopXruDPyEYQWNfY", "voter": "0x7AaAaE8cd46aB71E1e5084d55d9C6b3ea4D970a0", "created": 1632087215, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdRYEGaqSkejzyPC3Wjbxa1jRLftzPpfLoCG1zaq3AmSg", "voter": "0xd5e9eF1CedAd0D135d543D286a2c190B16cBb89E", "created": 1632016543, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUFCVYPPPfD1u1RuzrpBM5USoggLKcvisPPx6JA8AHeKo", "voter": "0x7a7a5fAD8C4107ED0959191e7Ff36Ba82D4ea2F9", "created": 1631954850, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmerYddmivQbHKj8FsbSWwwuAW6DbUCNk9LJfNiBQwtDhd", "voter": "0x9147dc23a24073b7a4210173383b90e6437c507e", "created": 1631940176, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmehCH9JDhpRmVZsh6eDdRAfvipemg2C9YCwdWesUKhP9j", "voter": "0x0f051A642A1c4B2c268C7D6a83186159b149021b", "created": 1631915966, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQfoGG86Z3GWkAbEVnw1KjZLt7oqoADtYvMaGrDaHFJ27", "voter": "0x521B0fEf9CDCf250aBaF8e7BC798CBE13fa98692", "created": 1631913933, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYRN3UurvGJFnfFUemqLoEGf86rF2wFt38zETccEU9LEW", "voter": "0x7BC07eB3B7db966e4F6E5d439f8c33afF5f628B3", "created": 1631891234, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUv972EydDo7q5GVMBkzsBxyWtCA6Wuk7hEN2Q2kEK6sW", "voter": "0xe5F55468585ef91CF1a87aa3aF4c830FA7AE78dE", "created": 1631883254, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSS4k4P6TP5wZYnnUJGRNjDjTMztiJUn3LdgMiP3RAGxC", "voter": "0x8Cff6832174091DAe86F0244e3Fd92d4CeD2Fe07", "created": 1631879611, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPGwYXo5BAEAT5wqXe5gzNtAqWaU6xePLKTfCrbwgR4uC", "voter": "0x7E6d4810eA233d7588E3675d704571e29C4BCbBa", "created": 1631840606, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfP9XK6cKgYw8tZ2DBF1c9x3ibfyBEMmsVKrnBgv5Yc4F", "voter": "0x7B041729A60AC903a18a5B1C1328a300C8D539C3", "created": 1631833746, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeyauocBHBAk7Xoqd5m4KJHoXDjL5PKLH5kPcV3pjjY2r", "voter": "0x9982b469910c2Ee2EA566dCfCc250CDD34056397", "created": 1631816354, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUGNAwd6Lr1dLj9F3ZmGuZhcSEgGPJ21NmJRBJ9k9pPZR", "voter": "0x598f8af1565003AE7456DaC280a18ee826Df7a2c", "created": 1631809814, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme7okq5V8FRd5dKqVMcemaTTVqq7xF2bEzku9UMDe647x", "voter": "0x9dB59920d3776c2d8A3aA0CbD7b16d81FcAb0A2b", "created": 1631802884, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTVfkqBr6MPX1MGw7Ts9g7VsF7KhdkSxRoqT9WijTQFQQ", "voter": "0xe2b6024873d218B2E83B462D3658D8D7C3f55a18", "created": 1631802438, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX6AQVr4ENjhvBhBoN3auf69QmGM8TJhHeqnTbdVyYvnF", "voter": "0x82d54417FC69681dc74A6C0c68C6DBad5A2857B9", "created": 1631780282, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
