{"id": "QmS7jTEw5reRxupAV7jpmhdb8d23ZSWzjsb7Jm6BBzyYWB", "title": "First Futuristic MetaStadium (Football)", "body": "> by 0xaa528f96f7865ef46697dcbb3b4e04cefa91ca0c (Ligebar#ca0c)\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nMy idea is to create a Futuristic Stadium in Decentraland for people to play 5vs5 against their friends. People will be able to book the stadium at different times, create teams, play, watch games on the available seats, beat on winning players and more. Teams will be able to play for free or bet a sum of MANA. The winning team will take the total sum of the beat and MANA will be divided equally and sent to the winning players. It will be fun and a great experience both for players and spectators.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n4,999 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xAA528F96f7865Ef46697dCbb3B4E04cEfA91Ca0C\n\n## Description\n\nI will bring entertainment to Decentraland. People will be able to play friendly games 5vs5, create tournaments or championships and win MANA prizes. More and more people will try Decentraland and this game experience.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nI will need Builders, and people that will work on the scripting side of the project. The grant will also cover part of the Marketing and Land acquisition.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI will be working on the Marketing side of the project since I have more than 5 years of experience in Marketing and social media. I will need builders, coders and lands.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nFirst step: Buy Lands - 4 parcels to start - By December 2021\nSecond step: Find Builders and coders - By December 2021\nThird step: Start building the stadium, gaming experience and coding - By May 2022\nFourth step: Work on the Marketing side - Ongoing\nFifth step: Test everything and update Decentraland community on Discord - By May 2022\nSixth step: Improve Gaming experience based on Feedback - Ongoing\nSeventh step: Launch - By September 2022\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=51a09220-dd72-11eb-815a-1f002ccf0372)**", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1625476860, "end": 1626081660, "snapshot": "12766641", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 15, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUq2x5i53WfQPFYJ7YNBJhgWPk7dapd5rJcLW5yvFR889", "voter": "0x5F5Ee55a39F31ED067927a3E5D96072277259cf7", "created": 1625788224, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfTMynSowvrdGsR1PxHsfqg8n78zExCdbadfxDEAfuL9R", "voter": "0xc5B4e3ed8b30BF691BfDA2D1604080A6781D0FC3", "created": 1625779210, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfSsUdmEq22ZiyVdXKUQA9S6XJYxkqtiX36bSoRq4PP1T", "voter": "0x1F149885Bb140F07ff88de2aC4d521bC27964c1b", "created": 1625773665, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTW9E1zyjxoqsQpWbHwbe3mGKdkizmCUnoSrZyRF3PgmA", "voter": "0x521B0fEf9CDCf250aBaF8e7BC798CBE13fa98692", "created": 1625603248, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVtWzk9bMApTgAzANoyp3gGaMQ9nzC2zPWeopWLEmGUf1", "voter": "0x97cA90AB3A66ABda308f0B238f2bB27aab48735f", "created": 1625601267, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcB1idL5VrMVpxswHZhLXtp2FwRqjQfrHVHZbMUZscR29", "voter": "0x8DD060AD7f867ad890490fd87657c1b7e63C622f", "created": 1625581441, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPXXV4bhdhiTWXoVwNZfJbG48gQ6L2fqyEucZCaQEywKU", "voter": "0x76fb13f00CdbdD5eAC8E2664CF14be791aF87cb0", "created": 1625571353, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaUisWiHS97Z1HNmHTWKJaajmAM4MrWN6ZRHkseCD9WhX", "voter": "0xc6e2861D007DAc67e8d4b62c6620ED8D7706404a", "created": 1625536073, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT7t3iZWYu8EnWDX1WxdNoU8i1TUDWEiz1j8w2tY2xMao", "voter": "0x3609cd1dF99274f09D60cDF669E5BF8073FbD94f", "created": 1625533798, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmeyo8XbAfHe3BkR27pryWPnviimf4nm5fUMxErL4nvZwF", "voter": "0x99Ec37c145060fE7Ee9E346C3d40cB7Fd28ED80F", "created": 1625530959, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXwfLrXXmCVU9wVrVEp6goTnzF7tSo8Jcd6Tr47111T64", "voter": "0xd210DC1dd26751503CbF1B8c9154224707820da8", "created": 1625525640, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdVfhEiEE2VK1neikmEGLzA4CAqGD7Tkrg5YUnfy2FLvA", "voter": "0xe5E9D85D384c88a82d242152d5b6798b54CF4436", "created": 1625511913, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeGkQ9tckmCL4FgwkJNGMEEaQW4yfv6s3HK2RTSaekZQ3", "voter": "0x7BC07eB3B7db966e4F6E5d439f8c33afF5f628B3", "created": 1625506105, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUKDzku3sieXFivT57HDyDm2dKdX4M7zCqRGhhWJcEj4P", "voter": "0x08261144eC8E7f166aA02D2fb920B856f7ceD094", "created": 1625498825, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTBjvHvQCvE2GNaApZ4tawPECGePtrTLGgvQYsH6krvoH", "voter": "0x3fB38CEe8d0BA7Dcf59403a8C397626dC9c7A13B", "created": 1625486241, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
