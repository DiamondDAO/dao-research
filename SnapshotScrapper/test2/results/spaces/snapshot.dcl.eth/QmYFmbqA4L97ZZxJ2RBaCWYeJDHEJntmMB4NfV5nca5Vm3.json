Rather than having to manually adjust these prices, what if a seller could simply say \"always target the equivalent of $5 USD\". Obviously this would be an opt-in system as not everyone would want to, but it would help prevent this situation from happening again.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7ccdd730-3a67-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**", "choices": ["Yes", "No", "Invalid question/options"], "start": 1635697620, "end": 1636302420, "snapshot": "13525872", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
