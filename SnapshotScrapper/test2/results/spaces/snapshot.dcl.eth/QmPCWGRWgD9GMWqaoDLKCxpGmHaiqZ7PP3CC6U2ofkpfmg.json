(Sign into Metamask or connect your wallet to view the DAO's [vesting dashboard](https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac).) This MANA was set aside to support the continued development of the Decentraland platform by funding  decisions made by MANA holders and LAND owners through the DAO.\n\nAs of the time this proposal was published, `30,578,217` of that MANA has vested, and is now available to the DAO's treasury.\n\nIt is risky for the DAO to keep only MANA (its native governance token) in its treasury. To help guarantee that the treasury's balance remains wisely managed, the DAO's treasury should diversify across bluechip assets (e.g. ETH or BTC), stablecoins (e.g. DAI or USDC), and other assets such as a DeFi index (DPI) which may enable the DAO to earn yield.\n\nSpreading the DAO's holdings across these different assets will help to stabilize the DAO's entire treasury in the face of market fluctuations.\n\nMaintaining a stable treasury is a critical step toward enabling the DAO to fulfill its obligations to the Decentraland community, e.g. grants. The recently approved [Grants Framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49) specifies that each grant is to be paid in MANA, according to the exchange rate between USD and MANA at the time of the transaction.\n\nMaintaining a cushion of stable coins within the treasury will help to maximize the number, size, and duration of grants that the DAO can fund in the long term.\n\nMany other DAOs are beginning to explore initiatives such as this, as is discussed in [this article and the related report](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/dao-treasury-balance-sheet-management-ce5e96da34ac) from the Blockchain Capital blog.\n\n*\\*\\*In conclusion, the DAO should exchange 1/5th of its treasury (or `6,115,643` MANA) for a portfolio of stable coins containing equal proportions of USDT, USDC, and DAI. \\*\\**\n\nThe remaining 4/5ths of the treasury will remain in MANA.\n\n**Specification**\n\n1/5th of the DAO's existing treasury, or `6,115,643` MANA, is to be exchanged for USDC, USDT, and DAI stable coins, with to the following distribution:\n\n*   `2,038,547.66` USDC\n*   `2,038,547.66` USDT\n*   `2,038,547.66` DAI\n\nThe transaction is to be conducted by the DAO Committee's multisig, requiring the signature of all three members.\n\n**For**\n\nApprove the proposed asset allocation and delegate the transaction to the DAO Committee.\n\n**Against**\n\nReject the proposed asset allocation.\n\n- For\n- Against\n\n\n**[Vote
