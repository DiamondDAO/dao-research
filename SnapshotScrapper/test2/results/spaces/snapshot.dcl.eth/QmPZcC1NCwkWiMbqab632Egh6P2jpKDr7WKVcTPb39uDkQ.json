This will allow Creators to expand existing collections within their 'brand' without having to plan and create every item within the collection beforehand. Of course, additions to existing collections would still require the same review by the Wearables Committee as any other item would prior to being published to the metaverse.\n\nThe reason for suggesting such an improvement is to allow for future expansion to existing collections, as well as to keep the collections within the marketplace and in-game wardrobes relatively organized. There are already Creators with a handful of separate published collections that may be better suited to live all in one collection, if the system allowed to add to existing contracts.\n\nEase of technological implementation aside, this poll constitutes a community ' 'temperature check' to get the issue out into the world and start discussing quality of life improvements such as these. Thank you for considering this request.\n\n- Yes, allow Creators to publish new wearables to their existing collections.\n- No, continue to require Creators to make a new collection with each wearables submission.\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=39bd4180-e579-11eb-bb4e-e9e2ebbd7fce)**", "choices": ["Yes, allow Creators to publish new wearables to their existing collections.", "No, continue to require Creators to make a new collection with each wearables submission."], "start": 1626359400, "end": 1626964200, "snapshot": "12832062", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 18, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXrxwBLuTpauebanLZnuGdeUZRSQBEmfURyzoHCZ3oPNU", "voter": "0xAf0E126d11161fd002200e980103b78470e660E4", "created": 1626809116, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma8Xs37ns214prAW7tdVrKuguDXSzmBeZS3uQosUGCQW7", "voter": "0x478849Da9C519dEd12d04EC6E896Af6aDf3cDD73", "created": 1626779937, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUd9CJYHe27d7sJgbjjvTkn7WfA7z9aE6J8YivuEZUW4M", "voter": "0x521B0fEf9CDCf250aBaF8e7BC798CBE13fa98692", "created": 1626775684, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYMziAz1b4eMhYTMMXSjBNB1yoXaMV1XSQXaKvKzYz2r5", "voter": "0x7a7a5fAD8C4107ED0959191e7Ff36Ba82D4ea2F9", "created": 1626765588, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV1wAeWDMW3J8Q4VCufyBb1UL3qqoGcwE7nb5zAbdhtCZ", "voter": "0x17a253C2Ac0D5BA92cadBbf665e3390C9913DC5d", "created": 1626730286, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmdpp7e58bxbPWiQN7KmHLg2L1q4h7vQKTpZKSawZub3wM", "voter": "0x0f08f5cF0905498Ac6A8B5fF3d4C2AcB5fF447F7", "created": 1626721662, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZbE2WFp3ZTB5eZimnSzoaawkMvpMzbUHd9KrnPLr4NG4", "voter": "0x3fB38CEe8d0BA7Dcf59403a8C397626dC9c7A13B", "created": 1626704720, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR3svpjnED6n9yHiA1Nzyc6XUTtMCypxAZHLm2Kci2yni", "voter": "0x0952B8FD87363Dbbb5eff36ae64c61fF76aA4c02", "created": 1626557425, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc1SxzbDuGbw6zDu9gaA2FHYWNiQq345ZhmXvXqQ7a2ee", "voter": "0x1F149885Bb140F07ff88de2aC4d521bC27964c1b", "created": 1626537325, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmStfmmshii22gPsiqC3DArYcVAx3rBPpWqBbMBnSKoJfB", "voter": "0x509CDeBBa232E7B7f603db5C93D1e4f1FeD9c6F8", "created": 1626499213, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR9h6oNx48DwfBm6WaTWuhfJLz5PWziGYg1pTn4X8gn3v", "voter": "0xA5c8A62F221aDeaf8A7c0BEF60044861D9C4b400", "created": 1626473903, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbxtfEfbWQxsUBYZrcpzqJqTVMFUwYsbkTSRqQXpWz9WC", "voter": "0x0a7e606eB21C80C28A005DAeB5f3d99A40d6B154", "created": 1626393677, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNS9z97hwAWwewPWuoW1VcX6YHWyCw9wUDS51cskNKdiD", "voter": "0x231557D79f2320a46cC61D97070a7d64664ED2df", "created": 1626379568, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSZHbejh2YRupVeAaAgy87uwfmykDxjC6MyQsE2j1keYB", "voter": "0x3beC652537EBF756d9c5f471f33B28278b1DD26D", "created": 1626360415, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRf3czh9v75423QCdhUECCW6tpx2Hqu115xJgTPxm2nVn", "voter": "0x47DCBdF671dC8808d1397bDA92B2cAA4a7c4e951", "created": 1626360051, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdbYptRPhENcKR9E6BRyPq2ZM1x1KR5aSGNJ8k6bkT6Xj", "voter": "0x82d54417FC69681dc74A6C0c68C6DBad5A2857B9", "created": 1626360036, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX5rhKgScgfP4JXMjJVcroQUge3aDWU4Dp4dWXtUPsfaT", "voter": "0xDF8Fc03e54F93e67CfEC067889a01Fb4AF6BAF8b", "created": 1626359736, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmahVEdLqYMyuSMSmCEC2cZKBnKrkUbQ6q5VzhzZSfZa6p", "voter": "0xE58D9940A395D303e691dbe0676710D9C140101A", "created": 1626359603, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
