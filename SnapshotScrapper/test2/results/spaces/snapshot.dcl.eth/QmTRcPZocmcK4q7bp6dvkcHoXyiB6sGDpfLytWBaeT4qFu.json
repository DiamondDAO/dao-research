Players jump on top of objects to complete the parkour course.\n\nI was very happy this morning seeing a user using my Parkour Park:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/dJu67Hc\n\nI would like to reward players that climb the parkour with a wearable tracksuit so they are incentivized to explore the map.\n\nThe wearable Tracksuit will be a 2 Piece Unisex Set of Pant and Jacket of a Color that will be determined in the future.\n\nThis grant is only to cover the publication fee for these wearable Tracksuits.\n\nMy Goal for this project is to incentivize players to Explore More By Giving them Wearables after Finishing the Parkour Challenge.\n\nI'm a Software Developer, More about me in the description\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x815Bd8454F9FAD2415A7903C7De310c130f9b117\n\n## Description\n\nParkour Park:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/bTPZsKg\n\nI built a Parkour Park on land that I'm operating. Someone was kind enough to let me build on his land.\n\nI would like to reward users of my Parkour Park with Wearable tracksuits so everyone goes to the Park to Grab his Tracksuit Set.\n\nHere is a picture of someone using my Parkour Park:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/dJu67Hc\n\nMy goal is to incentivize players to explore newly built parcels by rewarding them with wearables.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nMy Parkour Park:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/bTPZsKg\n\nIn order to complete my project, I will create a wearable Tracksuit that will be claimable after climbing the parkour.\n\nI'm very confident in my abilities to perform this job because of my preliminary work.\n\nThe main obstacle for this project was finding the land to operate because parcels are very costly but right now I'm operating 12 plots which are enough for this job but the parkour is expected to be 1x1 to not take much space.\n\nThe tasks left to complete for this project are:\n\n1.  Creating 3D Models of Tracksuits\n\n2.  Submit outfits for review\n\n3.  Integrate Outfit to Parkour Park\n\nI'm very confident that my background as a software developer will help me complete this work. I have experience developing in c# as a full-stack developer. In my free time, I do 3d Modeling and Unity\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThis is planned to be a solo operation but the Land was provided by the user Gucci.\n\nMy portfolio of VR and Desktop Games:\nhttps://javierromancruz1.itch.io/\n\nAs you can see in the games I'm used to working with 3D Models and New Technologies.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nRoadmap\n\n1.  Creating 3D Models of Tracksuits\n\n2.  Submit outfits for review\n\n3.  Integrate Outfit to Parkour Park\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=29d776a0-405f-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1636353780, "end": 1636958580, "snapshot": "13574286", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 14, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x34c72d6ddebf6fca523ae3e9c9cf15f7fa214a77914002990c61a663c8b4eac3", "voter": "0x38dAEa6f17E4308b0Da9647dB9ca6D84a3A7E195", "created": 1636925965, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbvMjQ8H5FMTt28AJYc12iKmrkE43rvRV1BseWJ65SkmK", "voter": "0x6a8076e1b8fC43D5e07d03Ba090d7a19e1cdafd1", "created": 1636676557, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTsPMUmzhiYNi6h4UzUw1gWqagwKEbgvX31xKGRBhqHhM", "voter": "0xa4244F6711052752E6Bb0271Bf17c756E6598406", "created": 1636674344, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmabWw5cn8L8AxRukZYfgDcBuHqh1rpMZJmuiw9o9C65zh", "voter": "0x66b1488a32E21f2d2757713D16facd9d25Ec977c", "created": 1636650345, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmckNqKJjRqBkM6tNhD44Byjmhzy1TSJyS3TEnMeXPyzsp", "voter": "0x059d0025E4e1Bb1a37F2C922e54b139Bc1231eE0", "created": 1636643371, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ2wZ5SYnXs2YjKv92VyUX8XKoCgFzsTrnmzpCmg5nLun", "voter": "0x6cAa802c6895ECD31601518C7f6B9eF6f9349238", "created": 1636638939, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma1CUx5doSHRRKi26kBLdWhYgCNGhQAxM68N1MsvDGaw5", "voter": "0x6194A166ba7560fa0Bde0a07c93e714574a1dF3f", "created": 1636631010, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNMdNxrBtok2tS7tpPEXSiHHBHRewofpHUnn2cArxf8Bf", "voter": "0x7820FD2ca0ccaBa83B3639a2D5343573B7989863", "created": 1636516038, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "0x5117a4ad498223041a0a41778c3ad5636c2e2af51d5d983774e54f8653e8c941", "voter": "0x5A78F0A330092bF0c3D6cbd85712019329FC08aB", "created": 1636421228, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWBHbYF48Y5zDquXvtKFSf4bCoTAxZExK6Hnjj6qiKwS8", "voter": "0x6D260572BebC98A1b1960b3ce260BD00f9393336", "created": 1636417270, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc4WFeJWK6SMfRsQZQqbv9qK2MANSKfL4zURuYefY4WhH", "voter": "0xcAD1f3de1777b513D88BafB08fC2BEa5EeD98c50", "created": 1636398036, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmdzg1WUmYrCUbcq73NzhPqzYBY29JmTLhMXUPvEXQpE1B", "voter": "0x54e0B906138458a046C95FAfB0Fd429469A15937", "created": 1636389498, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbFErDtJywfQdCavLaQjGTejPkKWikggAkCT71kVLgynX", "voter": "0xBbEEC2733f441b144726F819D4D8DEe82F65b4F2", "created": 1636367896, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "0x28306d6fc5c6c53e076f49019d85a6f563313afca488e9b4c8ddb2e74c44b58a", "voter": "0xA9d43EC8FEa0f874B4f6F1eA4b52D8546eFCD3eB", "created": 1636362212, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
