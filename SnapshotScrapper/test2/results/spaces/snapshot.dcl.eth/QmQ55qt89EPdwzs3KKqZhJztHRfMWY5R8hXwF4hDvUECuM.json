I am grateful to find a game that actually is enjoyable. As I have tried to learn more about what is possible within the platform, common occurrences have brought a thought to mind: when I purchase a parcel to build an estate - could it be possible to only build in Loki - Amber? As content is added to the platform would this not be an asset feature: the ability to allow all forms of expression but to enable users to select what they are exposed to. It also triples the available parcels to allocate.\n\n- Sortition ( 3-D ownership )\n- Psephos ( 1-D ownership )\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=0ee13330-bf0a-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301)**", "choices": ["Sortition ( 3-D ownership )", "Psephos ( 1-D ownership )"], "start": 1622133540, "end": 1622738340, "snapshot": "12517478", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPPD8CsvZKqPUAqH5WntcbFSzQFbpDgcpS52UTNoi9Uq9", "voter": "0x3cB9e515E2452937B501734AA2cc8ea673c28f27", "created": 1622688889, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdRJwdZrkcJyM1yFcnmJddyArbdgQrui6Kp3eDYmU7vwZ", "voter": "0x1F149885Bb140F07ff88de2aC4d521bC27964c1b", "created": 1622491288, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXHXVE2V4Fecpv1T1qSSFXaxRthqk5qgbf1h1tzpELevH", "voter": "0xd210DC1dd26751503CbF1B8c9154224707820da8", "created": 1622421838, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSMYfCfD7Bfnjye6XVL1KcfKEeVUajVUueQwHLFQtjf5H", "voter": "0xD2D950CeA649fEEf4D6111C18ADBD9a37B3a9f63", "created": 1622390831, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
