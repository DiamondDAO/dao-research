{"id": "QmamRjwDEvhYC3Wm77p1LDb1ob1nC57hP6dicqS8bNMMKv", "title": "Update the Decentraland Terms of Use and Content Policy", "body": "> by 0x4837f2542050744faf8215a5c401b86a01b6b91d\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn response to the recent release of the Wearables Editor, the DAO may want to provide formal approval to the updated Terms of Use and Content Policy. Aside from the inclusion of wearables, the newly proposed Terms of Use and Content Policy do not bring significant changes to the prior versions of these two documents.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThe Decentraland Terms of Use and Content Policy are in need of some updates, which should be approved by the Decentraland DAO:\n\n**Wearables**\n\nThe recent release of the Wearables Editor, which allows the community to mint NFTs, requires certain adjustments in the Terms of Use. More generally, certain adjustments have been made to present the driving philosophy of Decentraland in clearer and simpler language, i.e. that Decentraland users exclusively hold the IP rights over their creations.\n\n**General cleanup and edits for clarity**\n\nCertain minor adjustments and edits have been introduced throughout both documents to improve their clarity and readability,  making it easier to understand their  provisions.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe specific, detailed modifications called for above have been made within the Terms of Use and Content Policy. You can view both documents, pending the DAO's approval through this proposal, here:\n\n*   [Terms of Use](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16R8JjoHastrJXyTW7pj0DQ4Vf4Tp-cEQ/view?usp=sharing)\n*   [Content Policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eyxcJuKf-e8f5Jm_lOKiB7YjM6ApnbFL/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**For**\n\nApprove the updated Content Policy and Terms of Use.\n\n**Against**\n\nReject the updated Content Policy and Terms of Use.\n\n- For\n- Against\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7e3f57c0-e0f2-11eb-a20f-d75df7f87ed8)**", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1625861760, "end": 1626466560, "snapshot": "12795252", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5E23D08324f017d5425e59A2782C9ae27aCE0958", "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth", "name": "Decentraland"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZuaPCBMB5Q3fgQdPXzmGZaxMVZHZF7wzEn9VZEUpR6VA", "voter": "0xD11a019a70986Bd607CBC1c1f9Ae221C78581F49", "created": 1626435571, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWuD7xBtxEhYnXWKaBmYitri3h63eKLRBWcbmqhgdKmBW", "voter": "0x4EfB206EEc3F109a542639Ef23F3d79Ea09FC02B", "created": 1626375554, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTcv6934KutEHU5vT9Dud8KtcVZsB9us6wzXDTypoLJVu", "voter": "0x26E36DB00A79f4A50B9e6Eb24f651abEC8570a03", "created": 1626283889, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcLNCkpDtXgUoSQjZAv5i6ahHPV5nTXgZUX1zViE8VHnH", "voter": "0xF081eDa01d8D3b10F6F93fF1459339b9eD174D3C", "created": 1626182373, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma94eD3SvkFkyToiDdz76LZv4C26TQspKorKKNGbm7GRm", "voter": "0x0a7e606eB21C80C28A005DAeB5f3d99A40d6B154", "created": 1626057262, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaS6cxUThgoDvLwZu1QdHrskmJkVYReR2HEH1z3hnbkgF", "voter": "0x71ea92992a66d8F82b31893ca46BeEB169B8650B", "created": 1625988848, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWZW4jt5GpuxTbKhYVW6BY2FEVyNuLKdasDd1yNRE7A7c", "voter": "0xb89439631C7aaE815F927C0Bd0Da5ac9C2BBe933", "created": 1625951787, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaYUnUymwDReja58QegetFUnj1GsqWrjbaTbWL8E3Pb4K", "voter": "0x338AD1918362025F34b3701DaC1E9648E8e8268f", "created": 1625872184, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "snapshot.dcl.eth"}}]}
