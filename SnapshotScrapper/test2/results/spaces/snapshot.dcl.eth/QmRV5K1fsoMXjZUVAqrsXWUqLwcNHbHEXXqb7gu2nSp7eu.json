RPSBET has been a 5 year project for us, we\u2019ve combined so many features into the platform to ensure we make a super efficient income x gaming engine that is product/market fit. These things include Player Vs. Player (Bankroll)\u2014to allow 24 hour games to run, skilled-based games only\u2014to give users full control and an exchange-like UI\u2014for setting stop losses (auto-payouts). More features include a 'Kaiji' inspired NFT card game, where users can use their liquidity knowledge as their high-skill component. Preview a card here: https://bit.ly/3B8Cjek. The platform could integrate nicely with Decentraland and offer a more PVP experience.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xB8Cc65eF61cb183C671b33B40D5D544EaBCDcba6\n\n## Description\n\nWe aim to become the first Gambling-to-Earn Platform, a safe gambling space; using skilled-based games as way of increasing your control rate with lower risk than typical gambling. Help us have a truly decentralized experience by voting on our partnership with Decentraland.org.\n\nThe problem with High-Risk Gambling & creating Quick Cash:\n(1) Timely & Addictive in a bad way\n(2) Time != Increased Earnings (this is bad practice)\n\nThe solution to Gambling & Creating an Income \u2014RPSBET;\n(1) RPS encourages users to stake (benefit from token taxes) their bets vs. just putting tokens 'on the line'\n(2) Player Vs. Player\u2014Truly House-Free, Zero House Edge\n(3) Skilled-based\u2014Higher Control Rate, No Random, Provably-Fair Algorithms (e.g. dice games)\n(4) Bankrolled Games w/ stop-loss capabilities\u2014set up automatic games, run them 24 Hours.\n\nWe had 5 years of development and testing time, so we've had the time to test the theory and made improvements after 4 trials to reach what we think now is product/market fit, **just need that final stage of development paid for** (the integration)\u2014but maybe this is a sign from Decentraland to pursue this partnership?\n\n*\u201cGamification participants score 14% higher in skill-based assessments\u201d*\n\nWith RPSBET, we could ensure an ethical future for Decentraland or it could even work in favour with the traditional gambling games to attract a wider user base as we see RPSBET an ideal fit for the current selection of games. We're behind Decentraland's motive of 'Being the House' and have come up with our own unique casino-like games that you can test so far using PayPal or Login with Metamask to receive some free virtual money to play with (as we're still in Beta):\n\n**RPSBET.IO Games**\n\nRock Paper Scissors\nThis game is very simple: rock vs paper vs scissors. You can create a game and choose your\nchoice. If you join a game and for example you choose rock. Once you have chosen your bet, you place it and find out the outcome.\n\nBrain Game\u2014\nBrain Game questions set to test your knowledge against other users. This mode allows you to set a high score which you want others to beat. When playing against this bet, your bet is then placed and you have to attempt the questions. If you are able to beat the high score then you take the pot.\n\nSpleesh\u2014\nNumber guessing game with a growing pot. Aimed for long-term holds. Plenty of mind games involved when users Join as they go for cheaper guesses you could sweep them by choosing a higher, more expensive number. Don\u2019t risk leaving your money in too long as they will eventually guess it! So be sure to set auto-payouts.\n\nMystery Box\u2014\nA new and improved Deal or No Deal. Pick the right box and you could win up to 50x your buy-in. Massive gains to be made from this game. If you are to guess incorrectly then\nyour amount is added to the bankroll for the bet.\n\nQuick Shoot\u2014\nQuick shoot allows the user to pick where to save the goal by allowing the user to pick a pinpoint on the goal. The user creates a game. Other users then try to score and pay the fee to attempt the shot to win the prize sum.\n\nStratosphere (coming soon!)\u2014\nThe first PvP Crash site with permission from Daniel @Bustabit!\n\nDrop Game (coming soon!)\u2014\nBet NFTs value against another's, the rarer your NFT, the higher chance you have of winning.\n\nRestricted RPS (coming soon!)\u2014\nRPS w/ NFTs (different odds)\n\nThe Royal Boycott (coming soon!)\u2014\nHorse racing, mint your own NFT Horses and stake them to earn rewards and improve on their value.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Final Requirements to go LIVE**\nRPSBET.IO\nLeaderboards to work with $RPS\nFix \u2018Join Game\u2019 pages\nHide other gamemodes (or fix them)\nWrite smart contracts for \u2018Freeplay\u2019 & Fixed (almost the same)\nSmart contracts for converting community tax into $DG tokens\nUser Player Profiles to work with $RPS\nUpdate all automatic messages & game Logs to work with $RPS\nTestnet Launch\nMainnet Launch RPSBET.IO\nOf course we're going to need UI components and animations for the new Decentraland API so this needs to be considered.\n\n**$RPS Protocol Summary**\nWhen HOST clicks \u2018Place Bet\u2019 they will sign their transaction in Metamask.\nBets are pre-determined, so need to hash user\u2019s choice (e.g. rock, paper or scissors)\nHOST\u2019s $RPS will be stored in an escrow address and will automatically send XX Amount of $RPS when PLAYER Joins & Wins\nELSE IF PLAYER Loses against HOST, their $RPS is sent to the escrow.\nWhen HOST ENDs their BET, $RPS is released from the escrow address and sent to HOST.\n\nOR\n\nWe can just use React.Js/Node.Js to handle who Wins/Loses.\n\n***\n\n**PSEUDO CODE (For \u2018FIXED RPS\u2019\u2014*Please don't judge me on my Psuedo code!*)**\n\nCreate_Game_Fixed_RPS.sol\n\nGame = Array {\ngameID = auto_generated code\nescrowAmount = $rps\npublic Address = random or set Addresss?\nisGameOpen = bool\nBets.json: { keccak256\\_hash(choice) + Bet Amount + isIndexOpen }\n}\n\nCreateGame() {\nHide/Hash Choice e.g. rock | paper | scissors\nTransfer $rps Amount from Host\u2019s wallet to Escrow Address e.g. 0x7B429E1a7b6Dd855Df95AE7b5C8C86C7e0fAC83A\n(timestamp) + gameID stored in block\n(generate prvt key?)\n\n}\n\nJoin_Game_Fixed_RPS.sol\n\nisIndexOpen = bool\nisLastGame = bool\nYes = True\nNo = Fale\nWaiting = (True, await(5s))\n\ncalcFees(once | twice + Amount) {\nIF\tOnce = amount \\* 0.96\nELSE  Twice = amount \\* 0.9216\n}\n\nisGameOpen() {\ngetGameID\nIF isGameOpen(True) {\nReturn Yes\n}\n}\n\nisLastGame() {\nCheckIndex(game)\nIF no_more_indexes_are_open -> isGameOpen = FALSE\n}\n\nexecuteWinnings(game) {\nDecode_Hash_At_Index_Being_Requested\nIF W -> TransferFromEscrow(calcFees(Bet_Amount \\* 2)) to Joiner\u2019s Wallet\nELSE L -> *do nothing*\nisIndexOpen(gameID, getIndex) {\nReturn False\n}\n}\n\nJoinGame() {\nGET block for selected gameID\nIF isGameOpen(yes|no|waiting) {\nTransfer $rps Amount from Joiner\u2019s wallet to Escrow Address e.g. 0xD44304DA48f234eb63a49e1Ae3A8ACdA3a71a25a\nisIndexOpen = False\nisLastGame()\nexecuteWinnings()\n}\n\n}\n\nEnd_Game_Fixed_RPS.sol\n\nEndGame(game) {\nGet Host\u2019s Prvt Key\nIF isGameOpen(yes) {\nisGameOpen = False\n}\nTransfer escrowAmount to Joiner\u2019s Wallet\n}\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nHi, So I\u2019m Lenny, CEO of RPSBET.
