(100% of the removed liquidity will be re-added)\n- Kuma holders deposit old KUMA tokens to the Migration contract and claim v2 tokens. (There will be bonus tokens which are coming from Unstaking fee of Kuma Breeder.)\n\nWe will keep the same tokenomics as before.\n50% of total supply which has been kept by VB's wallet will be burnt.\nAdditional 10% which was allocated for Co-founders will be also burnt.\n", "choices": ["Approve", "Approve"], "start": 1623207600, "end": 1623466800, "snapshot": "12600540", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB9916a346e24bA1FE7E9D37Cecd8fD82851e15C5", "space": {"id": "kumainu.eth", "name": "Kuma Inu"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
