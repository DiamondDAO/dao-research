Passionate hatcher and supporter here of both TEC and CS \ud83d\udc9a I'm submitting this proposal in the hopes to create a conversation and evaluation team around a potential high-impact go-to-market strategy.\nBefore I start, please forgive me if this contravenes TEC processes or just all around doesn't make sense - happy to can it - as I'm not fully in the loop.\n\n-- Proposal Information:\n\nHypothesis 1:\nTEC consists of the best token engineers in the web3 space. Other very wealthy DAOs are desperately craving counsel on their token and incentive structures... \ud83d\udca1 PraiseBots, hatch parameters, bonding curve issuance are incredible design parameters few DAOists know about.\n\nHypothesis 2:\nIt feels to me sometimes a bit like the TEC community is over-engineering its own design params. Dogfooding the dogfood. The Hatch took a long time and in my opinion was in some aspects convoluted bc. we wanted to experiment with multiple designs - best intentions of course.\n\n-- Idea:\nWhat if the TEC community began integrating its amazing ideas into the many DAOs that face big incentive problems and through that rapidly prototype the tool kit. \n1. This could create massive networks effects for TEC DAO via other DAOs\n2. Enable rapid prototyping of the core stack and toolset that TEC is trying to build. Good user feedback is the hardest thing to get. And desperate users are the best users.\n3. Also imagine how many token designers we might attract from those DAOs.\n4. Lastly, creating sustainable income/token swaps + helping others in need\n\nDogfooding only works for so long \ud83d\udc36  and the opportunity here to help is incredible IMO. We can always revert to our own tooling and perfect that!\n\n-- Proposal Ask: create a small 3-week project team to evaluate if, what and how TEC tooling could be serviced to another DAO for income. Requires time commitments.\n\n-- Outcome: identify one DAO that will buy a solution (effectively the design-thinking to help implement a TEC module) for income & integrating a TEC module into the wild. Why paid? Because that increases the stakes and expectations and good work deserves to be paid.\n\nInsert meme: \"You guys are getting paid?\"\n\n-- Team\nI couldn't lead this but could certainly help source DAOs.", "choices": ["Yay", "Nay"], "start": 1632996000, "end": 1633600800, "snapshot": "18335053", "state": "closed", "author": "0x45602BFBA960277bF917C1b2007D1f03d7bd29e4", "space": {"id": "tecommons.eth", "name": "Token Engineering Commons"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdbVS5AxVvTEJGpqYydhJGUMgTi1yWonozipBPumLynj5", "voter": "0xb525F6b3b5EFCC0C54582de2F08D890F7793e3e4", "created": 1633549407, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tecommons.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPvsCJoUoNtkB6u3ge9a3EA4absv5jSFZ84HkayFDWb1v", "voter": "0x66dF5A7715C5D4AfbBFA52435c66aa20733be0d1", "created": 1633476309, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "tecommons.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXsezGdxsjn8PGtctMKQxrqFH5B9GgczQ5PDZkGMKKAzv", "voter": "0x45602BFBA960277bF917C1b2007D1f03d7bd29e4", "created": 1633459704, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tecommons.eth"}}]}
