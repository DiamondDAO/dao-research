Half of the tokens will be locked until January 2022. \n\nAll of the current guild members that leave their wallet address will receive 2 of the tokens for voting at no cost.\n\nThis leaves a yet undetermined amount of tokens left unlocked. A portion of these unlocked tokens is what would be placed on PancakeSwap. If the vote passes we will run another vote on the amount to allocate and price to set.\n\nBenefits : \n1. Can bring attention to the guild if people see the token on PancakeSwap\n2. A way for guild members to give up their governance rights \n", "choices": ["Yes list it", "No don't list it", "No use a different exchange"], "start": 1628236200, "end": 1631462400, "snapshot": "9791026", "state": "closed", "author": "0xA1a2f43966CFf194a0BA2506C084EF8dbec855BE", "space": {"id": "eggs.eth", "name": "Samurai Guild"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQe98xZX1iVh6f51vQk7atykrMFYnG8Q5VhNjViSxrs6c", "voter": "0xE9CD9Ec57E7536Ef1aFE881e7adE308F7563FfB1", "created": 1628912837, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "eggs.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRpUbSiYY1PipgXgbyP83i7AShgcbhGHH2zuTra3F45fT", "voter": "0x6B1fED4e0A74a629Bd8787F366bA1d3a0Fed3b14", "created": 1628772079, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "eggs.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmamu54bhyGGNk6qosfaGQVhsnDqnGwzmtXt8Qqu85kqws", "voter": "0xeD063d4B7e06618Db52b1A965f5449f6477aA9FD", "created": 1628237548, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "eggs.eth"}}]}
