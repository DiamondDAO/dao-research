In order to make a fair vote with everyone included would be nice to create a separate vCAKE token for all CAKE holders so this governance token can be used for voting. This way whoever owns CAKE, can vote while using different platforms for staking rewards without having to unstake.\n\nI am not sure how difficult this would be to achieve through but we should look into this direction to ensure all our votings have the full community support instead of people ignoring it due to the fact they have to unstake/restake (costs alot of money, especially on certain yield aggregator plattforms).\n\nLet me know if this is a interesting proposal, or atleast if we can look into this direction so myself (and many others) can vote with their full power without having to make any changes in their strategies.", "choices": ["Create vCAKE for voting", "Dont create vCAKE for voting"], "start": 1615618800, "end": 1616324400, "snapshot": "5636886", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3e8734Ec146C981E3eD1f6b582D447DDE701d90c", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmeHZSbFv1ef554WB9TXauSGK9yzykNFqGBXs9t9V43hWM", "voter": "0x601aD0661e139e9b8244f9B4Fa4b99Fb0De96cb2", "created": 1616251259, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmWtErVKM4mwTkuYWwS4b6fTgM1iv6nTWyEWaNwvmCcVgB", "voter": "0x78E15f4898027fD9b9Aa2E69634E2E2d7fEeaAD5", "created": 1616245456, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmTcwJX8qLcZrPZ23V5h2ZPP6YcssSoVA5MNvgQLRv5FYu", "voter": "0xb705748859488a8Cb5E39d6d9ad99a83f50F9563", "created": 1616052306, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmSGdo8SY5XEVkXp1SaCRsvZkV3Uy6boD7j1HWvmh25YfC", "voter": "0x08C8CBbD7De24DaEC7b3e65852B42A7d67713349", "created": 1616046042, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
