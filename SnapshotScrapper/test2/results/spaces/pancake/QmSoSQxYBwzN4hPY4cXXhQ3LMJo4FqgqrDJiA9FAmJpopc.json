Have saving accounts in which Cake could be staked for a certain period of time e.g. 30 Days without the possibility of unstaking and be rewarded by a better APY compared to flexible staking.\n\n2. Give stakers and farmers the optionality to harvest directly into those longer term saving accounts. \n\n3. Allocate a % of the farmer rewards into long term saving accounts to align the interests of cakeholders and farmers.\n\n4. Enable selling larger amounts of Syrup by opening a Syrup/Cake farm.\nSellers: Leverage your Cake by selling your Syrup for more Cake and be independent of Syrup pool APYs. This increases your commitment to Pancakeswap as you cannot know at which prices you would be able to buy back Syrup in the future (in order to redeem your Cake) but will lead to potentially better APYs.\nBuyers: Bet on upcoming Syrup pool projects, have more voting power and help locking more Cake. \n\nWhile the proposals 1-3 would shift the point of time at which Cake comes back to the market, the proposal number 4 could create long term staked Cake holdings.\n", "choices": ["Yes to all 4 of them!", "Yes only to proposals 1-3", "None of these"], "start": 1604084400, "end": 1604689200, "snapshot": "1801502", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa13418B892c444C0171a4BD08DDd73Ac0A89694c", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmcbNd51QL4emdfGoXUEmA4fSPmPQ3VDZXeLYLq95LvChH", "voter": "0xeD74b4CBAD71beD8196F21289302B1b4211aBbE1", "created": 1604686606, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmTcyvCEYXKoR2Ur7gokavoYUu9d3kw1A1H7ueZZDCNPiW", "voter": "0xa96cC6E271f0c77C695E0013673831f9DC182fdc", "created": 1604111750, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
