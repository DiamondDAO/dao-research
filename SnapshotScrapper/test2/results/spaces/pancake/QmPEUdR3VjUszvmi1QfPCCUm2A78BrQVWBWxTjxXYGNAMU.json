{"id": "QmPEUdR3VjUszvmi1QfPCCUm2A78BrQVWBWxTjxXYGNAMU", "title": "Substitution of the current CAKE pool for another CAKE pool that does not use SYRUP tokens ", "body": "Since the *SYRUP matter*, the PancakeSwap team had to redo all their plans with this token. That ended up in **reprogramming all the pools** just to stake CAKE to get the determined token *(TWT, BLK, UNFI, etc).*\nIn fact, **not all the pools**, there is an exception: **the CAKE pool**.\n\nThe **current** CAKE pool *(stake CAKE to farm CAKE)* is working in the following way:\n* For every **1 CAKE** staked in the pool, you get **1 SYRUP**, which nowadays is **completely useless**.\n* For every **interaction** with the pool's smart contract, *on average*, you are going to pay **0.0032 BNB** (~ 0.10 USD). It may sound a ridiculous amount, but as long as you stake, unstake and harvest, **it really counts**.\n\nThe other token pools **are no longer** working like before. Currently, they are just programmed to stake CAKE to farm the other token, **without creating or burning SYRUP tokens**. This little difference is playing a huge game here. \n*On average*, you are going to pay **0.0017 BNB** (~ 0.05 USD) for every **interaction** with the pool's smart contract. This means approximately **46 % price difference** between the CAKE pool and the others. You only have to do some maths to calculate how much are all the CAKE pool's users *wasting* every single day.\n\nThis proposal is initiated to ask PancakeSwap team to **erase** the current CAKE pool and to **launch** a new CAKE pool which doesn't use the SYRUP tokens anymore, **a new CAKE pool which works like all the other pools and which saves users' money**.\n\n**And you, do you want to save money?**\nPlease, leave your opinion here. **Every vote counts.**\n", "choices": ["Yes, create a new CAKE pool without SYRUP tokens", "No, do not create a new CAKE pool without SYRUP tokens"], "start": 1607630400, "end": 1607889540, "snapshot": "2986440", "state": "closed", "author": "0xc1a03d3Ea213C37e5A86045fFE95096412534025", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 22, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQFkgGSZtNqd1GvcXNFiZnsg14FVFEZwTSvM6DZsLmAAP", "voter": "0x3D09e0750ec43f954E41204BC49Fc51c881F275B", "created": 1607889360, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "Qmc9mWq85JYz2Ate3AFTmdyct5hpuaribDK71Lh988pggX", "voter": "0x400A7fBCb34072Cbbb6f9391674E86ca07efF107", "created": 1607872444, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmS5SmqyeGzk3CY8DYztc4QeDbDWmSAdjoS5G1uPvPPH9y", "voter": "0xeFA1a4Bb4888e55B91b6dbe70be33cff1BB77ddd", "created": 1607865192, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmexsaaLeoVh4YQnpK2mWkcSFn1KaqqEVku1w8ycgvpsTw", "voter": "0x1C076ced03Fd1D741Ec94d0e1DFa6530CCA0Ae5d", "created": 1607856943, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmZdascFVs2Fh6uZbJXGsAESASPGAWf3Wr6x4TRJ5YFbfY", "voter": "0x53aC2783Dc67C35c67e18E2e37DEed74cfBD7b0A", "created": 1607815811, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmRan2N3JoyLWKBwdwJsKcDCEzrXCJssJgdStsgpsbCkZw", "voter": "0x6924FaAbE6282Ea2a72a3BE263EA0c624c6FE1C3", "created": 1607801167, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmaXWXzhJtnhFmS96hBJQ4UxD29yo8MEPJJjvr7s5d3YzB", "voter": "0xE4FA808b1B55B22292deE5d02A9CEE5618219889", "created": 1607799479, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "Qma6pegfiNjFkJufk5M6XZDGceK8FnrmBPkGW8rdZZ448V", "voter": "0xB463F841388BAcB96293037ddA3b1E0dCAd968c5", "created": 1607789139, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmfCrLvfmjQHfGCCfXQHNyuL8XTyoMVVMtvgqGJaNZfXH5", "voter": "0x73Eca41deb625F68c47cADd0BF73ff4c99d12b7B", "created": 1607786982, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmXmTeLRgfqtDucrzNuHCW6XbSDCJw7CQC69Cj4SJzM19z", "voter": "0x6350De549f70576Aebb93Ff3508c5394b3e9753a", "created": 1607778928, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmS9E4P1usSit7VB8aPAy89138MVNX3qxvDYzdoRvw9CnV", "voter": "0xd3266c767dd8fFe6475De228a9C311CbFA9E749c", "created": 1607778703, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmdPYS5ybrTepNcWekPLcMXBqLzJm7trh8544oDAkYeFXR", "voter": "0xD8c0673Ce77Cc93358Ff5Ac8fD809eB0D5E0479B", "created": 1607769021, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmPu9xbFEWgtoWYvuVzU3dyLc2ptNKgFdBNgBPj5VKxVkz", "voter": "0xe0F966fC88fe9E6C0fACC485d7E734c95Cbc7111", "created": 1607756063, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmYeNqs4Hizm99W7kLfodiHyGz4SSb86566aYiRss1EhRv", "voter": "0x117D9b299e808b171205B10BfCF75f3e8f029582", "created": 1607717631, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "Qme9kRAztvJ1j15k1GUrbVEaV7LyU2go4SUAWHHDwKvtKB", "voter": "0xD1D400a1042E440E52817234f553708c005D6763", "created": 1607690389, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmRMWtCa5NskxP6DD2CLMF2FnSA41aSNmnH3289L346FyP", "voter": "0xdc89245Df6F7DdB58FCC8FD2069e1FBD17e90157", "created": 1607685837, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmZ3zNWu2zR491iCF761a15UigMpuMox4EW2M1roRdtxdP", "voter": "0x34F47BA6795f4b13be9BCdcb13e3C4f4bf29A9E6", "created": 1607662789, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmZ734ujHvLBcaMsT4twFibY9VSwaQhm5PrBNnZU1Y86Mn", "voter": "0x4f401D4b7786B1f9F0E97F9A91656B09F9Dc3C0A", "created": 1607660286, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmQ2gRa37fwXepgTNWCdiyifui286Qbm7ymPbuYFcym84x", "voter": "0xf6F3d4d142f6a0e6241f44A1510Ef9775B513D93", "created": 1607654193, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmZNvxbmjQRAmWkCmjjnTHHN3wq3h7gD9G9CSSzvaCfmd1", "voter": "0xeD4f151015eD5E160F9975700182ccd02a501cC9", "created": 1607637126, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmSRdm4XfYUVTZbKWA9VRsWzzYULbABokxdvriNBEknJBR", "voter": "0xC30A1922D2a97455bD3941451667432405162473", "created": 1607637098, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmaFVcrLrkxC9v7aWu8X8JmpN1ESYGoH1gtyxoVvDhjW99", "voter": "0xc1a03d3Ea213C37e5A86045fFE95096412534025", "created": 1607637090, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
