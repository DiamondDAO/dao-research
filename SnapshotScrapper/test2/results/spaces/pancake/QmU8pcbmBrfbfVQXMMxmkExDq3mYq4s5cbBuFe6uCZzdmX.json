The price of 1 ticket is now way too high. In the next version, 1 ticket will be pegged to $1, and you'll also be able to pick your own numbers etc.\n\nIn addition, we are also proposing to cut the 20,000 CAKE injection that occurs every 2 days, down to 10,000 CAKE.\n\nWhat happens to the other 10,000 CAKE? It will be yeeted into the burn pile each Monday with the rest of it.\n\nIf this proposal is passed, the 10,000 CAKE injection that will occur every 2 days until the next version is ready will be put aside and injected into the first round of the updated lottery as a mega pot (probably 100k CAKE or so).\n\nPlease note - the lottery will be suspended while this proposal is in the voting stage (two lucky people just won, so it's better to pause on a clean slate).", "choices": ["\u2705 Suspend & Burn ", "\u274c Don't suspend & Don't Burn "], "start": 1619621100, "end": 1619707500, "snapshot": "6961053", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6eaf1b33b8672c5dc40aB8f4bA3A0111723126c7", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
