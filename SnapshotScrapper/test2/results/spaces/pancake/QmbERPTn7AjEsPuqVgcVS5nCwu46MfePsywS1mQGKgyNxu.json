{"id": "QmbERPTn7AjEsPuqVgcVS5nCwu46MfePsywS1mQGKgyNxu", "title": "Cake should colonize SOLANA(SOL)", "body": "PancakeSwap really show ethereum it's place by achieving more volume than the entire blockchain. This was only possible with a combination of innovation and low fees in BSC. But now even BSC is showing signs of congestion. Unfortunately, scalability is a critical but unresolved issue in blockchains. Recently, the SOLANA blockchain propose an alternative to proof of stake (POS) and apparently can handle thousands of transactions per second (more than 100X BSC capacity). In this situation, I can see a future when a contender could do to cake the same thing he had done to UniSwap. Become a new project built on previous success and in a cheaper blockchain kicking everyone's ass. Therefore, PancakeSwap can't afford to repeat ethereum dapp's mistakes and sleep in its proud. It need to active search for opportunity in others blockchains not only as a good business but as a protection for future competition. Finally, I propose PancakeSwap should invest in a SOLONA version and use its position to create a foot in this blockchain and go multi-chain.", "choices": ["Yes, do it quickly", "Yes, agree but not a priority", "No, nah we will be fine!"], "start": 1619967600, "end": 1621695600, "snapshot": "7074365", "state": "closed", "author": "0x42E903a7dB318af5F9986c84e78bfB35dD1d3F2A", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXJ49CUxYAX15G2pXJSGnu7TAwmg3ASJNTfUdUM2T8XyH", "voter": "0x9c50774045D55eD0580cF96B5Cc6C539953F2c0C", "created": 1621369638, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmS1Wwh4uE6m6HoJTs43aYQx5NZt5muhgAtYQ2aA4N1jWL", "voter": "0x48f88A8D8e4a9dFF33C0A4D857a81A189C2d6e07", "created": 1620627278, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmepPxNisgFZq1TwuQbCWAmiUwgj2zSkNsd8y4jB7gd3ff", "voter": "0x9404f4B0846A2cD5c659c1edD52BA60abF1F10F4", "created": 1620590980, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmWZz9rgxpyY5LGe8CbeDWZrqrrqeY2LtGMQ6aXEW1mY3Z", "voter": "0x6531caBfF162C82E3DcB5E1aB05d7AB7EC78Df7E", "created": 1620323626, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmQVZrhFvmFr4xLhaxF3evTrhJefAHKji8mVFuAPXUpSJB", "voter": "0x851064900dCB11351e53a39e5aF340E9fC2B7689", "created": 1620275534, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmWe53R4Pe52Z5M7t1dPHtnVrwZweic55Sy7y8nrJfijwB", "voter": "0x60375F10A2Be7d0E75C0E2cD28b073936485D49B", "created": 1620204674, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmXR8zbpPuVq5d8AkCK8qpCBbLLnUpT2NJWmvfWSezT8bP", "voter": "0xceaB40B635c1054d68fab171a6Ea152AEf46EA4E", "created": 1620179652, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmUj5oX6VbVSdy2vkFSWaTtakWXB6vYCvL3ETMJ6swiK6T", "voter": "0xa8Df90cf1D71876AAB307407dFb3471239e4a425", "created": 1620161564, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmWm1BwPYiUmjYM3L6Ri7cQAPgiGYiD7iSQ2Y1WaQDmAVa", "voter": "0x221CFC30A489E9eb2ffB36019a61749Bb3B52cD3", "created": 1620120039, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmYJjqmDmBHuj4YFJFabApYVfRg2jx5BUZGFWXr1QADtuX", "voter": "0x78616b12c44aa3C3D34c19B58E0C53b1AF6c3548", "created": 1620076570, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmfHp61zfpkW827uwLKGY55M365oMWcuSGZUEyKPS7oFnX", "voter": "0x29dF341aC5c09BCFD37F1a16d2E217D668761873", "created": 1619979711, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmduKk97dWD9fpa8YF2YunweMEmN5KrYM3DAt5LwYiCcNM", "voter": "0xc0871A89f710FE26e5f3e66B1ADC1462286fD4A7", "created": 1619972802, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
