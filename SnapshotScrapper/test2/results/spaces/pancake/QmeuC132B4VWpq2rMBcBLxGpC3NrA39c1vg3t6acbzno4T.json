However the sell pressure is still going to be to high with the current structure, what we would like to propose is:\n\nx12 goes towards a BURN/BUYBACK POT which we would decide later how to divide and use it but this POT will help with few things:\n\n1. The lottery will have a bigger impact/effect since there is a constant buyback/burn coming from the x12 so the lottery burn is more significant.\n\n2. Hopefully will help stabilize the CAKE prize more, less sell pressure and buyback to make the prize more stable so more investors wants to join. \n\nCurrently the APYs are still very high compared to other finance pools, and it needs to go down. Either the price will go down and the APYs fall with it, or we find a way to stabilize the price (by lowering the APYs) but not let the price fall with it.\n\nAn example of how we could achieve x12 for a BURN/BUYBACK pot:\n\n- x5 from CAKE-BNB\n- x2 from BUSD-BNB\n- x1 from BAND-BNB\n- x1 from DOT-BNB\n- x1 from LINK-BNB\n- x1 from YFI-BNB \n- x1 from UNI-BNB \n\nSo we lower the rewards according to above, and use this as a BURN/BUYBACK POT. We keep the x60 for farms, hopefully this will help even more to stabilize the price.\n\nIf you like this suggestion please vote YES, if you think its a bad idea please vote NO.", "choices": ["YES", "NO"], "start": 1603875600, "end": 1604008800, "snapshot": "1734824", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3e8734Ec146C981E3eD1f6b582D447DDE701d90c", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZnUED4BFJX2hKFnG6NJ2JtGr3RVvPYAPRFwXJrayePnu", "voter": "0x3D09e0750ec43f954E41204BC49Fc51c881F275B", "created": 1603999593, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmW5Ha3ov8Br57MKWt3cRv6Me623x3aF4gDMkeqcMnQ4j5", "voter": "0xC95c63F14Dc7BDb7d31cC638e2D59d256066ce6b", "created": 1603971734, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmaaeiErjfR7DLCpMKHQr8Sy8h6nDWPJCeCcQQzk2zeido", "voter": "0x192FF39F3722C609EEd087e9bf58E4dd9e5FBb2c", "created": 1603918866, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmTWSJMEAeHHjDG2qo2XResMSt9BjvMBwMTBcbnkA7Kkda", "voter": "0xC772B8b8EFf043aAEB9783B184bB49a121fF1f62", "created": 1603903151, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmTnDpoGPSDMRV7QjVLDK4SAhvjtM1hsQSyUEhsZiuABkw", "voter": "0xE393be3E817802f8807bFd189E8Df88adcE1BfcD", "created": 1603892387, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmYF8VVsr8uqKj7cwui4oFbEAnfabiKJtFAKFPXvDkfryw", "voter": "0x4C2D1b9dEfD2faD17C9a4eb9A050F2C42129bd79", "created": 1603890062, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmWA1s82ZYfjMP8qa3kjL3Eg5gdrGqxTnVTRp5fnr83v2d", "voter": "0x41B67100df10770E93a9EB857AfD48c6dF47D501", "created": 1603889760, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmZ3cUAKQAmpfA4XEo1ayXpjAMkSJPnQpH5Fra4iNmtNL3", "voter": "0x7aE373DF24dAdD7442dd961C950A5f96efBa2035", "created": 1603884821, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmTqYg96UFcuqKQ7bqaYNBQEBDyWnB1sZ55biyxyTgXbzC", "voter": "0xE4C5A7812348bf7A7df078e5203A6ef065e8B952", "created": 1603881651, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmT4eJsiCwGDiDHRgbXWsFVdjrYidZuZo4LuYTcREaaqkV", "voter": "0xBB172929361814c2dB23EC34bbd491eB3779cd29", "created": 1603881105, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmPHFcW2C4xtNCAZVVU9Eg7xirSJyEpV8Eh9BV1XdNneY9", "voter": "0x48f40040Ccb22305Cc79046B153E561096ca10f7", "created": 1603879929, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmedDADyVaK4ycLsFZdn9g1cTgm3P2vwnfC1p4nL3WJZcy", "voter": "0x10E26f3ef5659300866De6942F74923AcdFd3710", "created": 1603878478, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmcWt8omPTH5qEBAuLrmTLiPZZYKBmcRgtzFReLNQZ4zqz", "voter": "0xeE112f066365F444e54838d87C087c489D924DC4", "created": 1603878445, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmS3UYWPfXssTVFjjzV6mVF9s8G9hufnReC85cvd35VyPj", "voter": "0x46fFAB1C0821e44AB50FcFB6bBc5c6ad112b8A57", "created": 1603878304, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmQfj3Kzqtd8U4UJ2YtgEaLt6nCVxAMvud1TXfmgro9YiF", "voter": "0x2bB2E5BaFFc5A8f4aDCDE5EcD2D9Ede42Ad089A3", "created": 1603878301, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmV8PaHTAEywnXMD7dw7PP6rZaB8F4YU92NGaJQbCJ4Kqb", "voter": "0x3e8734Ec146C981E3eD1f6b582D447DDE701d90c", "created": 1603877953, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
