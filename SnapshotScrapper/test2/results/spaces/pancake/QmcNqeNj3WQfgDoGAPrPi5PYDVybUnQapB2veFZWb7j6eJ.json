Any rewards not granted are then subsequently added to the burn pile. So whales can\u2019t come farm coin quickly with hardly any risk and then dump massive CAKE on the market depressing the price. \n\nIf they remove flips before 24hrs they lose 75% of the generated reward amount. Within 48 hours they lose 50%. Within 72hrs 25%, and after a week they can keep all generated rewards. This would affect the harvested amount as well. \n\nThis keeps people being true farms providing real liquidity instead of just chasing yield and hurting the ecosystem.", "choices": ["Add CAKE pairs w/ all current pairs and no lockup on reward harvesting", "Add CAKE pairs w/ all current pairs and lockup period for all rewards harvesting", "Do not add any CAKE pairs but add reward harvesting lockups for all pairs that don\u2019t require CAKE.
