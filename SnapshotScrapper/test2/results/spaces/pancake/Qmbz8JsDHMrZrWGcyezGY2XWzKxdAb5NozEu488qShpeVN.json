What I do now is that i keep 0,0001 LP token unstaked so that I can determine the current price of the LP token through a formula on the liquidity page * current value. \n\nI have 10 different LP tokens staked so it takes some time to determine the current value of my Portfolio. \n\nWhat I suggest is that you can create a dashboard. This Dashboard must be an overview of all my Staked (LP) tokens including the estimated value. I would also like to be able to Harvest on this page so that I don't have to scroll through the entire farm page looking for LP tokens worth to be harvest.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1613041200, "end": 1613300400, "snapshot": "4789968", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb68f3a6fE4f74aAe7c31970dc8E3445E422aB65B", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
