The subsequent lottery draws are essentially moot.\n\nA potential fix to creating more participation may be to:\n1. Change the lottery to once per day - This will create a bigger jackpot with maximum participation\nand/or\n2. Allow for purchase of lottery ticket in tiers of time slots leading up to the lottery drawing with price of the ticket increasing as time nears the drawing.\n\nFor example (Assuming the lottery drawing is once per day):\n- Separate the buying of tickets into four 6 hour time slots (12AM, 6AM, 12PM, and 6PM)\n- All lottery participants who buy tickets from 12AM - 6AM will be able to buy tickets at 70% of total cost (7 CAKE per ticket)\n- All lottery participants who buy tickets from 6AM - 12PM will be able to buy tickets at 80% of total cost (8 CAKE per ticket)\n- All lottery participants who buy tickets from 12PM - 6PM will be able to buy tickets at 90% of total cost (9 CAKE per ticket)\n- All lottery participants who buy tickets from 6PM - 12AM must pay full value of ticket (10 CAKE per ticket)\n\nThis will attract more users to buy tickets early, attracting more users to participate over the course of the day as well as reward early participants in the lottery for increasing the prize pool.", "choices": ["Yes, Implement both Ideas", "Lottery Drawing once per day= Good, Discounted Tickets by purchase time = Bad", "Lottery Drawing once per day= Bad, Discounted Tickets by purchase time = Good", "No, Both Ideas are terrible, Leave it as is"], "start": 1604682000, "end": 1604941200, "snapshot": "1970268", "state": "closed", "author": "0xf86015e1976124c3fdCaf78045632A7fab8e110b", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdFLq2fCtUPNtGWjMvjUFtWaFjty7rVm6EZ4MQy1bMfLr", "voter": "0x2b0F26B19EA343803c3632D1c942dC036835C172", "created": 1604694074, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
