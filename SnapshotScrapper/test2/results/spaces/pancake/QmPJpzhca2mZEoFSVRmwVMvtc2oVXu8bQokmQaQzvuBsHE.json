Currently, the lottery is high risk and I do not believe being used in the most effective way.  However, if done correctly it can be a powerful tool to contribute to the success of the protocol. Here is a suggestion.\n\nWhat is needed is that most people win regularly even if it's not a lot - this will motivate participation on a regular basis. \n\n-Those who get 1 number in any sequence share 15%                                   \n-Those who get 2 numbers in any sequence share 15%                                 \n-Those who get 3 numbers in any sequence share 15%                                 \n-Those who get 4 numbers in any sequence share 15%                                         \n-If anyone gets 4 numbers in the correct sequence they share 20% and no carry-over. If nobody gets 4 numbers in sequence then it carries over to the next pool (4 in the correct sequence will be rare).                                                  \n - 20% burn for every pool /Huge participation / Higher burn = Stability                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                          \nBenefits of this Proposal                                                                                                 -Huge regular participation due to the fact that winning will occur much more often                                                                                                                       -Much higher burning of Cake tokens daily - creating greater stability and balance", "choices": ["Yes, implement this ASAP", "No, do not implement", "Seriously consider with some modifications"], "start": 1603656000, "end": 1603875600, "snapshot": "1660168", "state": "closed", "author": "0xf5C1c668527Cdd22E958c716A5f56084940cb34A", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmfFpKDnZV7ru85GHWQdEwunaZG7VF96FYauU521mJv8vm", "voter": "0xeE4e4940bc57d9BE83d3AEFAC1C2F5A79448EA99", "created": 1603783395, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmUU8GnonKRbgiUMmB8NgRdWTdeYxoqhixNyWY6PRS67m8", "voter": "0xC772B8b8EFf043aAEB9783B184bB49a121fF1f62", "created": 1603769100, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmVkKCrJWwEvCsL5K6btfcUFHBYgncRaBCAZZxHfTBNzgS", "voter": "0x192FF39F3722C609EEd087e9bf58E4dd9e5FBb2c", "created": 1603713266, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmdT7gxTrJYUoKKfAKDvK7Qu1mmN5ET1VDuHWGq16TuMPR", "voter": "0xf5C1c668527Cdd22E958c716A5f56084940cb34A", "created": 1603698801, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmVYHoih63ZXvygRBvf5JSnzi8dzCdgzX3mJLTAnZxwAgT", "voter": "0xab5Ac9cBc4070B3FDcC081dA07898D5d298d9703", "created": 1603692892, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmaNjTzftpqCyTFKZqiipiSgrWJKzWHKoZDMYoMVFonDhp", "voter": "0x056fbE1Cb4200C3C8FCd22123346F1D79B2450EC", "created": 1603679374, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
