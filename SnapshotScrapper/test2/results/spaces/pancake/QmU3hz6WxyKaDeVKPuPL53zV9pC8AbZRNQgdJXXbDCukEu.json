The borrower would pay interest on this which would be paid out to other Syrup stakers.\n\nIf the Syrup collateral goes below a certain price, the borrower would be liquidated. A portion of the liquidated collateral would be burned, contributing to the deflationary mechanisms PancakeSwap is offering.\n\nLending collateral could also be extended to other crypto-assets such as BNB. However, Cake/Syrup should always be a necessary component of lending to promote the use of the token.", "choices": ["Yes, let me borrow money using my Syrup so I can be a degen ", "No, I hate additional APY and deflationary mechanisms"], "start": 1603623600, "end": 1603882800, "snapshot": "1645550", "state": "closed", "author": "0x727DFEC0d79FAf8ca61a678B96aBc9E46E44cfe8", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWMkofuqXnwPo15RsYkjLLSenYzufKgutYGxdfRjnNUZT", "voter": "0xC772B8b8EFf043aAEB9783B184bB49a121fF1f62", "created": 1603772237, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmYE4t3Z8AeWUNtG2YqczXs2MNcszqury3HMg3z61Ka9os", "voter": "0x192FF39F3722C609EEd087e9bf58E4dd9e5FBb2c", "created": 1603713279, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmZvwMFCqiMHYM1esjWPo6WfKCkLuqvfJTxmejwmfCGooa", "voter": "0x727DFEC0d79FAf8ca61a678B96aBc9E46E44cfe8", "created": 1603692219, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
