Even if you don't win, you keep all your deposited funds. Prizes are made up of the interest that accrues on all users deposits. Daily, weekly and even monthly draws could be considered. Deposit into $CAKE prize pool and instantly get tickets. Receive 1 ticket for every $CAKE deposited. When you join the prize pool, your money is deposited into a yield source. The yield source generates the return that makes up the prizes. Once you have entered into the pool you will continue to be eligible for future prizes. You do not need to take any further action. You will be eligible until you withdraw the money you deposited. \nAllocate 50% of the daily interest to the prize, 15% for the weekly draw, and 10% for the monthly draw and yes, burn 25% of the daily interest. We could add $SYRUP corresponding pool to the prize, then, a lucky guy would win cake and the correspondent amount of $TWT, $SXP or $INJ too. For every 1 million cake deposited, currently the daily prize would be around 6,000 cake ( or 3,500 USD). Imagine combining the 20,000 cake lottery incentive every 4 hours.\nThe advantages in this new lottery model, would be: greater quantity of burnt $CAKE, greater participation of the community (after all no one would lose money) and the funds would be deposited more time to compete for the weekly and monthly prizes (taking more liquidity from exchange).\n", "choices": ["Yes, give me more $CAKE", "No, bad idea", "Maybe, but something is missing"], "start": 1603537200, "end": 1603800000, "snapshot": "1650094", "state": "closed", "author": "0x28DEbCF06200a1823FD6C601cc1a70456C2FF084", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmU3bAZmiAa5NPXu86p3FfnUsavKNrXEKVNqDHBu3yZYKf", "voter": "0xC772B8b8EFf043aAEB9783B184bB49a121fF1f62", "created": 1603770831, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmZsGj83do6oDhbxt5zk5TeLS1xm3vkykvYGvnFLqyUtpo", "voter": "0x192FF39F3722C609EEd087e9bf58E4dd9e5FBb2c", "created": 1603713234, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "Qmax2HveRyxodEewaEHmpTs2JaE6qabmZ3MmeG9NFw6hBg", "voter": "0x28DEbCF06200a1823FD6C601cc1a70456C2FF084", "created": 1603625117, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
