Reduce the cost of a lottery ticket from 10 CAKE to 1 CAKE\n2. Reduce the injection from 100k CAKE every 2 days to 20k CAKE every 2 days\n3. Divert the remaining CAKE from the injection to a new initiative and a steadier and more predictable burn\n4. Add a new share of the prize winnings for tickets that match 1 number:\n\n* 50%: matching 4 numbers\n* 20%: matching 3 numbers \n* 10%: matching 2 numbers \n* 5%: matching 1 number \n* 15%: Burn\n\n|  | Current distribution | Proposed distribution |\n|-|-|-|\n| Lottery injection every 2 days | 100k CAKE | 20k CAKE |\n| Mystery New Initiative |  | ~15k CAKE |\n| Burned Weekly |  | ~65k CAKE |\n| Lottery prize distribution | 20%: burn | 15%: burn |\n|  | 50%: matching 4 numbers | 50%: matching 4 numbers |\n|  | 20%: matching 3 numbers | 20%: matching 3 numbers |\n|  | 10%: matching 2 numbers | 10%: matching 2 numbers |\n|  |  | 5%: matching 1 number |      \n\n", "choices": ["Yes let\u2019s burn more CAKE!", " No keep it the same"], "start": 1613069700, "end": 1613091600, "snapshot": "4794587", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6eaf1b33b8672c5dc40aB8f4bA3A0111723126c7", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
