Some may never have tried it due to CAKE price fluctuation , and others like us totally support.\n\nSo how do we bring this forward to the next level is probably in everyone's mind?  The problem so far is \"stability\" of CAKE.\n\nPancakeswap has been breaking records and now as good as Sushiswap on Eth. Because of this, I looked at many Eth YF/Defi projects and found the most stable with a solid business model to this. The project is Harvest finance. Adapting hasn't been Pancakeswap's problem so far , I believe adding what Harvest finance has brought to the space with a gamify flair of Pancakeswap can totally solve the problem and space as well.\n\nMost believe Pancake should be original  how it is fun, gamified , burning dat to day , lottery. I believe it too. \n\nSo drumroll............\n\nFactors considered for Pancakeswap 2.0 -\n\n 1. Keeping the gamify elements that Pancakeswap has\n 2. Golden Syrup idea which opens pools/vaults for longterm staker\n 3. Harvest's ability to automatically farms the highest yield available from the newest DeFi BSC protocol (if community believe it should be crosschain then all protocol)\n\n\nSolution:\n\nStakers of Cake , get syrup , then is able to stake for another coin in the syrup pool as it is now. But with the introduction of the Golden Syrup idea for long term syrup holders. Time limit of how long can be decided. It could be 1 week / 4 week / months. Depending on time staked these Golden syrup pools open.\n\nGolden Syrup pools once opened by stakers , it will allow users to earn more CAKE through it. These pool will have the ability to farm the highest yielding farms across the DEFI scene using Syrup/Golden Syrup. (we could either use the existing syrup or to make it interesting once certain time hits you can stake syrup to get golden syrup)\n\n The percentage of CAKE earned from pools in Golden  syrup will depend on the amount of syrup user stake , how long they've staked for , the price of cake. I believe there would be multiple pools as there might be someone who do have enough syrup but have staked for long time.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn my perspective,  this will definitely create the stability CAKE needs. Miners of CAKE will hold longer term instead of selling it once mined. It will increase demand for CAKE. It keeps the gamified traits that PancakeSwap has. It allows both long term small and big miners fairly. Most of all , it will reward the true Pancakeswap supporters.\n\nI may have found a solution to the problem if open one door which I think is closer to solving it. End of the day, its our to vote , decide , debate then agree. Let's go Pancakeswap's Syrup Lovers!!\n\n\nExtras: \n\nCertain percentage of the CAKE generated from the golden syrup pool are contributed to the Pancakeswap team........we haven't forgotten you guys\n\n", "choices": ["Yes 100% Pancakeswap 2.0 with extras", "Yes 100% Pancakeswap 2.0", "It needs improvement/improvision", "No"], "start": 1603713600, "end": 1604782800, "snapshot": "1664535", "state": "closed", "author": "0x056fbE1Cb4200C3C8FCd22123346F1D79B2450EC", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmbuRF16AD9tzy8ADBPgBTG778dxTXaqfT4ipJ5fX6EtJU", "voter": "0xEAac9EBbdd62c7A7f3D881763dbb23770dEb353B", "created": 1604646319, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmQjooxcoANnnRGDuSRuVpxUrKKkATDidKB8Tv23aqbqvC", "voter": "0x356b5ceb17Df8EbB0CC6Dfa243DAe9Bf57886346", "created": 1604633946, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmPYhJRgdB2ycbC3owz4jW2JefaUZKSE4wLvXQb1eqWpjX", "voter": "0x988BA74a1986A3Be55e2c3ecb2a6257dE934cc86", "created": 1603957291, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmZggi2GRGB1rWhwNLqhmcQb1bUoT1vpmktqj2yPByWzMY", "voter": "0xAd2352C7e53dBACeBff9578a863cCc1FdDeF2FA4", "created": 1603949716, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmTbk3rZQt2YyrbFM94aejbUPe4gMkxbJEVfpXVbFAyakj", "voter": "0xB90f0ed13B8c01ECFB1BeF635a0298094C0D34C7", "created": 1603922637, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmZSNgiroDo8LJ9VZC7Ruw6QZNwh5VF2eDvDinNkua5DER", "voter": "0xEA8Ece03f7b5e2Df4Ff1f489332379e3d0f59121", "created": 1603908533, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmbF6zMNTdf9oFwwNMA7xoNm2UxcUqGimBVnyyNzpKRCM7", "voter": "0xC95c63F14Dc7BDb7d31cC638e2D59d256066ce6b", "created": 1603800781, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmchTZXX8BDvKNnEoTRGfkeGe5MEKNeqEjtuEFVQce5pzh", "voter": "0x2BDdf175FDdAd0955AB0E76ede3562Ec4d0acBA0", "created": 1603798740, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmPM72fMUURedK8YzbNHCicuHB34BtxRUmK8oW4HKF9yGP", "voter": "0xE393be3E817802f8807bFd189E8Df88adcE1BfcD", "created": 1603795567, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmckXSoN2Kb8hiVRSVKUhUsufh4uPA6nXzTxKzbemE4xHX", "voter": "0xC772B8b8EFf043aAEB9783B184bB49a121fF1f62", "created": 1603768106, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmPLzBKVwtfK9czQhs8TGMRWYXFtDxNwZpmmX4q7xV2K6M", "voter": "0xEb5916Ed89b4B8f42E98c3C3C2A360e5eE411d17", "created": 1603766881, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmSWwz3PjsNtknNyqJc6fYszcjdora6tNmLJ9eNKCSHgrh", "voter": "0xFC254740C795C376479170c47FF98164f5338C07", "created": 1603756130, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmbFvq6s6Lcy2UgSUVFXFgLqUgEw3Zxrbe8LArUto7hueS", "voter": "0x05151CB1b6793EA53208cFF91Cd19aBB43D20B83", "created": 1603744854, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmPAfUKniuZwXXBVjrWkHykimvpQgrQMgsrJ5qDB1UHsN5", "voter": "0xdFADf3fD5143a433730E3eC60b546A85357D41d1", "created": 1603733104, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmabtMgv2NyzEEH9ixk8ETrMeYTjSvvwkMtrmLL7Uy95r3", "voter": "0xa3dB05c72c79d52D2D37170A342a2c21c5e5d7C0", "created": 1603723382, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmdQ447bPMoivSsWpQB9svHzCmZMZzBweoGPujizs1h9b6", "voter": "0xb7da6b76d150b9fAC8f38F5056B7011F47C52825", "created": 1603720615, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
