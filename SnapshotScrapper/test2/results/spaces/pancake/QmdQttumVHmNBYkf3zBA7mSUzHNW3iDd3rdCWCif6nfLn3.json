These NFTs can have a bonus of being used for staking and applying multiplier rewards to that pool. \n\nBy doing so you would:\n- Get more interests in partnerships with Pancakeswap, as having an NFT made for your project is great marketing\n- Provide users more opportunities to collect amazing Pancakeswap artwork (I'd imagine the partner would pay a premium to have this kind of deal made, which would cover the artist costs)\n- Gamify the platform more by providing \"equips\" of sorts that give bonuses to the farming experience\n- Open interest in an NFT trading marketplace for Pancakeswap users as people would want to buy, trade, or sell NFTs tied to specific partnerships or pools for those that originally missed out on the NFT but would like the bonus farm for using that pool", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1615395600, "end": 1615996800, "snapshot": "5560242", "state": "closed", "author": "0xBe624aa104B4b1A0d634ddB6c15358f56DCfF111", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVPWKD9z7zZkQfVeJrJRJLuShfq2c7UZQAfns27prouzX", "voter": "0x316deF3E4F3b610833844658Bb5cC08B74eE16af", "created": 1615996288, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmcMvYTqTUUG3Z9476nRHJ2Dxuy2Y65MWMGCNRMfW2Q3kL", "voter": "0xB1FfC7c147a8AF95767f963BA039D4f934E4AaA8", "created": 1615992105, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "Qmcd7CQrJRDzigdyR2uQsh98mL162oHrAi1CWHNpUxHabc", "voter": "0x4FAcEb3eC6a2Da04710e0540b8597C824a41edBD", "created": 1615639765, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmP2yEzDw9xksZzTm6BctHvSJjYZwEXopv34ZBAJfUrU34", "voter": "0x6cC91aC00B7014C73a994AC705186b54e729a386", "created": 1615590602, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmXMUhviggaqhXRzjwLoWDyAaiTRYpYBN1Z7vRiiafz2Th", "voter": "0xab9edE4A56c3f368A3700c02F2091e93594c5605", "created": 1615588681, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "Qmc2ZXZKrddRrKLyCrAbjoXCdVj1e52Xo9CZTvNTSktGCC", "voter": "0xfA6d381160B381b16B3035954EA0D9a40E0961b4", "created": 1615587355, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "Qmf7zuNdw2KRePU7cXEsNChqDowA1RdwbUi8xJawQysPQL", "voter": "0xb705748859488a8Cb5E39d6d9ad99a83f50F9563", "created": 1615544113, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmcGUNq2W3oggyenTv5Nf4BzaooM23noJp4SBsWYxyrfCK", "voter": "0x869A16bF321295bc39b308893AE038ed7c11B805", "created": 1615529761, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmY1CKGkN5ZFisoSG1PDy2NEdU3Ko31szkLKho4hwz3chn", "voter": "0xc04C7B2DB97dAAD349E69B2dC94CA4C8962F65ea", "created": 1615510360, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmZg8rzKw8ctxZv5hhJgSXHmmyRj1PRzLhvwkXkJuJDoGd", "voter": "0xaD45A548b9C779eF5a2b6466c54955b183D8555F", "created": 1615422144, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
