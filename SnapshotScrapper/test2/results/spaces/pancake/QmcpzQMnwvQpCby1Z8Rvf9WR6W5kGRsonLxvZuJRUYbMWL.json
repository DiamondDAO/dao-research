We can never build up a long-term view without short-term actions. This is reflected that the demand of $Cake reduced which cause both price and TVL went down after APY of farming reduced by almost by 50%.\n\nDaily emissions reduction does not help if demand of $Cake is not getting higher. To solve this issue, I am proposing to increase the demand of $Cake by the following suggestion.\n\n\n- Take 10-20% from the $Cake daily burned and use it for airdrop to every $Cake or $Syrup holders. Daily snapshot to see how many $Cake the holders own and give the according number of $Cake per month.\n\n\nConcept of the above suggestion:\n1) WINWIN - both $Cake and $Cake investors\n2) Attracts more investment from internal and external\n3) Maintain loyalty of holding $Cake\n4) Solve the price issue in short-term and bring more time to the team for more long-term measures\n\nNow, please make your vote!", "choices": ["Yes, I always want more $Cake", "No, I don't want my wallet filled"], "start": 1604062800, "end": 1604159940, "snapshot": "1791463", "state": "closed", "author": "0xdB9D2816Aee1732C968703512A8E55d8Ec7805A1", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmaHVwDmYq11WXSHfwdKvotsDEHfNNqgDF6gsBufTGonwk", "voter": "0xdB9D2816Aee1732C968703512A8E55d8Ec7805A1", "created": 1604071008, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
