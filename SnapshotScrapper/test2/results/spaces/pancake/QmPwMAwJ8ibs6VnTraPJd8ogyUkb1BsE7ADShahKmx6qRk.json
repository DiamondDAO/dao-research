NO, it hurts IFO projects, Why? because $CAKE burned has no impact on their project\n\nTherefore, I propose a new option which hopefully will benefit both parties and increase the interest of new potential projects to launch their IFO on PancakeSwap.\n\n\nThis is my proposal:\n50% of funds raised in IFO \"in $ CAKE\", will be available in liquidity of $CAKE - $IFO (a IFO project token) trading pair.\n\n* In this option, projects that want to launch IFO are required to provide a number of their project tokens to be placed in liquidity later, and it will pair with $CAKE (worth of 50% of the funds raised in their IFO).\n* the $CAKE - $IFO LP must be burned to ensure that it will always be available, and no one can access it\n\nThis option has several advantages and disadvantages for our community, that is\n\nAdvantages:\n1. attracted more interest from projects to launch their IFO\n2. promotes $ CAKE to become a major pair in trading liquidity especially for IFO projects\n3. good impact if $CAKE - $IFO liquidity providers grow (example, if IFO projects create rewards events for $CAKE - $IFO (a project token) liquidity providers (LP's).\n\n\n*. 50% of the funds raised in IFO \"in $CAKE\" will still reduce the $CAKE circulating supply, because $CAKE - $IFO LP will be burned (however the $CAKE amount locked in LP can change any time, depending on the situation of the $ CAKE - $ IFO trading pair\n\n\nA disadvantage:\n1. amount of $CAKE locked in burned $CAKE - $IFO LP (from 50% of funds raised in IFO) can fall if dumped in $IFO token price (in $CAKE trading pair), and that amount of $CAKE will return to circulating supply, so the team must be more selective in allowing projects that will launch IFO", "choices": ["YES.!", "NO.!"], "start": 1616907600, "end": 1617598800, "snapshot": "6069585", "state": "closed", "author": "0x576e3016f20c5218886d0B74CB71a41b5A15351C", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmf6ZXPYZ5zNbyHqFosDZvy3f7bQFG1smLBmLyiZ6DTbnZ", "voter": "0xFf074d7Dd14094538AD5AeE25055AAD04401ce9f", "created": 1617549377, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmRY4Lzo8n7kzGZAKrAz18aKc5JkZi3MK2RMPbyAJMyTML", "voter": "0x8DB1A32db538AB74dFAd4e2B341aF5AF658126F4", "created": 1617368514, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmRTvDkcMtqyUQLGCq63EcJUdswm9B2sYi3xLtZN4Hy1Yh", "voter": "0xe57FE7A0F2B37bf36810F4Bd14e67b12f5B96E18", "created": 1617157567, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmbgNoSdJVrcvpzTUoh4L5285g3mQ5aRXDvBuDzac9fDYt", "voter": "0x65B4F48B8Fe77C778cFCC5A999E95cAB06453857", "created": 1616936220, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
