Inject 3/4 directly into lottery and divert the other 1/4 to a \u201cprogressive\u201d jackpot. \n\nOnce X amount of CAKE is staked into that address, then divert 1/2 of the injection to the progressive address and so forth and so on until all the CAKE goes into staking and only what is generated from staking feeds the jackpot.\n\nThen it\u2019s like burning a lot more cake then you are burning now.", "choices": ["Yes I agree on this", "No I do not agree on this"], "start": 1603980900, "end": 1604609940, "snapshot": "1769459", "state": "closed", "author": "0x41B67100df10770E93a9EB857AfD48c6dF47D501", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUPVze4APTCGRNzkoySaQwpBsvzpTiGRXdCtkuR6ttvc7", "voter": "0x3D09e0750ec43f954E41204BC49Fc51c881F275B", "created": 1603999548, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
