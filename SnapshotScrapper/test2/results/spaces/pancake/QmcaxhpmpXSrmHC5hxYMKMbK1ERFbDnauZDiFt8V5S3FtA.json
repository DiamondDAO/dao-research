(still burning the Cake part of the Cake-BNB LP tokens in the process)\n4: 90% reserved for the lottery.\n5: Remaining 10% shared equally amongst the non-IFO lottery winners. \n\nThis gives us an incentive to lock 100 LP's, in case your account wins the lottery, thus preventing a mass lock of 1 LP per  account. It also ensures accounts that can only afford to lock 1 LP will get disproportionally more of the new IFO token. Thus looking after the every day PCS user. \n\nFurther more it defacto locks a non-insignificant amount of Cake-BNB tokens for a rolling 3 month period, decreasing the amount of cakes in circulation. \nI see this as a win-win solution.", "choices": ["90% / 10% IFO allocation.", "80 / 20% IFO allocation", "keep the current system"], "start": 1615374000, "end": 1615719600, "snapshot": "5554449", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB8eb90D8911F278EBdf953F7dc2F778B1C4a1057", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmcYj2CYA3r59UdZ28w8CF7kGxDUM2FwhJrc3f5H8eex9S", "voter": "0x4FAcEb3eC6a2Da04710e0540b8597C824a41edBD", "created": 1615640093, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmfYFGVQvff9p2rMGQiimKCJt2jui2uRDKzRjARc1kzHDs", "voter": "0xB8eb90D8911F278EBdf953F7dc2F778B1C4a1057", "created": 1615590227, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmdowoTLwamMzayLuAZkHjNszZG3ns5Es8qyHcHR1Qj2ne", "voter": "0xab9edE4A56c3f368A3700c02F2091e93594c5605", "created": 1615588453, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmVDkSefBP6s6VsVhdi5u354DPRpEbMNHQurz8rYc437YA", "voter": "0xfA6d381160B381b16B3035954EA0D9a40E0961b4", "created": 1615587412, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmaFa2e8Dwmxe43MJu1E6x5yaFfT9rWoFhESwC8ggS8TEn", "voter": "0xc04C7B2DB97dAAD349E69B2dC94CA4C8962F65ea", "created": 1615513045, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmcWUWTsfhQChGA9ZmKJ4453VwsRPkraKC6ZNfaDiwg2eX", "voter": "0xaD45A548b9C779eF5a2b6466c54955b183D8555F", "created": 1615422702, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
