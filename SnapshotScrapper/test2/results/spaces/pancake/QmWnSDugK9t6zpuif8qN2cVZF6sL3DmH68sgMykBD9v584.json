Others sell off their cake to make quick profits, which lowers the price. Those who hold, create a floor for the price, and provide liquidity and stability. That should be rewarded, because it's positive for the project. \n\nCurrently, the rewards system does not differentiate between holders, and sellers. I propose that a separation be made. I propose to reward those who hold, and to incentivise those who sell to become holders.\n\nOne way of accomplishing this, is by separating the syrup pool into pools for those who hold, and those who sell. If you have been holding for 1 month for example, you get access to a holder pool. This holder pool would likely have less people in it, which would translate to a higher APY. Sellers will then start holding in order to gain access to the higher APY pools, which would improve price action. The sellers pool APY can never be allowed to be more than the holder pools, in order to maintain the I incentive. \n\nThis is just an example. The requirements to qualify for the holder pool could also be based on Block time. It could be in days, or weeks, or months. There could even be multiple tiers of pools. For example, pools for less than 1 month. Pools for 1 month or more. And pools for over 3 months. The implementation details are up to the chefs. \n\nFor liquidity pools, my proposal is similar. Create different pools for holders.
