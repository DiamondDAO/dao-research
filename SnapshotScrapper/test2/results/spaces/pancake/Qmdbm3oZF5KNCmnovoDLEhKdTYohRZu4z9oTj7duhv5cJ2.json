Myself and most likely many others are using CAKE in diffrent yield farming aggregators so when there is a voting we still want to be part of it.\n\nRight now if we are using yield aggregators we will miss the snapshots and not be able to take part of the voting with our full power.\n\nI am not sure how this would work from a development standpoint but would be nice if community and team can bring up some ideas in this direction. I think it would be important to have the full community being able to vote with their true CAKE value instead of only the users who keep their CAKE in the syrup pool.\n\nFor example PancakeBunny, for those that keep CAKE in their plattform cannot take part in the voting. Currently its 255m$ locked in CAKE/CAKE-BNB value there which is a big part of voters. \n\nAutofarm-network and other farms also have a big volume of CAKE users who most likely would be happy to participate in votings but cannot because of the cost to unstake/stake and also going to miss the snapshots.\n\nThanks", "choices": ["Create vCAKE token", "Not create vCAKE token"], "start": 1616065200, "end": 1616238000, "snapshot": "5798596", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3e8734Ec146C981E3eD1f6b582D447DDE701d90c", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNsyu3dMrCzkKoHxJFFzaXuxQXWX5turSSrWcNyDXAHFg", "voter": "0x3e8734Ec146C981E3eD1f6b582D447DDE701d90c", "created": 1616102632, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
