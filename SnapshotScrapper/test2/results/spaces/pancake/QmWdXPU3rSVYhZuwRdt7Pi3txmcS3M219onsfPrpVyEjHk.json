Bigger Pot, bigger burns.\n\nIdea:\nGive possibility to buy lottery tickets with other BEP20 Tokens that are on pancakeswap. For example Frank just has BEP20-BNB as he is new to this stuff. But he wants to play the new lottery. He should be able to buy a ticket with his BNB directly. \nHow? If Frank chooses to buy a ticket with BNB, the form calculates the amount of BNB equal to 10 CAKE (just like swapping to 10 CAKE manually). If Frank now buys the ticket, his BNB is swapped for CAKE through the exchange in the background and that CAKE gets injected in the lottery pot. So the pool is only CAKE. This just eliminates an extra step, thus making it newcomer friendly. So the lottery would still be exactly the same, but opened to more Buy Tokens, meaning bigger pots and more burn of CAKE.\n\nBonus:\nTo further reward people that buy directly with CAKE, other Tokens could iE pay the equivalent of 11 CAKE, so that CAKE effectivly has a discount on tickets.\n\nBonus-Bonus:\nCould put up an extra website just for the lottery front-end, which runs the same backend lottery as on pancakeswap.finance. This could be marketed even more. Lottery on pancake would stay of course. But this front-end could be integrated on other websites as a \"plug-in\". Could make the pots bigger, as we generate more traffic.\n\n", "choices": ["YES, buy tickets with other tokens!", "NO, just with CAKE and swap manually"], "start": 1604055600, "end": 1604660400, "snapshot": "1793082", "state": "closed", "author": "0xD13642A3c0338543E6ea8bB34aECbd603da93bcb", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRd1x73vMMeAoqdQfLRvKsoCcc33XmTbnzbo87sN8uQV7", "voter": "0x28DEbCF06200a1823FD6C601cc1a70456C2FF084", "created": 1604067285, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmY2r2MuXBKhfVUyUr3VsHfvQXfRGpriZZrkYsDLcnHxu5", "voter": "0xa96cC6E271f0c77C695E0013673831f9DC182fdc", "created": 1604063484, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmbQFEPuqPBCctDKgYPnrAnSTJCACqxhCnsqMDm5k32LRy", "voter": "0x353ecF483eE3EB90dF55E684084528dca919c748", "created": 1604056337, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmbE28DE6mLq9h33UL6LVViuE5nsy9AfY36c367XAysdPf", "voter": "0x41B67100df10770E93a9EB857AfD48c6dF47D501", "created": 1604056165, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
