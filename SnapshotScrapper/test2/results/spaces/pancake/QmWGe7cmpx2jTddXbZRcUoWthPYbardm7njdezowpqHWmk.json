The 4 in the correct order will still exist - that is the cherry on the cake. Everyone else should win at least 10 or 20% of the time. From the pool, 20 - 40% should be burned. If you win often then you will participate more and the pools will be larger ---the other main reason is to burn Cake for sustainability. So the lottery becomes a tool to burn and sustain and at the same time produce big lucky winners and lots of smaller winners.
