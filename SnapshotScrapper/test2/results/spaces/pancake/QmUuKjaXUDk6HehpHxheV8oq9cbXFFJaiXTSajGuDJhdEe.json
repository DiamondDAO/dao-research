To keep up the momentum to grow our community and ultimately having more Fancake/Liquidity Provider/Cake holder/Swapper, we need to explore ways to grow inorganically.\n\nThis is very important as the growth rate in our Telegram group has plateaued. From early Oct we added 300-800 new members per day but as of end Oct we are only adding 100+ members. \n\nSource: https://combot.org/c/1230885703/a\n\nLet's together think of ways to grow our reach new audiences.\nSome of the ideas I can think of:-\n1. YouTube video competition to introduce to people about PCS. Reward criteria - The number of likes & views\n2. Medium article to say what they like and dislike about PCS. Reward criteria - The number of claps\n3. Tweets about PCS. Reward criteria - Number of like and retweet\n\nFeel free to create new proposal and link to this if you have better idea to grow the community.", "choices": ["YouTube video competition to introduce to people about PCS", "Medium article to say what they like and dislike about PCS", "Tweets about PCS", "We do not need inorganic growth"], "start": 1603944000, "end": 1604246340, "snapshot": "1771965", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6ef7A347fEb742be14Bb206B644De487fb4B1433", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
