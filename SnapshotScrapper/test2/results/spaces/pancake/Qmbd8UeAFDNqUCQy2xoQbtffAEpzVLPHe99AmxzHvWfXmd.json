If a farm's liquidity is below a certain amount or if the volume of that trading pair is below a certain amount for a month (or some peroid of time), then that farm should be removed.\n\nThere are a few farms with 200-300% APR with liquidity around $500,000 or less and very little 24 hour trade volume. Although these farms have a small multiplier, they could be completely removed. \n\nAs a result, the CAKE per block originally going to these farms could either be reallocated to other farms, burned, added to the lottery, or used as part of the profile rewards/NFT gamification which could be later voted on.", "choices": ["Yes remove small farms.", "No, leave farms as is."], "start": 1615575600, "end": 1616004000, "snapshot": "5604378", "state": "closed", "author": "0xFe1070a7676Eb012e11B544d57a08a46D6Aa4F2b", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXc3mPNUtoEZcAPFcVgTiUh65WH2bYtufaCzx7d3LHBiR", "voter": "0x475b6ff6603F17177B7E419d1aD2791fb82a3a56", "created": 1615997244, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmRvHn3E5gC7jJtVN9PfufWZYCUQ9yd55mJxnzeLyEwvR5", "voter": "0x4FAcEb3eC6a2Da04710e0540b8597C824a41edBD", "created": 1615639759, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "Qmea2oWrdGJSZzthDgDxGagL7SG2QB7q7o6TEyPUdHTBtG", "voter": "0x6cC91aC00B7014C73a994AC705186b54e729a386", "created": 1615590523, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmPBTvqDggU2T2e3Kk5ZQ1V7yPaKpBNoPb4HHmLCLERNR7", "voter": "0xB8eb90D8911F278EBdf953F7dc2F778B1C4a1057", "created": 1615590414, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
