Since it dilutes rewards, the chefs want BSC\u2019s greatest community to make the decision themselves.\n", "choices": ["Yes we want that boost", "No we dont want the boost"], "start": 1619056800, "end": 1619143200, "snapshot": "6781436", "state": "closed", "author": "0x810d30b20Dbbe59A24a6bEc0A511d8eC4e802D35", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYLKSqMXUp7qiaCezYQhUUdTth2QUYn1MRiMiXD5DD5wC", "voter": "0x69f46cacc6bD922DD7b5ca07Db22858F52a5EB1A", "created": 1619140212, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmNyFzGPfXev4sW71qJ3KQRgoPeUZNZnsCNsBQJqM5hhzU", "voter": "0xB17597E905F3550E280Ba90697C84c5c94FDd134", "created": 1619110578, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmY7hPrxKmb24xRDEkA4LARnPbL95qP37wbYcoauxQVoxd", "voter": "0xf410A80F53CAe2B938A402583a48206AEA9FA490", "created": 1619108004, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
