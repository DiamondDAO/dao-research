Full amount if transferred to the following lottery. \n\nRewards:\n-Add a 1 month \"locked\" period for lottery winnings.\n-During the locked period, allow for the lottery winnings to only be fully or partially used for the purchasing of lottery tickets. \n\nAll of these changes will combine to reduce gas fees, increase CAKE burn rate, incentivize people with low liquidity to participate in the lottery, promote lottery winners to continue participating (through the locking system allowing for lottery participation only), increase the likelihood of larger lottery winnings (due to lesser chances of winning with 2/3 matching numbers), and will prevent dumping by lottery winners through the lock period. \n", "choices": ["Yes, make changes as shown", "No, leave lottery system as it is"], "start": 1604073600, "end": 1604764800, "snapshot": "1745115", "state": "closed", "author": "0xD9d3dd56936F90ea4c7677F554dfEFD45eF6Df0F", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWFVBDCjPB3AUZG8cj1N2UHB3uX6zKVTaNP1SVcFGvfB6", "voter": "0xeD74b4CBAD71beD8196F21289302B1b4211aBbE1", "created": 1604686784, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmZjR6R76CRgZPX6b3aUHqUh8D87YQbemWLTn9jRFfmha3", "voter": "0xD9d3dd56936F90ea4c7677F554dfEFD45eF6Df0F", "created": 1604076692, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
