These CAKE tokens will be automatically staked and invested in Syrup pool for tokens. The earnings from staking will be distributed to the winner either daily or hourly converted to CAKE. The number of cake tokens you have staked in the Lottery Pool will determine your winning probability. e.g. 10 Cakes staked gives you 1 ticket which will be drawn against. e.g. if you have 1000 CAKES staking , you will get 100 tickets. You dont lose the tickets after every drawing. you are still in play till you keep your CAKE staked.
