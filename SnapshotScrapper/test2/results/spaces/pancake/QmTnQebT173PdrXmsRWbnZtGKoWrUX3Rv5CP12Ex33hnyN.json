Let's farm!\n\nFour months ago, Wise token successfully launched on Ethereum, and currently boasts a $300 million+ liquidity pool on Uniswap and about 10,000 users. Now on BSC, with a BEP20 version of Wise, \"WISB\" tokens have the same innovative features as the original token on Ethereum as well as some important upgrades:\n\nBNB Airdrops: Wallets staking WISB for 365 days or longer will receive weekly ongoing airdrops in BNB. The revenue for this is generated from lending out the massive liquidity formed in the presale.\n\nReduced Impermanent Loss: WISB/BNB liquidity pairs have significantly reduced impermanent loss because their price is correlated (you can already see this concept in action on WISE/ETH LP on Uniswap and Quickswap). This makes WISB the premier LP token to have on BSC.\n\nLending WISB: In addition to regular staking and LP farming on Pancakeswap (this proposal) and other partner DEXs, WISB tokens can be lent to the \"Reserve Pool\" which is a profits sharing pool where holders can earn a slice of the entire ecosystem's profits. This becomes especially interesting considering the profits generated by the system are bound to skyrocket once the Lending/Borrowing contract is deployed later this year.\n\nWISB token is the ethical standard for all DeFi projects. It is a fairly launched, fairly distributed, fully decentralized, audited, crypto-backed and highly liquid asset.\n\nFairly launched - No parties received free tokens or discounted tokens, not even the founder/team.\n\nFairly distributed - Everyone paid fair market price to obtain WISB.\n\nFully Decentralized - 100% automated by smart contracts with no admin keys.\n\nAudited - By CoinFabrik https://wisetoken.net/Wise_Audit_Report.pdf (The WISE team also ran a $50,000 bug bounty for the community to double check the code before launching.\n\nBNB-backed - 100% value of the BNB raised in the presale goes straight into the Pancakeswap pair, which is then locked forever by burning the LP tokens.\n\nHighly liquid - Massive liquidity allows investors to buy more without moving the price against themselves. All successful markets need massive liquidity in order to reach a large market cap and this is part of the long term WISB strategy.\n\nWISB is one of the safest assets you can hold in the entire BSC ecosystem and also the only system that shares 100% of profits with its holders. Wise token was designed to be the most efficient DeFi ecosystem ever made, and we believe that focusing all profits back to users gives us a massive competitive advantage versus the traditional corporate-style business models. Wise token was created by the community and for the community, and we invite you to become part of our amazing group!\n\nProposed CAKE emissions rate: $150% APY\n\nThank you,\nWise Token Team", "choices": ["Yes, WISB/BNB Farm", "No, WISB/BNB Farm"], "start": 1623873600, "end": 1624564800, "snapshot": "8115045", "state": "closed", "author": "0x8268474c4eA48e405B2e778305a7716c7DF1fddF", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 23, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmX3i5sWadRzA7nXxWYUpVYbF6Xmy1UUoknUqHnD7d4Mut", "voter": "0xa117E7Cd8D4aa9d3A5EEA4a5EE397fb920c2F7D4", "created": 1624313950, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "Qmabbq8QoJ1RNeRbAfp86vGvdMQDs116Mme67B8LUug59F", "voter": "0x0658A9CF582220E18491c230f8Ac3c5Ffdbde35e", "created": 1624098216, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmT3A6WZkCkJV7Aixx2Yu9fng56YYKw7XM2y8rJcKeYRV8", "voter": "0x05e72266A449D607b45374ff3b3F61Da7c3aDab2", "created": 1624054303, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmcMxN6EzPXcXrqE8354n6gjAN5audWDyrDy9kSxThbDMi", "voter": "0x44a4B0f51fd0832410039ec6A052f219faAD434b", "created": 1623964646, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmfPgt89cowgadSB556iCp67KSZdZdxKCxP3go6rR72tnH", "voter": "0xb76346445FEE93BeA1dEF4f8279b80Cb07d44a57", "created": 1623950002, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmUC3RhDkW2vhnwWce7Q9JE4q7GE1xRYDhoyMM1JqXmT5P", "voter": "0x52C34872a9e1d22b4F54D3969F920C4BF1E06088", "created": 1623948263, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmcJfLmNXNounZJyCo7YEg7MecLHncENejctiJzcEXccYL", "voter": "0xb45C27573981451158238AFd22B2C539555B5F60", "created": 1623935461, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmeHWXfA224fF9rHz5i1bQ9nf8vyvE4JRihHNHCqT9JBtM", "voter": "0xbD5Dd277f9EC531c6B4cF63D2560170c8067D30B", "created": 1623935421, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmcmmJq77sycyc2CGcG9CVkPoxacghA8PoFo7TjQtDtrHe", "voter": "0xbE621D45D0597f58C7D46262758F1ef7E4A74d92", "created": 1623935407, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmY9B2kKzVHLSpyEKffijbi37NWP5ct8r1Avcdk6jPQBSg", "voter": "0x5A81Aa745c9E9aEdDA90280152c30AC9ecbC4aF6", "created": 1623935392, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmRFxeUwH7ZotcCSCy1RkysBSvrpEeUP9Ycmqor2YYzKja", "voter": "0xC6d08573D2c087deB6EdD1EB60e071E1Ef02f56F", "created": 1623935372, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmWiABbxm1QPvtvxvocrPVCKfTEu3VecmsBHaGWFhZr47J", "voter": "0xc637be0B9cFeA73297B0856E40570810Ff24C15F", "created": 1623935346, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmUZaexSk1seVkyw3JpVqHUBzr6wUUG3ajWWMyK4FLFBvW", "voter": "0xe552ce26cC5B7a893311432Ec38ED1A9f2D648A0", "created": 1623935333, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmP4tU7giihnViKBC4YyDHZ7fBiYmcipnxLvUkuScDfy3x", "voter": "0xA2bf10F0B951833Ed7782893C635612d573E2C72", "created": 1623935322, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmQ3iMoNLjL2SgM6ceH1eZ7aMf9HsY2LZKcTY6waEtrHex", "voter": "0x0b0aE09Ddd1eDF4083Fb5862f88A8cf72e97f189", "created": 1623935225, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmXrdGcuQ3KuoE35wASBCDRBfU7ctUzZAjrTxcAjA6jPos", "voter": "0x4A40B48Cb0ba49B38fA5C239890c144Fac4CD17B", "created": 1623935210, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "Qmd53CzSLXSXMk7ZTMPNbo83qqnUkuhUeGdw5zJUh4SBC5", "voter": "0x1D07cA009D9E507E780FD921d63C90c2bCD1052c", "created": 1623935142, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmQTyCXGY2LFoMuSckrqUZHoW31VRSAZnwWh4gJcgnNcKu", "voter": "0xd498B7AF967ACb1893E86726Bb7855232739215e", "created": 1623935101, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmTRjQ8eVdaxiGq3Gp58GUVtmnUbSY8FwpsKY9Gh8btWUk", "voter": "0xA4DC2788bCc832095bBa2B148a5D98D0dCA270a6", "created": 1623935090, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmPvDtwNH1acvRB8gQ1SMLxG5Dpkkoe7g29YCywpEuokfv", "voter": "0x7DAe7d51c20EA1DC6E11A6ab4672C4F835098aae", "created": 1623928908, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmRQJzWXh5LjRAi8dbCJsSrmA89VaW85D1yKgg3QHHUwNA", "voter": "0xD1570080bcB784b4F5E378dfd4cDfFDfd6C110f6", "created": 1623907194, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmdEDz9zVoLeDxUEvFKJvzWZwSjgxc44iHrfg927snKRQf", "voter": "0x8b017905DC96B38f817473dc885F84D4C76bC113", "created": 1623899230, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmaBrns1VCRVhUM8T8cqbEuvzb2BkAyJnc5J1D8wSdLiVA", "voter": "0x06c4865ab16c9C760622f19a313a2E637E2e66a2", "created": 1623892592, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
