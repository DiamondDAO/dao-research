Considering there is 700mil volume  being traded every day on the platform with a market cap of 1.56bil (vs Sushi Swap 289mil volume - which is valued at a 2.7bil valuation; and UniSwap 969mil volume - which is valued at 17bil), the PancakeSwap Coin should be valued far higher. However, in comparison to these coins, we have no max number of coins whilst UniSwap and Sushi Swap are capped.   \n\nWhy you should do this:\n1. Following Bitcoin's price action during times of the halvening, there have been drastic increases in price. \n2. Preserve the value of Pancake Swap. \n3. Compete with the likes of UniSwap and SushiSwap. By placing us in the top 20 coins will provide us far more social media traction and increase the respectability and reputability of the platform. \n4. Promote scarcity of Pancake Swap token. \n\nWhy you should not do this:\n1. APYs will naturally decrease because the inflationary mechanism of cake pumps up the APY received. I.e. There will be a reduction in the amount of newly minted Pancake Swap tokens to distribute to liquidity providers.\n\nThanks", "choices": ["Have a halvening every 3 months", "Have a 'quartening' every3months", "Continue the mechanism as it is"], "start": 1615590000, "end": 1616288400, "snapshot": "5642703", "state": "closed", "author": "0xF4E00f6Ff3EAaA929ae76ea023D0074EAFBF9602", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQCRn1ARLgzzt3VL1vGjMnh7TZ59yrUtAunicMHDn1cqU", "voter": "0xb6E34A8A93031a24C264Be59D0BaC00bcaeF9051", "created": 1616287502, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmUkPsL1QkSZoNtjq1KWZgkkSELhDJCRtAbHrg5wcf8zPT", "voter": "0x08C8CBbD7De24DaEC7b3e65852B42A7d67713349", "created": 1616046111, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmNn38xZNYj2GMxjFiaeBQrGCnbsBj9oN36iZM44rJ778r", "voter": "0x2409226a581870A929109315E9399D03168bE31D", "created": 1616000526, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmQW5bExCts8eCvcqLyyXmqa4QfHasV9FYkQokgZrXhPVZ", "voter": "0xdC7Ad433381CA968510742fA5730d68E9e162AE8", "created": 1615658231, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
