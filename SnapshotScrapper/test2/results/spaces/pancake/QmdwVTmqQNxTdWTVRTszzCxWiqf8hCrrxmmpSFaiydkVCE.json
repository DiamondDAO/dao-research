{"id": "QmdwVTmqQNxTdWTVRTszzCxWiqf8hCrrxmmpSFaiydkVCE", "title": "More ALT-CAKE LP farms", "body": "A lot of cakers want to hold cake and altcoins. For the moment they can't. They have to sell their cakes to buy BNB and farms ALT-BNB. Someone who just want to farm BTC and CAKE  for example can't do it. He has to sell some CAKE to buy BNB too.\n\nI propose to create ALT-CAKE pair for each ALT-BNB pools. People will have the choice to provide liquidity in ALT and CAKE or in ALT-BNB.\n\nWhy is that good for Pancakeswap ?\n\n1) People can access to altcoins farms without having to sell their CAKE for BNB.\n\n2) More trading opportunities = more fees\n\n3) Bring CAKE to an other level. When you are on Binance, you have to use BNB. Now that Pancakeswap becomes bigger, it's time to be a little more independant and use CAKE instead of BNB. I love BNB when I'm using it on Binance as I love CAKE when I'm using it on Pancakeswap. This will also mean more decentralization too if Pancakeswap become Cross-chain and will attract more investors.\n\n4) CAKE price will pump cause less people have to sell the token for BNB and more people will buy it for ALT-CAKE farming.", "choices": ["Yes, I want ALT-CAKE LP farms", "No,  don't want ALT-CAKE LP farm"], "start": 1615543200, "end": 1616756400, "snapshot": "5612965", "state": "closed", "author": "0x02d425Afd5094e9E11B9A2999256f66Aa87DeA1c", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 14, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmV6DgNqvuUCfQfEdN64SGiR3x9gdmQHcVjGxMn13M48TK", "voter": "0x00DE408B7FA563E9D25cf7e26EEcD98Fd8f6C889", "created": 1616580122, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmWEKV9UQeEwNGiV39cm8RDqHDd5KQTdbPoNWuMNTcaUqq", "voter": "0x0d77331c64776dd9cf7baD24f6f86c5FBAd3b9Db", "created": 1616578961, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmR7NqZrw6b84UhZQTpamJJmpnWi8UsgC8E1zDHEj8otQt", "voter": "0x9A10454f49C0c3fD8b0996b7BfA132807aB51dbd", "created": 1616562791, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmX59EYNmMGWoGv62d4b7iD9v69iDTDsMt5GwD4ZtWNtXF", "voter": "0xeB8Ae51C121aa4594df3D5656840443642E674C7", "created": 1616516142, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmT4bzQjMVG9RBdzKKWMF5VZ36UpyFaWBHkrG4mmZCMFfx", "voter": "0x78E15f4898027fD9b9Aa2E69634E2E2d7fEeaAD5", "created": 1616245415, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmPtnqZKRzuUzMHwezmy6Uen7hLx6ermFdFEN3cNGBB4HQ", "voter": "0x08C8CBbD7De24DaEC7b3e65852B42A7d67713349", "created": 1616046583, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmVtscaUo9cpQGfLRtKXwRrp4FWAg5WqWqsT5kmpQPifow", "voter": "0x29cf025d0aC42B6c47933482CdbfD718dc475F8e", "created": 1615967552, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmQPMgV8HcvxJ5Lmio2PdFEKpQaobZFLxYd2wPbZYXPrf7", "voter": "0xfdb7982D571cc947B6A53308e7e049FfE0aC2fa0", "created": 1615712180, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmZrMGevLtvY9th5cCGyHBbzCiv3gdLC5GSfxNPPLQZhDY", "voter": "0x4FAcEb3eC6a2Da04710e0540b8597C824a41edBD", "created": 1615632389, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmcZYtqKQqrshf2SFe9rB6XS4MLUJVCjcX2pePLAezEKd4", "voter": "0x6cC91aC00B7014C73a994AC705186b54e729a386", "created": 1615590126, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmSEM8cgMRNRCn8odUNEnzow2JSdamtLFbod7yQcz3MhJx", "voter": "0xab9edE4A56c3f368A3700c02F2091e93594c5605", "created": 1615588896, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmRCyTMSueDrPZ1NLN88PTkJaGkSSbxpRg5xBZv4za8eBW", "voter": "0xe67602Bd14f9D851d6cB3a18763577DbabFAe065", "created": 1615576845, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmUUNrsSVGe3Dnp8Je3FMCviykmhzNp8xkKsnqNDm54B2x", "voter": "0xb705748859488a8Cb5E39d6d9ad99a83f50F9563", "created": 1615545662, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmQom78dTLkaUp3UaE7Z89LTAyXfT7TRFw5xNqK2zw5hKK", "voter": "0x02d425Afd5094e9E11B9A2999256f66Aa87DeA1c", "created": 1615543950, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
