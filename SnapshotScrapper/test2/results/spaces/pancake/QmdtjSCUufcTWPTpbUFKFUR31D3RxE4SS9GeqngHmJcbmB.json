We should add a lottery where the participant deposits the ticket size in CAKE which after the lottery the ticket losses two percent of its value.  We increase the lockup time by the ticket have to be locked up before the draw by several hours.  The one winner takes the pool plus a relatively small fixed amount of CAKE from treasury.  The numbers below are for example.\n\n50 players put in 100 CAKE.  At the bell they lose 2 CAKE each.  That leaves 100 CAKE for the one winner plus the juice from the house.\n\n500 players put in 100 CAKE or 500 tickets are bought.  That leaves 1000 CAKE plus the juice for the winner.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1604725200, "end": 1605416400, "snapshot": "1990913", "state": "closed", "author": "0xda67c6423FCD8aBEa9A02Ef515EdfB62880D2738", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVQs79A1981omTpLZjVgcDhcB9FsqafbpTwFCY3fgLX2y", "voter": "0x7cA330634bFe5668176b69840e39F47AE4f1d0a4", "created": 1605287956, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmQYXwoQWGLpa6dbixbBEVpnCBEs8CzDfhD3j3FhtFQgFt", "voter": "0x0061323f79a3B1E442C999FB0Ff3B240202d1a1A", "created": 1605282321, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmcvveCf1fSaEpY8BtJLnFAjXXyNi4mqrcoDdsgsv2xdji", "voter": "0xda67c6423FCD8aBEa9A02Ef515EdfB62880D2738", "created": 1604726860, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
