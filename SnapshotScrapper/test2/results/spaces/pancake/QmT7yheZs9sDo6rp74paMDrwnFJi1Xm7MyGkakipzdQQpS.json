{"id": "QmT7yheZs9sDo6rp74paMDrwnFJi1Xm7MyGkakipzdQQpS", "title": "Fix lottery ticket prices in $'s", "body": "As the value of CAKE fluctuates in the market, the entry level for lottery tickets can become too high for some. Instead of regularly voting on the number of CAKE required to participate to the lottery can't we fix the price in terms of $ value? That way we make sure that everyone can participate even if they only have a small stack of CAKE.\n\nHow would this work since we pay in CAKE not in $'s? \n\nLet's say (as an example!) that we agree on a fixed 5$ price for a single lottery ticket. Right before a new lottery starts we can snapshot the current price of CAKE and determine the amount of CAKE required to participate on the current lottery. In case 1 CAKE is worth $13.5 we can say the price to buy one single lottery ticket is 0.37 CAKE (5$/13.5$). In case the value of CAKE increases to $20 (5$/20$) by the time the next lottery starts the price to participate would drop from 0.37 CAKE to 0.25 CAKE.\n\nIn my opinion this would greatly increase the number of participants and will also have a positive impact on the number of CAKE burned. Large stackholders can still buy multiple tickets to increase their chances.\n\nThis vote is not intended to fix the price to 5$ or any other dollar amount but only to agree or disagree on the mechanism I propose. The exact price per ticket can be determined after this proposal is agreed upon.", "choices": ["Yes, # CAKE depends on $ value", "No, always the same # CAKE"], "start": 1615287600, "end": 1615719600, "snapshot": "5531991", "state": "closed", "author": "0x68a6477469663A135Cc213ECDD9B8B98B41bA571", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmS7mvkDxwoDJh3NSHw1x6LAfNvGmRVsYTr9J8JFz8rhJ3", "voter": "0xa3D4a2Fc2c6327fef4B95f0436498C5309763DB3", "created": 1615710026, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmWzSuofocCfTrf9SVSiXini7VM1A62jX5A68jVgWjT7qr", "voter": "0x2E43f5f3F2CFF812f8329B5238351670eeb9649a", "created": 1615660812, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmSqV5ncRZ4p3r63mv4w6arMhfRWwFa9oQHAg8Khz6NjgV", "voter": "0x25ce7C62C036A271bc3C05f09965E089979BC8a6", "created": 1615642435, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmRKx32zymXk2Qd6rc212dhLqm9gRuxzjr4RPbdJoXjGwC", "voter": "0x4FAcEb3eC6a2Da04710e0540b8597C824a41edBD", "created": 1615640072, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmSevjnj1cvv7pNib579GUixSd7KDrVRe9J7mtxcCzDGuq", "voter": "0xab9edE4A56c3f368A3700c02F2091e93594c5605", "created": 1615588445, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmccSsR1HsdFmkr3rLngRUSu1FAgteZ4UUDksUgiKi4kCy", "voter": "0xb705748859488a8Cb5E39d6d9ad99a83f50F9563", "created": 1615542919, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmTUpcW7z9VtFVAJkiX1asCGP7UU8Rbusa6JDUSuCynMsb", "voter": "0xc04C7B2DB97dAAD349E69B2dC94CA4C8962F65ea", "created": 1615513119, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmfSXhiE4TEUT9FFzHdMChzJ9W8Cvz9h4VLayqJXhmokVs", "voter": "0xaD45A548b9C779eF5a2b6466c54955b183D8555F", "created": 1615422734, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmVK2AjCCP7tPFt9HftJYazbKZtQcgdCgJvfMShumEnKqG", "voter": "0xF5d2aEFED6e7F2fd5869e0148Eff080c3Ce4016B", "created": 1615409325, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmaQWctZNSBah8z73Lpd7cVJ9FpNH2DR2rkNf2HvGenBSi", "voter": "0xD274DfCc02d8928E50CE31e62505E136ccE45Db0", "created": 1615304065, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmcsVqkKdT8dr6p9a7mbHcreWYSS47dd2L5Bxu3MAE6AEw", "voter": "0x68a6477469663A135Cc213ECDD9B8B98B41bA571", "created": 1615302694, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
