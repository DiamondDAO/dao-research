This often leads to a frustrating situation in which the system determines that you lost even though you saw it in real-time that you won.\n\nIt is like betting and watching on a live horse race which's the final result was determined from an average of 12 other horse races around the world.\n\nWe don't care about the result of other horse races, we only care about the one that we are watching.\n\nTo remedy this, we should eliminate the Chainlink source and use Binance's BNB/USDT to determine the final price. The truth should be determined by what we witness.", "choices": ["Fix it by using single feed", "No change - Keep being mad"], "start": 1619798400, "end": 1621008000, "snapshot": "7020443", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB6147cDb896f8B7f849559b8066f2ff5b2f9dF31", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmai2qADoHYZTyHJpPqUaKc76Bav37HpaADtYz4g13CdoD", "voter": "0x2Ae451C7cE53c14cfA90A81c211ff32cCDf31b9E", "created": 1620741094, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmSVRrimESF3ihxNTQwDnwkRWqoeJieNSThbexm16U6Kbb", "voter": "0x6531caBfF162C82E3DcB5E1aB05d7AB7EC78Df7E", "created": 1620323862, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmaWrx6MvcPL8qmoBqBvAvvgdbYdUHx2KxFyYuqYi7E4KW", "voter": "0x5593AC5F317B7d5307D20677973DBcD308eB6fc9", "created": 1620191459, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmZKoMHqvw8oTLGjmTJek4Puk3bi1Mpd87VFKM33saSsWu", "voter": "0x221CFC30A489E9eb2ffB36019a61749Bb3B52cD3", "created": 1620119917, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmefRdGizWMXe6jMjpH1xKAEWewikDnkcptfc7c4rZ7fEf", "voter": "0x4F2E054928ECa83dB875AE0e652d721D94968a00", "created": 1620087707, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmZ1kYuk1j21pFdPRHYLenhW6rwcQuf1qp2jreZUx3dN6L", "voter": "0xa37023933715Ae766f38689a75a525f351c50C1a", "created": 1619976679, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmaC9pTZjTUGVztG1egnbsJc6unm3FECg5tHGBGvUoBY3a", "voter": "0x077ce66F653085D3DD19E1160B574FBE1DA81150", "created": 1619976660, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmNZuU8xTprHfH5eGf5XaPzbkNiP3uouaxBn8XBvYVdsvM", "voter": "0xc0871A89f710FE26e5f3e66B1ADC1462286fD4A7", "created": 1619972963, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmdnZf9Wu5XBHNc9ACGiiYMy4hK97hHjkDvDNkfK646HFv", "voter": "0xbCD4045C0284d9C2d0F74f6278B31CB7E6433B6f", "created": 1619897192, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmVgosKDZ4ve1ikFUew6132CJpA1CxNgtUqsD1MNbN7yqX", "voter": "0xB6147cDb896f8B7f849559b8066f2ff5b2f9dF31", "created": 1619801329, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
