These tokens have no liquidity on PancakeSwap and some have irregular prices for certain pairs due to the price levels set by the initial LP who has also pulled out. Having these tokens ready for trade is a win for everyone and we the PancakeSwap Community should help drive their up their liquidity and presence on the Binance Smart Chain", "choices": ["Yes, add farms for AAVE, SNX and SUSHI", "No, don't add these farms"], "start": 1613473200, "end": 1614186000, "snapshot": "4899525", "state": "closed", "author": "0x478fa4C971a077038B4Fc5C172c3Af5552224ccc", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTqhBjAbTG8RuTSmjzyFccoZxpH3a6vKt5w4EkrqgHYWa", "voter": "0x781512097F7246aF10ea92B2fa381B90093F442C", "created": 1614154287, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmbwktHh41mcd7uzHmacdXstGpDhUZhmyEqBXvWSNzL7m3", "voter": "0xC4fAFdBc4f2123876B4384092D1B93A4748B7e85", "created": 1614040848, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmQdKjb2bn85m5x29UzhYhNhNNqnfc43PGBvT5gmpEPE7E", "voter": "0xA72aC6d494bd5FdD060F0Fc48C7F25106bE1cAe4", "created": 1614009008, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmVFzJKnscdE3VFZyTXFhMZcNPPVNsrkaSxNRKSSeSb5oF", "voter": "0x268A551c683ec29d6e0F4AeAb4765A5851BFaa01", "created": 1613940354, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmabbZ39bubBkzMMZLbWbn4sRRNK16RDE3sVsZ8m8nmLfF", "voter": "0x41b61fb95A03699FbB383cb7f5935F5230c8cAf8", "created": 1613858329, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmUcFAMgzhNP1H29gNmHEiPRFAA9BLrE8F4YZrmyYbFVsC", "voter": "0x1A791f239E268afa5028b23Bea6C40EEa5aa59A0", "created": 1613767203, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmWRRgtLuk8591KvtNoBZeNAu1ctidgpi9MPCLkAphBwbN", "voter": "0x9A44BDdEFBD7dB05db296Eb53b543885c7bB5e13", "created": 1613501752, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmUifvD3rTVHD2AxAQzEDunFmNd4SLFqhCuh42d8EbtDRz", "voter": "0x426b78Fe594c44461d5B6EE805c73ea2E4C8F297", "created": 1613501721, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmSjTKWBKLtpJVvVMj94CQk2y3Emp69JyULLSEyfxMnPxL", "voter": "0xb984730D61D4dBEe781E9A8e1136300e490049d2", "created": 1613501682, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmahcWGmBTRKJe4Z9FVCMDZNTxxgSnobHbtcxtZyee9gtd", "voter": "0x66664757B6D8CAe2a311b66eA2c0D22DA1795C23", "created": 1613501645, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmRTZQ4fEcM7bY55uByxBU7WRoUySa7H8MgPpQobwvi3Ub", "voter": "0x2B86486477D007b75286474458ED45594320a580", "created": 1613501591, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
