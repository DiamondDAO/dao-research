As well known, the 1:1 Syrup/Cake ratio is the golden rule. But if a inversely proportional ratio to the CAKE/BUSD price were implemented to others tokens, the cake price would be more attractive to purchase in the market, for example, if CAKE price are about 0.50 $BUSD, then the deposit ratio to BUSD would be like 2:1 Syrup. Undoubtedly, this ratio could be dynamic, and change with the increase/decrease in CAKE value. This artifice could generate greater price stability for CAKE and SYRUP tokens, which would be beneficial in the long term for the project.", "choices": ["Yes, i agree", "No way"], "start": 1603936800, "end": 1604498400, "snapshot": "1754397", "state": "closed", "author": "0x28DEbCF06200a1823FD6C601cc1a70456C2FF084", "space": {"id": "pancake", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNZG7V8ArY2AHibYJAuJzcrSB2WkYTzJQg7NMzpxB5akq", "voter": "0x28DEbCF06200a1823FD6C601cc1a70456C2FF084", "created": 1604007480, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmbdwMJPZz5SmcFrSst4t6ZpudUF676978reAzcB9kT6bk", "voter": "0x8bc3491E7D5AE64ebb59f6A1D2d19d89b166021d", "created": 1603970783, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmYLWGSomeVw28KsJeGrVgnZuxH9c5aiZUfg7qKL2LzqMH", "voter": "0xdf01E0aAfC63eCB707eecEA949Db21FE3d6D1742", "created": 1603940094, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}, {"id": "QmeZ17d48gdu7AAA7Gqf5DC4VfxxQvFLMLdu4CS4JDdJSC", "voter": "0xb2e6B4Ebd2598FA0559A868E24e4c47a9606708E", "created": 1603939619, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "pancake"}}]}
