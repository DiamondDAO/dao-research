So users will deposit mUSD in the IdleCDO and then those funds will get deposited + staked in mStable vaults through the strategy. The tokenized position will then be sent to the IdleCDO contract which will be the final holder.\n\nAll MTA rewards should be sold and the gain should be redeposited in Save so to generate additional yield\n\nDesired Impact:\nThis integration would unlock mUSD deposits into Idle tranches product as well as increase the volume of mUSD routed into Save. \nMore mUSD minted and deposited into Save increases overall Save APY for Savers, provide new use cases for mUSD \n\nTranches allow users to enjoy optimized DeFi yields with built-in protection on deposits by holding the Senior class, and leveraged yield exposure with Junior one. Idle Perpetual Yield Tranches is an epoch-free model: liquidity providers can now deposit and withdraw anytime, with no maturity date or locking period\n\nAdditional Comments:\nIdle Finance will put up its own bounty for this integration idea soon, it will look very much like this one\nhttps://gov.idle.finance/t/grant-idle-perp-yield-tranche-convex-strategy/676\n\nBounty Amount:\n1300 - 6300 MTA\nIdle offered 500-2000 IDLE, i.e $1500-7500$ for this task.", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1636488000, "end": 1637697600, "snapshot": "13584575", "state": "closed", "author": "0xC5e1569772b2d425Ac9469d39F17341C01e1CF4c", "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth", "name": "mStable Grants"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xf6d6bfc745bad5194903f64ff9959b304c965df1a4c597f4cc73e28b5552958e", "voter": "0x48A7BEA12A800957113662d27468fD1C9E8D42Aa", "created": 1636734400, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0xf07f0d26eec545572afe8b1537473dd81654780b87783dbff2a58c4c2521fe68", "voter": "0x2Ee8670d2b936985D5fb1EE968810c155D3bB9cA", "created": 1636711531, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x767e4d9217772ba7d3ba493595d51aa638cfa8fddb75789097ac826b774aae13", "voter": "0xb56E5F571cc818BFE83Ca1122E086F80F50DEe55", "created": 1636704280, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x7e53c9bfae576843c748a2bfd79cd1f09de71ec87fab13e5505b110f8f10d68b", "voter": "0x46fc1aB5582055C13B259A458E22eBa591e5D8eb", "created": 1636574256, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0x06fb92162ede0802843d8cec00dc82fc22d89daa7702d94c2b800a67c5011abd", "voter": "0xE76Be9C1e10910d6Bc6b63D8031729747910c2f6", "created": 1636517066, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb724b156210711e34d9e55216ab4cee7cc5f80612c6df6b88b840ea3cb506910", "voter": "0x0E4489998a3eAEBa52B3623268E47f62065aC09B", "created": 1636509410, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth"}}, {"id": "0xa84f937210c0c55318d643c9d01f55a856ac6b74036a6a5510da1fa0dd7ddb64", "voter": "0xC5e1569772b2d425Ac9469d39F17341C01e1CF4c", "created": 1636494067, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth"}}]}
