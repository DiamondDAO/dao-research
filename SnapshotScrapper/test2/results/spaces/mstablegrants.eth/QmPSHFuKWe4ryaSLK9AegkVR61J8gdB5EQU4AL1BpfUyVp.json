{"id": "QmPSHFuKWe4ryaSLK9AegkVR61J8gdB5EQU4AL1BpfUyVp", "title": "Atlantis World", "body": "Project Description:\nAtlantis World is a pixel metaverse with token-gating, video calling, gamified DeFi + in-game DAO voting. We believe that as much as metaverse should be open, it should be accessible (lightweight) + plug into DeFi applications in a fun / gamified way.\n\nWe are adding video/audio calling capabilities to user-owned, token-gated spaces inside of our pixel metaverse for communities to interact with each other; whilst gamifying DeFi protocols like Aave / Yearn / Sushi, curating interactive learning modules in our Web3 Academy + gamifying DAO voting.\n\nWe\u2019re also building public spaces + rethinking decentralized governance in collaboration with our community. We plan to build the City of Atlantis -> a buzzing, entrepreneurial capital owned / governed by its users / inhabitants, where ETH is money + creative culture is king. If users want to open a business, like a virtual cafe, music venue, movie theatre or an independent art exhibition, they'll be able to apply to occupy land for free to do something creative.\n\nFunding Objective:\nIntegrate mStable save, pools, and swap products inside of Atlantis on Polygon or ETH mainnet.\n\nFunding Schedule:\n$15,000 USD immediately\n\nRecipient's Address:\n0x8Ca2FBF18c57999d07109eF257d5340746EFBC9D\n\nAdditional Assistance:\nJoint marketing, Tech Support", "choices": ["For, Mainnet", "For, Polygon", "Against"], "start": 1632855600, "end": 1633460400, "snapshot": "13318791", "state": "closed", "author": "0xC5e1569772b2d425Ac9469d39F17341C01e1CF4c", "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth", "name": "mStable Grants"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmV7Vz7oiGCkJD5qNrGu7NbzVCepBee4JbfDndHH5W6oWU", "voter": "0x48A7BEA12A800957113662d27468fD1C9E8D42Aa", "created": 1633006411, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTswNqhN5eeVfFTAK13xNZYdN49ypRHoHGGJX4DVrv5tS", "voter": "0x0E4489998a3eAEBa52B3623268E47f62065aC09B", "created": 1632968316, "choice": [1, 2], "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ1L2PPC1kBrXYMfPxojANn13mUXStfad8YCza8LPsQpQ", "voter": "0x46fc1aB5582055C13B259A458E22eBa591e5D8eb", "created": 1632933261, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYU36V4RFTWy46KvH5WYjDfpJpwJT9my6qs31T1S7SU75", "voter": "0xb56E5F571cc818BFE83Ca1122E086F80F50DEe55", "created": 1632898462, "choice": [1, 2], "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPfNmRWxSu9K8p11BfWPMSN5bZDQ6NSDdet9kjNbhE1wo", "voter": "0xE76Be9C1e10910d6Bc6b63D8031729747910c2f6", "created": 1632898244, "choice": [2, 1], "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmedNBvYSWN9V6ajXKAhZoS1nAgFy469nAKoFNcU435hSg", "voter": "0xC5e1569772b2d425Ac9469d39F17341C01e1CF4c", "created": 1632895303, "choice": [1, 2], "space": {"id": "mstablegrants.eth"}}]}
