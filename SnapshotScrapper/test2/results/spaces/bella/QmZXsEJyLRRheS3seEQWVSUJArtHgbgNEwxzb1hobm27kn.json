This is not to say that these will be the only products that can and should be built, as the project must react swiftly to any new opportunities, but should serve as a positive guide in allowing community participation in Bella's product roadmap. \n\nThus, this proposal will feature the original 5 products mentioned to poll fellow community members on what we would like to see built first. \n\nA snapshot of BEL holdings will occur at https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/10880000 for this vote, just to give everbody time to get BEL into their own wallets and off exchanges.\n", "choices": [" Liquidity Mining", "Flex Savings", "One-Click", "Lending", "Robo-Advisor"], "start": 1600171200, "end": 1600344000, "snapshot": "10880000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x255AAB0b5b9cb16cA2246bcF66b25eFF59A693C0", "space": {"id": "bella", "name": "Bella"}, "votes": 15, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmfUf6o69DQ9mWuoRCqvd3kxAjb8M2vuQrspxZ4mWEREsg", "voter": "0xa148a1AB83056866B981AB6D62B735916B95E452", "created": 1600343850, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "bella"}}, {"id": "QmVEQ1rrj91PVQvRUSofmt71u1dRXrr1TGC7nYHTcr8foB", "voter": "0x86A3F8C7686E1FB0581B50B303289A97b8603DbA", "created": 1600343709, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bella"}}, {"id": "QmYHqmASqwyBZjnbaAFNK7xt7JDQp64g8NfcUaBCDHL4Ae", "voter": "0x53785083745174fAB70f8655E027E3074694678A", "created": 1600339157, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bella"}}, {"id": "Qmeqs4n5i9Bg3cJ4hUcei49NHGF6LUBeaHji8bjz1n2uuE", "voter": "0xdbE18c7535b988Db1F3C401ab241E369A14CBF07", "created": 1600337335, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bella"}}, {"id": "QmbtsjJDQgttGe5TouCdmkRYLH9KA78mFwxSzeK4HHCpoU", "voter": "0x7A8E7b7197E94D2Cb194DBED7a80575c047A7575", "created": 1600337109, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "bella"}}, {"id": "QmVAxwk5MTGUhndSkTtSXjodTB96zVBwzKwGLn4AU2dsEE", "voter": "0x341B5fF25dc92589a7c6154B2738c45A26f7091C", "created": 1600337104, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bella"}}, {"id": "QmVCR3E6Ls2Brve8NG19Qsvx9BgdMrtCT5ntepQWsDhhFH", "voter": "0xC1E820E94bf7AeD7d9c55175a5Bcc3F997253993", "created": 1600335842, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "bella"}}, {"id": "QmTdVPGkQGweZs67PLPT2Ds5vzV5UWFjNseMN3WkSdDfW3", "voter": "0xff88ea0249dcb99681dD4f98Bf70aD12E11F3167", "created": 1600335502, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "bella"}}, {"id": "QmdUxGyP12uAa72JAfNS9Qoiy1WSTtPTQDoQ2J9DTNUubk", "voter": "0xcE156D5d62a8F82326dA8d808D0f3F76360036D0", "created": 1600332930, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "bella"}}, {"id": "QmS7mx3CQfxBP67Mb3P1cUJh1tuSRsM2J7kMhtFaHXjs5g", "voter": "0x024f343f4af8Ae9bbcda189BFc7292453024748e", "created": 1600332336, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bella"}}, {"id": "QmRoYYsFLpkUmqWDe2zZf6sLiYu9ChYtm9p7aXY95BGfxb", "voter": "0x30099dd26CFbDBF628699cf4358b866C6eAFCc06", "created": 1600330470, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bella"}}, {"id": "QmPDpgAiquJMpBDEEow9MDiq5ocGtLXr2YjXrnFPKgprD2", "voter": "0xE1eb2F770FD691966D9801Cc479b85E292ad7fdE", "created": 1600330083, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "bella"}}, {"id": "QmRx7mnv8z82RxYDUvQ4q6TCwK1DMvVsLRPcvH1sY4cnPX", "voter": "0x18350608fdE346E4eCdD7D4fdd969e4BaaC6030B", "created": 1600330044, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "bella"}}, {"id": "QmVPuynCS6chYK7Uf3gPGvP3HxjC5nMagJeuP45754ydqq", "voter": "0xd70013215C0a6b3c22B191063F9e0AF6880d97eB", "created": 1600329359, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "bella"}}, {"id": "QmPA4NWydds3kkoG72tQ26U7c4Gj3qtsRo5Zgq8jM8szk9", "voter": "0x563316c43a67800554F0E4A241A71874C933D49b", "created": 1600328352, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "bella"}}]}
