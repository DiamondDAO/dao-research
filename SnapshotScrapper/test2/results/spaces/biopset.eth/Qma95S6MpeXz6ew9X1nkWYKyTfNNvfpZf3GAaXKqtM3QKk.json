So far two different proposals are on the table for how to structure the  event. \n\nFirst is a bancor curve based IBCO. This would mean that after every token purchase the price goes up (like bonding curves and AMMs that exist on many other platforms). i.e. you buy one token the price goes up.\n\nSecond is a tiered offering.  This would mean that the price only increases when certain thresholds are met.  i.e. when the total amount of tokens sold hits 100 the price goes up.", "choices": ["Bancor based IBCO", "Tiered ITCO"], "start": 1615482000, "end": 1615694400, "snapshot": "12021124", "state": "closed", "author": "0x59cE5702F124ae45D63ae1c531E41b8c456a072d", "space": {"id": "biopset.eth", "name": "BIOPset Settlement DAO"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYj9dAiW3qtK8SfSDRRxVP768y7CTW14tMR9AvVQyf8X5", "voter": "0x5814eBfA4c49c60fE898A63C907f8E345419308a", "created": 1615675881, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "biopset.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTBK3HxK7zyPwDcKucfWcE79t1egvc5qGGs8NAEYmhnww", "voter": "0x59cE5702F124ae45D63ae1c531E41b8c456a072d", "created": 1615675761, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "biopset.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRL1jgeHjpsuP92wWgJ87vaHMh2HHnxuL7i9vUEfyiW1a", "voter": "0x8950D9117C136B29A9b1aE8cd38DB72226404243", "created": 1615581622, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "biopset.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUi43k1CiGAgbHymkFBmBUqZRsH2zj3i1G8q9srCwZJat", "voter": "0x3DAc271d1B36A434880C527A678B6487AC9C1F8c", "created": 1615564400, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "biopset.eth"}}]}
