They call it ROI (return on investment) alternatively. For example, if you invest 100 dollars in a savings account and the bank tells you that the yield (ROI) is 100%, you understand that at the end of the term (usually 1 year) the amount of money in your account becomes 200 dollars. \u2028\u2028\n\nBanks (and all other financial institutions for that matter) do not quote the yield as 200% even though you get 2X. \n\n\u2028\u2028The key thing to keep in mind when voting is how would you display the yield on losing. The \u201cmoney in your account\u201d goes to zero. Is that -100% yield, or is that 0% yield (ROI)?\n\nLastly, for the poll above please remember that the loss is not 0 ETH. You actually lose your deposit/investment (100 ETH). So it should really read:\n\nOPTION A:\n- Maximum Return (WIN): 200 ETH\n- Minimum Return (LOSS): -100 ETH\n- Maximum Yield (WIN): 100%\n- Minimum Yield (LOSS): -100%\n\nOPTION B:\n- Maximum Return (WIN): 200 ETH\n- Minimum Return (LOSS): -100 ETH\n- Maximum Yield (WIN): 200%\n- Minimum Yield (LOSS): 0%", "choices": ["Option A", "Option B"], "start": 1615341600, "end": 1615435200, "snapshot": "12008100", "state": "closed", "author": "0x59cE5702F124ae45D63ae1c531E41b8c456a072d", "space": {"id": "biopset.eth", "name": "BIOPset Settlement DAO"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYV7SJyoodWsryigaZikrdfAKUREgtJo6bWSwpo5W4PYy", "voter": "0x5814eBfA4c49c60fE898A63C907f8E345419308a", "created": 1615394658, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "biopset.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP5ghBMayqTKWzF4GNwxzta1VvsvFsBMcfmBuSoBVU9KH", "voter": "0x59cE5702F124ae45D63ae1c531E41b8c456a072d", "created": 1615394086, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "biopset.eth"}}]}
