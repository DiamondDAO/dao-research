In this situation, they have suggested that we divide the money not, evenly between the different performances, but in a way that helps larger groups pay their accompanists.\n\nThe options proposed are:\n\n1.  **Distributed evenly between items**.  \n    - 5 musical performances split the money 5 ways\n2. **Weighted distribution**\n    - Performances with 1 artist earn 1 portion.\n    - Performances with 2 artists earn 1.5 portions.\n    - Performances with 3 artists earn 1.75 portions.\n\nThe amount earned will be divided by the total number of portions and distributed accordingly.\n\n3. **Equal distribution for all the artists**\n\n      The amount will be distributed to all the artists equally.  In this case, if there are 3 vocalists who have 3 musicians each, and one tabla solo with 1 accompanists, the total number of artists will equal 10.  The amount earned will be divided by all 10 artists.\n\n\n", "choices": ["Distributed evenly between items", "Weighted distribution", "Equal distribution"], "start": 1627401600, "end": 1627660800, "snapshot": "12914672", "state": "closed", "author": "0xcA46EA2cF5d2704e09537AF7e681BD98e4F073d4", "space": {"id": "viewcy.eth", "name": "Thursday Evening Ragas"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
