It also provides a recognizable geometric design.\n\nLOGO #4: The dynamic rings represent the previous three tokens merging into one unified Thorus.\n\nLOGO #5: The split halves of the orb represent the peaks and valleys we as a community have experienced and have come out stronger for. The center also depicts the letter T.\n\nQUESTION: What logo are you voting for?", "choices": ["LOGO #1", "LOGO #2", "LOGO #3", "LOGO #4", "LOGO #5"], "start": 1637341200, "end": 1637514000, "snapshot": "12782480", "state": "closed", "author": "0x25932EfC092400f7bc62ecbb2C3EAB67F9e8bA55", "space": {"id": "waultgov.eth", "name": "WAULTx"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
