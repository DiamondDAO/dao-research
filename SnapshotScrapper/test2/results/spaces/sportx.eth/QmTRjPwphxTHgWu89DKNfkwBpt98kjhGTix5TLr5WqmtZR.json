{"id": "QmTRjPwphxTHgWu89DKNfkwBpt98kjhGTix5TLr5WqmtZR", "title": "Head of Social Media Marketing Proposal", "body": "## Intro\nSportX is a very innovative project with inherent value. As the project continues to develop and scale, it will require an organic and effective marketing strategy + message that needs to be efficiently translated to the crypto community and sports betting public at-large. \n\nI propose that I run the social media accounts and marketing/community strategy for the SportX Project. My name is @myguyknowsaguy, and I\u2019m a crypto enthusiast, media entrepreneur and most importantly, an avid sport bettor. I\u2019ve successfully grown multiple sports betting-focused twitter profiles, YouTube Channels, and Clubhouse accounts. I want to bring this experience and knowledge as the full-time social media marketing head of SportX\n\n## Responsibilities\n\n\u2022\tManage and actively grow the twitter account for SportX (SportX_Project)\n\u2022\tI will also be launching/managing a SportX Instagram account + a 2nd proposed SportX twitter account dedicated to sports betting news and dedicated SportX tournament coverage\n\u2022\tI will craft innovated and effective posts multiple times a day, amplifying the message of the project, as well updating the public on the measurable progress of the project\n\u2022\tI will launch a SportX ambassador program to partner with Crypto/Betting Influencers to develop native SportX content to further our achieve our mission of becoming the de facto decentralized sports betting platform\n\u2022\tI will run and organize popular betting tournaments both independently and in tandem with these potential influencer partners\n\u2022\tI will manage and deliver a dedicated promotions/giveaways programme \n\u2022\tI will conduct regular SportX live betting sessions on both twitch and YouTube, clearly displaying the platform and providing very engaging content.\n\u2022\tI will produce a weekly podcast discussing the progress of the project, but also interviewing relevant community members as well as discussing traditional sports picks, predictions an analysis. It will be the first crypto dedicated sports betting podcast\n\u2022\tI will help SportX dominate as a social media powerhouse in the betting space\n\u2022\tI will help moderate the SportX discord, helping the development team communicate their messages when they\u2019re busy, I will shoulder the load\n\u2022\tI will launch and moderate a SportX subreddit to fully integrate the platform onto reddit.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nBasically, my proposal is to become the full-time marketing director for SportX three-pronged approach. Building the social channels/footprint to reach critical mass, managing an ambassador program while collaborating with these ambassadors to develop cutting edge SportX related content (further amplifying those built social channels), and finally helping with the moderation of the SportX discord/reddit subs. More specifically, this will include:\n\n\u2022\tI will help the user base of SportX increase by 500% through organic social media marketing + developing cutting edge SportX content (podcast, mini-docs, live streams, video tutorials etc.) + running the SportX ambassador program\n\u2022\tI will take SportX to 50k+ followers and 5 thousand Instagram followers\n\u2022\tI will create 5-10 tweets + 2+ Instagram posts per day\n\u2022\tI will build a dedicated twitch audience building the footprint of our streams to at least 10k followers + 2k+ live concurrent viewers.\n\u2022\tI will use Twitter Analytics suites + A suite of IG influencer tools to reach millions of 15 million+ impressions a month. I\u2019ve already used these tools to take my small betting account from 200 - over 3000 in 4 months without spending a dime. I regularly get the engagements of accounts with 5-10x the following of mine by delivering quality sports betting information in a concise and entertaining manner. With resources behind me, I can take the SportX project to new heights.\n\u2022\tI will launch and moderate a quarterly digital \u201ccrypto sports betting\u201d conference, inviting some of the members of the project as well as relevant partners and ambassadors to discuss anything relevant in the space. I will deliver this experience simultaneously on twitch, YouTube and the upcoming audio chat room feature \u201ctwitter spaces\u201d which will be huge and is a feature I\u2019m already planning content strategies for.\n\u2022\tI will host a \u201cpicking tournament/league\u201d secondary twitter account for SportX tourney/league coverage following our participants\u2019 progress like a traditional sports media outfit. \n\u2022\tI will further develop the moderation of the discord server and tie in relevant technical content onto the SportX reddit sub\n\n## Roadmap\n\n### Short-term Roadmap (1-Month)\nI will begin posting consistently timed Twitter + IG content \n\u2022\tI will launch SportX twitch channels and invest resources into a quality streaming setup\n\u2022\tThe first month will be about establishing a routine of delivering quality content, while reaching out to potential ambassador candidates ahead of the program launch in month 2\n\u2022\tI will begin analyzing and tracking all of our social media metrics, so we can further hone our content for our audience no matter where they may be\n\u2022\tI will launch the SportX sub-reddit, translating all relevant materials to this reddit community that we will grow\n\u2022\tI will finalize a strategy for regular tournaments and capping leagues as well as a consistent schedule for giveaways\n\n### Medium-term Roadmap (3-Month)\n\u2022\tBy this time, we should have launched the SportX ambassador program with around 3-5 candidates that all have their high influence in either the Crypto/Betting worlds or both. \n\u2022\tWe will also have an established social media routine and will have a measurable social media footprint by this time. When these 2 events take place, I will work with these ambassadors to craft content for SportX, also inviting them to take part in the tournaments/leagues. \n\u2022\tProducing videos and interviews with our ambassadors as they interact with the platform. This ambassador strategy will accelerate our progress as our social media footprint goes, I will have established a routine of multiple social posts per day as well as announcing and administering the ambassador program. \n\u2022\tI will also announce the Digital \u201cCrypto sports betting\u201d conference which our ambassadors will take part in as well as members of the founding and development teams. \n\n## Long Term Roadmap (+6 month)\n\u2022\tBy this time, we will have established The SportX Social media marketing machine as a formidable operation. \n\u2022\tWe will regularly reach millions of impressions per month across social platforms, have a cohort of Influential Ambassadors exalting the virtues of SportX, have our own dedicated digital sports betting crypto conference, have regular betting live streams and podcasts that will integrate coverage about the development of the platform, as well as covering the tournaments/leagues. \n\u2022\tWe will do regular giveaways/promotions within reach. All of this will translate to exponential growth + accelerated user acquisition.\n\n## Funding Request\n\nThe following funds are requested:\n\u2022\t2,000 DAI and 3,000 SX per month for full-time salary\n\nThis is a total of 6,000 DAI and 9,000 SX for a three-month full-time contract. These funds are to be paid on the tenth day of every month to 0x0603B0e2778ceA72f8b41e552806dE477A221E8D in the event that the vote passes.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1619971200, "end":
