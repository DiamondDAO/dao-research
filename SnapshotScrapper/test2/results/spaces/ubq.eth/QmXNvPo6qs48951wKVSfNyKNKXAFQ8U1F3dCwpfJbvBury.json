I'm @Zequez#6608 on Discord.\nBut actually this is in fact an idea I was pondering; so let's propose it.\n\nRight now [the DAO core team is on a Notion page](https://www.notion.so/ubiquitydao/Team-21e142d3e7e1462aad74cdd9d5d06db5) without much information aside from the role of each person and their alias; which doesn't tell mech.\n\nI'm thinking about a section on the website; likely on the Dashboard (since we've already got all the Ethereum libraries there loaded) where we can list all the members of the DAO in a easy to grasp table that shows:\n\n  - Each member name\n  - Discord  / Telegram handles / Contact info\n  - Avatar of member\n  - Wallets addresses\n  - Relevant assets (UBQ, uAD, uAR, uDEBT, etc)\n  - Wether they are part of the core team and what their role is\n  - You could add a small bio to each member\n\nThe DB would be quite easy; on the repository we would make a folder where we put one `yml` file for each wallet address. So all the data is open source and public. On the web app we query the addresses with UBQ tokens, and we fill up the data from the static DB to show the table. This would all be opt-in of course; you don't need to add your data if you don't want to; but all wallets will be shown, at least anonymously.\n\nWith this we would have a public full list of all members of the DAO along with a clear overview of the core team, and the general distribution of tokens (table could be sorted and filtered by different parameters). This signals transparency; which is healthy for any organization.\n\nI can take care of doing this if there is support. I would also enjoy doing other things UX wise but that's for another proposal.\n\n\n\n", "choices": ["Yes", "I don't care", "No"], "start": 1629212400, "end": 1629817200, "snapshot": "13046133", "state": "closed", "author": "0x38CF464847069D4499F4692d1877eC3Facc95D3c", "space": {"id": "ubq.eth", "name": "Ubiquity DAO"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmbNznqo614NnwAEf3JZqkXQ6KHNSKf1NHbZi7T88RgQEz", "voter": "0x0a71e650F70B35fca8b70e71E4441df8D44E01e9", "created": 1629273293, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ubq.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQQAQ6ofkdbRqWgPkHeYG7wZDujVUSEkJeLgjwvhGJQAp", "voter": "0x4007CE2083c7F3E18097aeB3A39bb8eC149a341d", "created": 1629262704, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ubq.eth"}}]}
