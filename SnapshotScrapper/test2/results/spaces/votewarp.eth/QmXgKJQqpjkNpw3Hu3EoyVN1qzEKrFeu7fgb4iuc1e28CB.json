{"id": "QmXgKJQqpjkNpw3Hu3EoyVN1qzEKrFeu7fgb4iuc1e28CB", "title": "Launching a voting and fee sharing token, veWarp", "body": "What is veWarp and how will it work?\n\nWe believe that there should be functionality for effectively making the existing Warp Token capable of delivering governance functionalities and fee sharing on the Warp Platform. Specifically, users should be able to lock up their Warp Tokens into a vault, and will receive veWarp tokens in return. These veWarp will be capable of sharing in profits from the platform, governance over Warp Token emissions to lending pairs, as well as voting on the supported lending pairs themselves. In this manner, highly active Warp users who already have earned Warp Tokens will be able to further participate in the platform and vote on various metrics via veWarp, being additionally rewarded with shared platform fees.\n\nLockup & Minting:\n\nUnder this new Warp Token function, users would lock up Warp Tokens to mint veWarp. Specifically, users could lock Warp tokens in the vault for 1 month to 2 years, and mint veWarp in return. The longer that tokens are locked up for, the higher amount of veWarp will be generated. This veWarp is non-transferable and non-tradeable, and can only be used to vote, earn shared profits, or to be redeemed for the locked Warp tokens. There is a 50% penalty on unlocking Warp tokens earlier than the designated periods.\n\nFurthermore, in Warp V2, the platform could enable lending pairs for veWarp by giving veWarp holders receipt tokens to use as collateral. Within these pairs, we can assume 25% of the total value of the Warp backing the veWarp can be used as collateral. This is with a 200% collateralization ratio and 50% early redemption penalty. This provides an additional benefit to veWarp in addition to those listed below.\n\nPurpose and Benefits:\n\nAs mentioned, the veWarp token will be utilized to enable community governance over Warp token emissions to lending pairs, as well as the lending pairs supported on Warp. The veWarp token\u2019s governance capacities will be structured similarly to that of Curve\u2019s veCRV and SushiSwap\u2019s oSushi. Like oSushi does for SushiSwap\u2019s liquidity pairs, veWarp could act as a means for voting on the emissions to each lending pair, in addition to being used to vote for which lending pairs are supported. veWarp can be minted by locking up Warp tokens in a vault, meaning that those users earning veWarp are existing Warp protocol participants, and those earning a significant amount of veWarp must have a significant amount of Warp, which is only earned through platform participation. Warp team members could kick this off by locking up some of their team tokens for veWarp.\nFurthermore, veWarp will act as a fee sharing token similar to xSushi. veWarp gives users a share of the fees generated by the platform - meaning, the fees generated will be able to be used to purchase Warp on the open market, giving the ability for veWarp holders to redeem their veWarp for additional Warp.\n\nIn this manner, the protocol ensures that there\u2019s a close alignment between the success of the protocol and the long-term believers. Token holders who lock up their tokens the longest will have the highest voting power, and receive the highest financial incentives, all while having skin in the game and prioritizing long-term growth over short-term fees.\n\n\nVoting Process:\n\n\nOne veWarp token is proportional to one vote.\nVoting on lending pool selection and Warp token emission allocations to lending pools will occur each month. After voting, the vote will remain directed in the same pool, unless modified to select another pool, which can be done once per month. A user\u2019s veWarp can be spread out across various lending pools, so that they are able to support multiple pools in proportions of their choosing.\nGauge weighting is used to determine the amount of veWarp required for a vote to pass (i.e. for a lending pool/emissions to be supported).\nGauge weighting is calculated by dividing the total amount of veWarp voting for a particular option divided by the total amount of veWarp. Rewarded Warp tokens per vault could be calculated based on this gauge weighting.\n\n\nConclusion:\nBy enabling users to lock up their Warp tokens for veWarp, the Warp protocol could deliver essential governance and profit sharing capabilities in proportion to platform participation.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1623340800, "end": 1623945600, "snapshot": "12607244", "state": "closed",
