During that time, Warp will distribute 3000 WARP to people providing liquidity for WARP/ETH token pairings on Uniswap. By extending this program, Warp will incentivize liquidity provisioning to promote sustained liquidity for the Warp token ensuring users do not encounter any obstacles in trading it freely.\n\nWarp\u2019s present Liquidity Mining Program:\n\nThe initial, and present, installation of Warp\u2019s Liquidity Provider Rewards Program has given out 10% of the total supply of Warp tokens. The geyser system in place for Uniswap LP tokens is what allows users to generate rewards for their liquidity provisioning. The first week of the rewards program began with a \u201cLiquidity Rush\u201d where 3% of the total supply was given out to WARP/ETH LPs. After the first week, the remainder of the geyser\u2019s reward tokens were vested linearly over the course of six months. \n\nThe emission of rewards were scheduled according to each user\u2019s personal reward curve. These reward curves were based upon how much WARP LPs left unharvested; the more tokens left unharvested, the greater the reward. After six months of vesting, Warp provided the possibility of extending the rewards program through governance and the Community Fund - which we are presently proposing. \n\nReward Distribution:\n\nThe proposed reward distribution for this liquidity mining extension is 3000 WARP over the course of one year. The distribution of these rewards will mirror that of the six-month linear vesting period in which LPs were given rewards in accordance with how much WARP they left unharvested. \n\nThese reward offerings are continuously re-weighted according to: \n\nThe asset\u2019s volume on Uniswap,\nHow much has been staked into the respective LP rewards pool.\n\nIn Warp\u2019s geyser, users do not experience an opportunity cost when staking liquidity but rather earn rewards through the platform\u2019s yield farming strategies.\n\n\nPurpose and Benefits:\n\nAs mentioned before, the extension of the Warp rewards program will continue the incentivization of Warp token LPs, helping to ensure that users do not have any issues when trading the token; LPing thorough liquidity pools enables trades to happen almost instantaneously on exchanges. This further allows users to avoid slippage and to trade freely throughout the platform. \n\nA core objective of Warp is rewarding people who support its community. By extending Warp\u2019s Liquidity Providing Rewards Program, we will create an opportunity for those supporting the platform to become further invested in it. In addition, we will be ensuring liquidity of the Warp token for the good of the DeFi ecosystem as a whole.\n\n-------\nConclusion:\n\nThrough this proposed extension, Warp\u2019s Liquidity Providing Rewards Program will continue for one year. In that time, 3000 WARP will be distributed through the Warp geyser to those who participate by contributing WARP-ETH token pairings on Uniswap. This incentive will ensure sustained liquidity, enabling barrier-free trading of the Warp token. At the end of this one-year period, we (or another entity) may propose another option to further extend the Warp rewards program through governance and the Community Fund. \n", "choices": ["Yes",
