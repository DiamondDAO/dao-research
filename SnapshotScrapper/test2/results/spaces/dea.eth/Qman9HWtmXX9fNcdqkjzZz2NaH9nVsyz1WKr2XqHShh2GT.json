As of right now, the trading fees are set to 1% and we believe this forms a barrier to entry for many traders.\n\nBefore you continue reading this snapshot, please read the following article very carefully: \n\nhttps://medium.com/@dsynths/introducing-dsynths-lowering-trading-fees-7564e8751d10\n\nNot only do we (dSynths) introduce ourselves in the article, but we also highlight the pros and cons of having a reduced fee structure from a security point-of-view. The bottom line is that the ultimate fee percentage should lie within the range of 0% and 1%.\n\nWe propose to set the trading fee to 0.1% for as long as the system permits it. More context to this proposal is, once again, described in the linked article. \n\nThere are 3 options provided in this snapshot:\n1) Agree with the proposal entirely.\n2) Agree with the proposal's goal, but use a different percentage. If this vote wins, raise your voice in the DEUS Community so we can submit a new snapshot!\n3) Disagree with everything, and leave the current system as the way it is right now.
