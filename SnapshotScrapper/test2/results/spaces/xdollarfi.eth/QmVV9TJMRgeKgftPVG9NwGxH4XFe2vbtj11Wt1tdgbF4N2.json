Over the last couple of weeks XUSD has been floating between the range of $1.06 - $1.12 USDC. The premium is because of the relatively high yields the liquidity providers are able to get by providing liquidity with a \"stable coin\". Other protocols stable coins are yielding between 20-25% whereas XUSD is yielding 80-100% apr. Now, if the yields are high, wouldn't the market just do its thing and balance out the high yields, well actually no it cant and the reasons are the following:\n- The TVL for the combined XUSD pools are relatively small\n- The small TVL is also a result of the lack of liquidity of the XUSD liquidity mining reward the XDO token\n- Farmers are also reluctant to market buy XUSD tokens at a premium incase it goes to peg or below it in the future and they end up losing 7-12% of their initial capital.\n- Another reason is even though the XUSD pool yields are high, it is only superficial in nature since the XDO token has never actually gone through price discovery in liquid market conditions.\n\nI have seen the XDO token vary in price from $0.15 during poor market conditions to $0.75 during the recent MCN farming announcements. Since we still have a relatively small TVL and nowhere to dump XDO-  I will go ahead and assume that most XDO holders are believers of this project and values the token at a much higher value then it currently is at right now. The single biggest use case of the XDO token is staking it for profit sharing. The source of the profit comes from the minting fee of XUSD and liquidations. I am expecting XDO to be highly volatile so most obvious way to create a LM rewards program is to offer very high rewards in XDO for LPs risking impermanent loss of the paired asset like MATIC, XUSD, USDC or ETH, but that would result in further unnecessary dilution of the XDO treasury pool.\n\nSOLUTION:\nI propose the LM of a high XDO ratio balancer pool. For example a 90:10 or 95:5 XDO-MATIC pool. This basically means-  to provide $9 worth of XDO to the pool, LPs would only need to provide $1 worth of MATIC to the 90:10 pool. Similarly, in order to provide $19 worth of XDO LPs only need to provide $1 worth of MATIC to the 95:5 pool. To further reduce impermanent loss and increase usage of XUSD we can use XDO-XUSD pair instead. \n\nI ran a small experiment on the balancer 95:5 XDO:MATIC pool where I provided XDO at $0.15 and MATIC at $0.82. Then the MCN farming was announced and $0.52 (approximately 250% increase) and MATIC was $0.94(approximately 15%). On a normal xy = k Uniswap V2 like pool the impermanent loss would be around 25% whereas in the balancer pool the theoretical IL was about 1.5%.\n \nNow to further sweeten the pot, you can set up higher trading fees for highly volatile pools in balancer. For the experiment above, I set the trading fees at 1%, so the actual impermanent loss was 0.9% at the time of withdrawal.\n\nIf everything goes well, we will end up with an XDO  pool with deep liquidity and then the market and the farmers can run its course - XDO can go through proper price discovery. As the TVL grows XUSD pools reach critical mass, the aprs flattens out and comes very close to the desired peg. \n\n", "choices": ["95:5 XDO-MATIC Balancer Pool", "90:10 XDO-MATIC Balancer Pool", "90:10 XDO-XUSD Balancer Pool", "90:10 XDO-XUSD Balancer Pool"], "start": 1627401600, "end": 1627747200, "snapshot": "17322300", "state": "closed", "author": "0xF940CE19B9Cd0B9efd586381b488cEfB75EB413F", "space": {"id": "xdollarfi.eth", "name": "xDollar"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmbNspWi4kY9tBwa43oyrdtBQBWQBe3WSrrvJeztUG3qBw", "voter": "0x157fBaF0669a0ADd1dbE269101507b46bd43a7c5", "created": 1627689922, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "xdollarfi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeEjGFB4GuuYZ6mDFQf1Z6gtfMsdSzrTfR5VCktSa23gR", "voter": "0xf701951266c6aF7ed6d0c21D25aF4020c0dA163C", "created": 1627649087, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "xdollarfi.eth"}}]}
