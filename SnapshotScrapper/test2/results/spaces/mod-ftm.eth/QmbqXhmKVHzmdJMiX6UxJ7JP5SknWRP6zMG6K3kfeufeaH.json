Keep staking on Fantom and BSC Networks as is\n2. Keep staking on Fantom and add Matic / Polygon (removing BSC)\n3. Keep staking on BSC and add Matic / Polygon (removing Fantom)\n4. Add Matic / Polygon staking and reduce rewards across all networks\n5. Only support staking on Fantom\n6. Only support staking on BSC\n7.
