The purpose of this vote is to decide on amending the Shard chain swap deadline to reduce the time allotted for late swappers to still swap past the soft deadline of August 5th.\n\nIf passed, this proposal will reduce the time allotted for the 1/2 rate late swap to occur. The time will be reduced from the (as announced) 6 months to 2 weeks. Therefore the entire swap will be concluded on August 19th and all remaining Shard that has been saved for the swap will be burned.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy this is needed: \n\nWith the current swap continuing to linger in the Shard ecosystem, there is a great degree of confusion and uncertainty surrounding the Shard Tokenomics, statistics, and metrics. The total supply, holders, and circulating supply will all continue to be unknown with the swap ongoing.\n\nMany members of the community believe that these unknown metrics and statistics are causing a hinderance and unnecessary difficulty in establishing exchange listings and partnerships. Many exchanges and partners expect to be given accurate metrics and statistics about a Coin or Token when approached. Shard currently does not have this info about its ecosystem and it will not until the swap concludes.\n\nThe market has changed and the community has shrank. The original swap assumed that the project Infinity Crypto would have a smooth and a strong start with a ton of liquidity and volume. If that had occurred, the swap would not be affecting us as bad as it currently is. That simply is not how things have played out and therefore we need to make some decisions in order to help the project and Token/Coin in any way we can! Ceasing the swap will allow us to have these vital metrics and statistics that will allow us many more opportunities.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNegatives: \n- People that have not swapped by the final deadline of August 19th will not be able to swap to the new chain but still have Shard on the old chain if they want to continue it. (The community could still vote at a later date to possibly use some treasury funds as a compensation fund if many individuals can prove they have missed the swap).\n\nPositives: \n- Shard can move forward allowing for potential easier exchange listings and partnerships with the reveal of accurate statistics and metrics.\n- Forces those who have been taking advantage of staking on the legacy chain to swap over and introduce their funds to the liquidity and staking pools to benefit the current project.\n- We can know exactly how many are in the community without waiting another 6 months.\n- Removes those who are no longer active in the project and community and may have taken a different path forward.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal words: \n\nThe community members involved in construction of this proposal passionately believe that voting to approve this decision will benefit the project a lot more in the current market and ecosystem than if we were to leave it as is. This will allow Shard and the project to move on and will be able to provide us with accurate values to those vital metrics and statistics that we require. \n\nSome of the community believe this is an essential action needed in order to begin the next stage of growth while cutting all strings holding us back to the past.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVoting Option Key:\n\n#1: Approve\n- Meaning this proposal is approved with the swap being reduced to 1/2 rate on August 5th and concluding entirely on August 19th with a burn to follow. \n\n1/2 rate means: (if you swap 500 Shard you will receive 250 Shard).\n\n#2: Decline\n- Meaning you disagree with this proposal and do not want it to pass.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis vote will require 5% of the Shard circulating supply to take part (around 1,500,000 Shard) with at least 51% or more agreeing to APPROVE.", "choices": ["Approve", "Decline"], "start": 1626537600, "end": 1627185540, "snapshot":
