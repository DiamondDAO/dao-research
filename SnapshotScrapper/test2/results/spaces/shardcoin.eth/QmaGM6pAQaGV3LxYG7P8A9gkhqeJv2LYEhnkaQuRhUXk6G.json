{"id": "QmaGM6pAQaGV3LxYG7P8A9gkhqeJv2LYEhnkaQuRhUXk6G", "title": "Community Governance - Slice Community Lead Shard Allocation", "body": "This vote is to finalize a community governance proposal that has passed the In-agreement check. The purpose of this vote is to decide on whether the community member Slice should be allocated Shard to become a Community Lead for the Shard community. \n\nThe proposers of this proposal strongly believe that in order to promote a healthy and growing community there needs to be a few essential roles with obligations fulfilled on a daily basis.\n\nThe below points will be covered under the umbrella term of \u201cCommunity Lead\u201d that this proposal is advocating for Slice to be voted in to:\n\n1.) Community Organization & Management:\n- Managing the community with regular user engagement, discussion, and events to strengthen the community bond;\n- Creating content and maintaining a knowledge base within the community;\n- Promoting and assisting all other community members to explore and seek out any initiatives and ideas they have;\n- Organizing the community for shilling and advertising initiatives;\n- Directing the community on where to focus efforts for advertising;\n\nWith the main focus on developing new ways to attract and grow activity within Discord, Telegram, and across other social channels.\n\n--\n\n2.) Marketing which is the main focus of this proposal:\n\nFinding ways to bring new value and growth to Shard via non-paid marketing initiatives including:\n- Reaching out, building, and finding potential partnerships;\n- Discovering ways to bring further exposure and growth to Shard without funds or relying on community members;\n- Organizing community fundraising (with the management of funds by the Core Team);\n\nAdditionally, this role will consist of working with the core team to find new ways to bring growth and adoption to Shard via paid marketing initiatives, utilizing the community fund and other available funds.\n\n\n----------------------\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 WORK HOURS ----------------------\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSlice\u2019s official work hours will be 8:00 AM to 2:00 PM EST Monday-Friday, working a minimum of 30 hours per week. However, he will make himself available outside of those hours as needed for meetings or on an as-needed basis. Slice may put in more hours per week outside of those scheduled hours at his discretion.\n\n\n----------------------\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 PAYMENT ----------------------\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Community Lead will receive a monthly payout of Shard from the treasury as a payment for his service. Slice is requesting 1,100 Shard per week until Shard reaches $1 USD (at which the payment will be revisited at this time).\n\nSlice is well aware that receiving an income paid in Shard creates a negative selling pressure. Being a widely passionate supporter of Shard, he stated he will try his best to fund his bills as much as he can outside of Shard until liquidity can support the sell pressure.\n\n----------------------\u2014 WHY IS THIS NEEDED ----------------------\u2014\n\nIt is very clear that with all great projects, there also must be a great community to support and push the project to even greater heights than ever before. Shard has the fundamentals, however the community is currently small and tight knit. It is not nearly strong enough at its current status.\n\nKey crypto events like Binance\u2019s MVB and others heavily rely on community engagement and involvement and Shard/Infinity Crypto simply does not have the strength to support this as it currently stands.\n\nSolidifying a Community Lead with the obligations of a Community Manager, and Community Marketing will allow this individual to focus their pure efforts into developing the community and promoting growth and exposure while also retaining that new found audience with what this community can offer.\n\n----------------------\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 NEGATIVES ----------------------\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n- A small amount out of the 44 million Shard in the treasury will be dispersed each month as a payment to Slice for this position.\n- ~57,200 will be paid out each year. At current prices ($0.114) that is $6,520.8 a year. At $0.50 that is $28,600 a year.\n- Negative selling pressure as the Shard will mostly need to be sold for living expenses if bills cannot be funded by Slice externally.\n\n\n----------------------\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 POSITIVES ----------------------\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n- The community will have a full time community manager, community marketing manager, and a community lead.\n- The Community Lead can focus full time on community organization and marketing, as well as leading new initiatives to further expand and grow Shard.\n- Individuals that have key ideas for the community will have assistance by the Community Lead to realize these goals.\n\n\n------------- TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT CONTINUATION ---------------\n\nThe community has requested there be a 30 day trial wherein Slice demonstrates he displays he has the proper skillset, drive, communication skills, and initiative to promote the growth and outreach that is known to be very crucial and necessary for the project\u2019s community.\n\nDuring this trial, certain metrics and goals must be minimally met in order to pass and continue into full employment.\n\n\u2014\n\n-> These metrics and goals will be established by the community if this proposal passes. <-\n\n\u2014\n\nThe community also requested there will be a monthly report of all Slice has done in this position. This report will be self-generated and is fully dependent upon Slice to produce. It will consist of all attempted outreach and growth initiatives AND all that were delivered. Everything that was done will be logged in order to promote full transparency to the community.\n\n\u2014\n\nIf all goes well within the trial and later down the road shortcomings begin to appear:\n\nIf Slice is not delivering on what has been set out within this proposal, then he may be removed from this position at any time by a community sponsored governance proposal. Additionally, the core team can cancel this position or remove slice from this position at any time without a vote.\n\n\n\n----------------------\u2014-----\u2014 VOTING OPTIONS ------------------------\u2014\n\n#1: Approve\n\nMeaning you approve this proposal to take Slice on as a Community Lead with the conditions set within the Proposal and allocation of Shard monthly.\n\n#2: Decline\n\nMeaning you disagree with this proposal and do not want it to pass.\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\nThis vote will require 5% of the circulating Shard supply to vote APPROVE (around 845,000 Shard to vote APPROVE) to reach quorum and to be higher than those that DECLINE;", "choices": ["Approve", "Decline"], "start": 1630951200, "end": 1631573940, "snapshot":
