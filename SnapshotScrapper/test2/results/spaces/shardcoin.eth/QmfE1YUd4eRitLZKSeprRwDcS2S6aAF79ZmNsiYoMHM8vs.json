{"id": "QmfE1YUd4eRitLZKSeprRwDcS2S6aAF79ZmNsiYoMHM8vs", "title": "In-agreement Check - Slice Community Lead Shard Allocation", "body": "**Proposal**\n\nThis proposal is in regard to establishing the community member Slice as a Community Lead for the Infinity Crypto/Shard community.\n\n--\n\nThe writers of this proposal strongly believe that in order to promote a healthy and growing community there needs to be a few essential roles with obligations fulfilled on a daily basis:\n\n--\n\n1.) The Community Organizer role will consist of:\nManaging the community with regular user engagement, discussion, and events to strengthen the community bond;\nCreating content and maintaining a knowledge base within the community;\n\n**\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014---------------MAIN FOCUS ----------------------\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014**\nDeveloping new ways to attract and grow activity within Discord, Telegram, and across other social channels;\n**\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014---------------MAIN FOCUS ----------------------\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014**\n\nPromoting and assisting all other community members to explore and seek out any initiatives and ideas they have.\n\n--\n\n**\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014---------------MAIN FOCUS ----------------------\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014**\n2.) The Community Marketing Manager role will consist of:\nFinding ways to bring new value and growth to Shard via non-paid marketing initiatives including:\nReaching out, building, and finding potential partnerships;\nDiscovering ways to bring further exposure and growth to Shard without funds or relying on community members;\nWorking with the core team to find new ways to bring growth and adoption to Shard via paid marketing initiatives, utilizing the community fund and other available funds.\nOrganizing the community for shilling and advertising initiatives;\nOrganizing community fundraising (with the management of funds by the Core Team);\nDirecting the community on where to focus efforts for advertising;\nSupplying information on how to effectively market as a community member.\n**\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014---------------MAIN FOCUS ----------------------\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014**\n--\n\n3.) The Community Lead role will consist of:\nInterpreting technical information from the team and communicating it to the community in a way that even the most technological disinclined may understand.\n\n--\n\nAll three of these positions will be covered under the umbrella term of \u201cCommunity Lead\u201d that this proposal is advocating for Slice to be voted in to. \n\n--\n\nSlice\u2019s official work hours will be 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM EST Monday-Friday, working a minimum of 40 hours per week. However, he will make himself available outside of those hours as needed for meetings or on an as-needed basis. Slice may put in more hours per week outside of those scheduled hours at his discretion.\n\n--\n\nAdditionally, the Community Lead will receive a weekly payout of Shard from the treasury as a payment for his service as outlined below. Slice is requesting $550 USD worth of Shard each week (in accordance with his living expenses). This will not be a fixed rate of Shard because Slice does not want to be paid (for example) 500 Shard weekly now at less than $1 and still 500 when Shard is potentially worth $300 USD. He feels that is unfair. Slice will not receive any additional payment for exceeding his minimum weekly time commitment.\n\nSlice is well aware that receiving an income paid in Shard creates a negative selling pressure. Being a widely passionate supporter of Shard, he stated he will try his best to fund his bills as much as he can outside of Shard and the rest that he needs to rely on Shard he will trade OTC as much as possible until liquidity can support the sell pressure.\n\nThere will also be a maximum payout amount of 7,000 Shard. This is equivalent to if Shard were to lower to ~0.079$. This is to prevent too much of an absurd amount of Shard to be distributed to Slice\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Why this is needed**\n\nIt is very clear that with all great projects, there also must be a great community to support and push the project to even greater heights than ever before. Infinity Crypto/Shard has the fundamentals, however the community is currently small and tight knit. It is not nearly strong enough at its current status. In order for the project to grow more quickly, we must find a way to expose this project to a larger audience, and thereby expand the community to include a greater number of individuals.\n\nSolidifying a Community Lead with the obligations of a Community Manager, and Community Marketing Manager will allow this individual to focus their pure efforts into developing the community and promoting growth and exposure while also retaining that new found audience with what this community can offer. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Negatives**\n- A small amount out of the 44 million Shard in the treasury will be dispersed each week as a payment to Slice for this position.\n- At CURRENT Shard prices, a relatively large amount (around 1.2% to 2%) of the Shard circulating supply would be needed to reach the $ value asked for one year of payment. -> This is assuming Shard does not change in value <-\n- Negative selling pressure as the Shard will mostly need to be sold for living expenses.\n\n\n **Positives**\n- The community will have a full time community manager, community marketing manager, and a community lead.\n-  The Community Lead can focus full time on community organization and marketing, as well as leading new initiatives to further expand and grow Shard.\n- Individuals that have key ideas for the community will have assistance by the Community Lead to realize these goals.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Final words**\n\nSlice is the perfect candidate for this position because he has already shown that he can and will fulfill all the requirements and obligations that are needed in order to satisfy the needs of this community. If we are able to secure this position for him, he will be able to focus his efforts full time toward community growth and community oriented marketing. He will be able to assist motivated and involved individuals and all will benefit from having him inducted into this position.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Terms of employment continuation**\n\nThe community has requested there be a 30 day trial wherein Slice demonstrates he displays he has the proper skillset, drive, communication skills, and initiative to promote the growth and outreach that is known to be very crucial and necessary for the project\u2019s community. \n\nDuring this trial, certain metrics and goals must be minimally met in order to pass and continue into full employment. \n\n\u2014\n\n-> These metrics and goals will be established by the community if this proposal passes. <-\n\n\u2014\n\nThe community also requested there will be a monthly report of all Slice has done in this position. This report will be self-generated and is fully dependent upon Slice to produce. It will consist of all attempted outreach and growth initiatives AND all that were delivered. Everything that was done will be logged in order to promote full transparency to the community.\n\n\u2014\n\nIf all goes well within the trial and later down the road shortcomings begin to appear:\n\n**If Slice is not delivering on what has been set out within this proposal: **\n\nSlice may be removed from this position at any time by a community sponsored governance proposal. Additionally, the core team can cancel this position at any time without a vote or remove Slice from this position at any time without a vote.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVoting Option Key: \n\n#1: Approve\n- Meaning this in-agreement vote is approved to move on to an official governance vote and you agree with taking Slice on as an official community Community Lead.\n\n#2: Decline\n- Meaning you disagree with this proposal and do not want it to pass to an official governance proposal.\n", "choices": ["Approve", "Decline"], "start": 1629804600, "end": 1630088520, "snapshot": "10306968", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2BBff0f932bD330E32202ecc93069b709CE9dB8f", "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth", "name": "Shard"}, "votes": 21, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYNaifU8giSKJtPsgngd546jz6ZqzBhq5oV76rtD5nnQg", "voter": "0x2BBff0f932bD330E32202ecc93069b709CE9dB8f", "created": 1630088079, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma1V5cjtCM7nzpBTnDL5Ydvjd68RttfcB9h2MDmYAphJW", "voter": "0x41e0e64554eAC0617Ae81193e696689264411215", "created": 1630065212, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYyVCFAwEfEYXmFFffX8pGZU6XmXeSeA1vFhxTddrfPGn", "voter": "0x33cC9CD921F3D3f56f7818b4d788cEcad02E9EEc", "created": 1630065168, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeJN8TTd2joHN52fdPY68E73TQzfchV7KMaMdbp2xhbay", "voter": "0x5A6AC03Eb30fd024297A921C636f1737092809B2", "created": 1629915949, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWDuneMUPeg25ZQAea4A5jGXzd7BGU9c9VhYfgbTqNWYz", "voter": "0x87eAF662e72e929e64DA99059f55D2A6E29097A0", "created": 1629892643, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPPptdZvv8TgQXKLc13JH68BwNkpYrypVVM6RvAR3skqV", "voter": "0x2Facf5620b9e818FC1BD9451323915C23a69ec46", "created": 1629892019, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ7doTJHRjERig52oEq86Rkmr1i1jeTfnWyxDPPGV7vFM", "voter": "0x73B4d3004DC4E642797eCAc5aA0bA7EA7a8BE780", "created": 1629860903, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSVNeWmtcwfyFcPGJqfbvBzhbgTPQnUympS76iRVxixV5", "voter": "0x99BF9c10d8585450e90D7fb583bDDAE15ab2237a", "created": 1629852610, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQG5tDjFoYzGMJFvceHaaGcWeP65aSpKLeatFjQZdEkmk", "voter": "0x3160ACA4a250D4d83f80058b33B691cC0AC10eF6", "created": 1629845070, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb617AApP1bjD9gUy7YaovohH766UsLdkyZfbNYuS3HuL", "voter": "0x04f7a8f12f49b88c1BB9Bad4B479BEE204Ed15D5", "created": 1629824463, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmecjKp6hVuVYgEkXfgj2FC6BBeNKwkTbyaSjfVSjEGr9o", "voter": "0x16bd97440BFF0eBed7b6817C0D6560152E9E9f2C", "created": 1629817277, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeQFeSfZtF4GwCtkE9yuPKvLRqADW9uGoABwgbor18GVC", "voter": "0xA15a7B2D56dC572f66846f04E46C21A4fa6374dC", "created": 1629816814, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbUHYLAWjRM1wrybzadLSdfsRaZXx6hvpiNzgp2YaB8b1", "voter": "0x02e5A992e308467D0050cF9f880278858dca222F", "created": 1629816479, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaA3PjkNch7vJZVFqEZoKvKpMAaLU9H9NzkK4W2sJsko9", "voter": "0xE40CA0a782b37E150eB2b4fe675e632B44Ed9C65", "created": 1629814358, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ3Wxt3yhfaukxSs7pCxeq8XuxazFoX54QT4rUXkr6ymd", "voter": "0x3694995Fbc41299f719F7BdAE6aCcDc6D5c78574", "created": 1629812688, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXvs4YgXNGvQKbCJ9oYrRer1M14wyvtpg2Nfs7yqRKXpF", "voter": "0xB9Db65ff6fa5aFB0b09927DA82c0CC10e2bAE0d1", "created": 1629811695, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPQeFqJrp9PSwxFniNkMzQguHAk2WCD2gEMPW5BYYKqSN", "voter": "0xCD68c99e07743bf820aBd6387CADf37E26A6D06B", "created": 1629806273, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSZvJg9S7rPA9rb6QzVQA5LwRmKZHpi3CHqc9qJ9BruD5", "voter": "0x2130FD01026867A6c8DdE24ad5E64F2e2DFce196", "created": 1629805508, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW5jEGczvFDocZf6jC7NcySmaJi4renLfkre4HjfrFtYT", "voter": "0x1725C561562899DF4271d08a8F2C0c04881d9d1a", "created": 1629805398, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYEQ3vr27pMMFGndnD2WW1cKyxLztgitMvowJguqqn5ft", "voter": "0x50D1f8c076e28832e237368887a1277c5683573e", "created": 1629805369, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUZL1BRQH9DXZ2jrcB8HUfRUBc8h9pAaNGhMFwd1fbx2J", "voter": "0x50F5e44B1691bE52513A44552c6f11A23AFd958F", "created": 1629805293, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "shardcoin.eth"}}]}
