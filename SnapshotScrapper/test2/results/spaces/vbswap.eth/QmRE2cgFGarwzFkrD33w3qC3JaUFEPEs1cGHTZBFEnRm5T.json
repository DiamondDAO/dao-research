The remaining 4500 vBSWAP will be compensated as following:\n\nOption 1:\nMint 4500 vBSWAP to compensate all affected users immediately.\nThis action could be done swiftly by the dev team without causing more workload, allowing us to continue working on important tasks at hand.\n\nOption 2:\nMint 2250 vBSWAP to compensate right away. The remaining balance of 2250 vBSWAP will be minted to refund the contract in 3 months. A snapshot will be taken of every affected user in the vStake profit-sharing pool. After the snapshot is taken, all affected users will be able to claim their missing vBSWAP via the refund contract weekly.\nThis option will require some work for the dev team so it might delay current workload.\nFor both options: After the mint, the subsequent vBSWAP accumulated by the Reserve Fund will be burned over the next 6 months. At which point the extra 4500 vBSWAP will be completely burned, reducing the supply back to normal.\n\nAll vBWAP holders at vFarm, vStake and vSafe will be able to vote. \n", "choices": ["Option 1: Save effort for team", "Option 2: Give them more work"], "start": 1620381600, "end": 1620468000, "snapshot": "7240000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x83833B4C6d9D408964feeF57624C3a726bD124D0", "space": {"id": "vbswap.eth", "name": "vBSWAP"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
