Current process of voting is making things too slow as every proposal requires 12 hours of voting at least (and not factoring time to raise the initial proposal + potential revisions.\n\nThis proposal empowers BigPPDAO to set up an Executive Team structure where the teams own the respective areas of work and have the autonomy to make decisions. Teams will be incentivised to act in the best interest of the BigPPDAO. This proposal also discusses potential clauses that may arises and our dispute resolution.\n\n# Team Structure\n\nBigPPDAO should move to a system where we have a Executive Teams that will work on the initiatives that the BigPPDAO believes will be beneficial for the DAOs. The Executive Team will be governed by the Non-Executive Governance Team, which is responsible for the main treasury reserve. \n\n## Executive Team\n\nThe teams will be incentivised and empowered to make the best decision possible for the DAO. Executive Team have the power to make all decisions related to growth in the verticals, and BigPPDAO members may enquire about the progress and justification about the actions made.\n\nWe will start with three executive teams:\n* Gaming Guild: Focus on revenue-generating strategies from play-to-earn games such as Axie\n* BigPP NFT Originals: Focus on selling our BigPP Originals NFT and pursuing the roadmap promised\n* Investments: Grow the fund size of BigPPDAO through investments\n\nTeams may receive either a fixed stipend, performance bonus (based on profits) or both. The exact incentivisation mechanism varies by teams and will be separately discussed in future proposals.\n\n## Non-Executive Governance Team\n\nThe non-executive team will consist of five (5) members who will also be the multisigs in the BigPPDAO.\n\nThe Non-Executive members will be responsible for:\n- Protect the treasury by setting checks and balance for responsible use of funds;\n- Ensure governance process is fair and proposals are adhered to\n\nNon-Executive members may hold concurrent role in Executive Teams, but they should not be signing on transactions that affect their own team. For example, the team lead of Investment Committee should not sign transaction that allocates additional fund limits to their sub-teams.\n\n## Term\n\nEvery team is expected to submit a summary of their work and progress every thirty (30) days.\n\n# Dispute Resolution\n\nAs teams have autonomy over the decisions which they are responsible for, it may not be aligned with every single person in the BigPPDAO's beliefs and values. \n\nShould any member of the BigPPDAO be unhappy with the decisions made by the Executive Teams,\n1. first feedback to the core team member first. \n2. If the issue is too large or core team member is irresponsive, then the member of BigPP can raise a proposal and solicit votes from BigPPDAO members.\n\nIn such a proposal, the proposer must explain what he/she believes that the core team has failed in responsibility. He/she should also give suggestion on who they think should replace the responsibilities that the core team member has given. \n\nBigPPDAO members have the option to exit the DAO anytime with a 10% administration fee (see next section).\n\n###  Premature Exits\n\nIn the event that a BigPPDAO member believes that there is a serious value misalignment or has different investment thesis, he/she should be able to exit the DAO anytime.\n\nExit rates = (% Share in DAO) * Value of the DAO\n\nAs premature exits creates additional administration work for core team and multisigs and affects the operations of the DAO, the DAO will charge a 10% fee on premature exits.\n\nTo prevent ambiguity, consider this scenario. John has 20k BigPP token. He represents 5% of the entire BigPPDAO supply. The current value of assets in DAO is $500,000. If John prematurely exits, he will receive 5% of $500,000) * 0.9 = $22,500 from the treasury. John's BigPP token will then be burned and John will be removed from BigPPDAO discord and telegram group.\n\n## Related future proposals\n\nIf passed, individual or teams could write a proposal to nominate themselves for the teams.\n\nTeams or individuals interested in running for the sub-teams must propose a justification on why he/she is qualified, how much time he will spend on the growth strategies of the DAO, budget required and performance fee.\n\n## What is not covered by this proposal\nThe following points will not be covered in this proposal:\n* Payout and performance fee\n* Team composition\n* Strategies to be employed by the team\n\nBigPPDAO structure:\n- https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rL385Gz8AQvmPYSomWAWRjHoyadTJY-Nzlmv1Tz9oIU/edit#slide=id.geaafb491a1_5_0\n\n\n# What is covered by this proposal\n\nBy agreeing to this proposal, you agree to:\n- Delegate day-to-day decision making to the best judgement of the team leads;\n- Be polite with enquiries about decisions that the team leads\n- Keep disputes and arguments within BigPPDAO. Let's first resolve issues internally.\n", "choices": ["Agree", "Disagree"], "start": 1629464400, "end": 1629529200, "snapshot": "18189955", "state": "closed", "author":
