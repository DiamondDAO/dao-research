Due to the fact that Biswap wants to become a benchmark for all the DEX platforms on the market, the team has to make decisions that will definitely help the project reach its goals.\u00a0\n\nA lot of work has already been done and various achievements have already been achieved. And now it\u2019s the time for another milestone for Biswap. It\u2019s the time for change that will give a HUGE boost for the future of Biswap.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBiswap team is currently in talks with a huge crypto investment company that is willing to invest in the project and continuously assist in bringing Biswap to the new heights. This deal requires significant BSW token resources. \n\nDue to the fact that all the tokens are now distributed across the pre-defined pools, the management team of Biswap has to make the changes to the current tokenomics and create a separate pool for the Biswap investors. The only way to have this pool created is to derive a certain percentage from the existing pools.\u00a0\n\n# What Are the Benefits for the Community?\u00a0\n**The list of potential benefits our investor might bring is:**\n\n&#128525; Community expansion\u00a0\u2028\n&#128525; Brand awareness\u2028\n&#128525; More partnerships with well-known DeFi projects \u00a0\u00a0\u2028\n&#128525; Token price growth\u2028\n&#128525; Worldwide exposure\u00a0\u2028\n&#128525; Support from the top players on the market\u00a0\u2028\n\n**Once we close the deal, Biswap will immediately disclose the name of the investor.**\n\nBiswap would not have been able to achieve such magnificent results without our community. The opinion of every user is extremely crucial to our team and our users have always been an integral part of the development of the project. \n\nGiven this vision, we cannot make such changes without the approval of our beloved family members. Hence, we invite every user of Biswap to join this community voting and support the team with its beneficial proposal.\u00a0\n\n**Let\u2019s help Biswap grow with a furious speed!**\n\n### **Here are the proposals:**\nYou can vote for any of the following two options:\u00a0\n\n## \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 Option 1: Improve the tokenomics and help the project rapidly grow\u2028\n- 80.7% - Farms & Launchpools\u2028\n- 4.3 % - Referral Program\u00a0\u2028\n- 5 % - Investment Fund\n- 1% - SAFU (Security Asset Fund for Users)\u2028\n- 9% - Team\u00a0\u2028\n&nbsp;\n## \u274c Option 2: Keep the tokenomics as it is.\u00a0\u2028\n - 85.7% - Farms & Launchpools\u2028\n - 4.3 % - Referral Program\u00a0\u2028\n - 1% - SAFU (Security Asset Fund for Users)\u2028\n - 9% - Team\u00a0\u2028\n\n## Please note\nIn case the community approves our proposal, all the changes to the tokenomics will be made only after closing the deal with our potential investor.\n\n## Terms & Conditions\u00a0\n- The voting period is 7 (seven) days.\u00a0\u2028\n- The choice that will accumulate more than 51% of votes or exactly 51% will win the voting.\u00a0\u2028\n- Once voted, you will not be able to vote again.\u00a0\u2028\n- There is no need to unstake your BSW tokens from Farms and/or Launchpools to vote.
