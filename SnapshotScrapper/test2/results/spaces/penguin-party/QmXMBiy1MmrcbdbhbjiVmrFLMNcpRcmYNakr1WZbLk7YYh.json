{"id": "QmXMBiy1MmrcbdbhbjiVmrFLMNcpRcmYNakr1WZbLk7YYh", "title": "#4 - CommonWealth Generation Event", "body": "I have invented a new defi lego I call a CommonWealth Credit, based on the aToken standard.\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x26780078e07cc33f0323df626f42fa92971561d4\n\nIt employs the same methodology of shrimp and crab and imposes a commonwealth tax that can be set by the community.\nIt also redirects it's interest stream to a community-designated address.\n\nIt is currently set to .2% and it's fee is targeted to my address.\n\nI have experimented with these three tokens (Shrimp, Crab, and Commonwealth Credits) and I have shown they do in fact generate revenue which will be useful to the organization and beneficial to holders of fish.\n\nI have minted the first several hundred dollars worth of an aDAI backed Commonwealth credit and created several liquidity pools for it tied to \ud83d\udc1f and ETH.\n\nI propose that having a decentralized commonwealth stablecoin could be advantageous to our community for a variety of reasons, such as for paying developers in a predictably valued token instead of simply \ud83d\udc1f.\n\nAs well, the CommonWealth lego is compatible with any other aToken, we could for example, have an aLINK, aMANA, or aETH Commonwealth coin.\n\nThis proposal has several riders which I will detail with bullet points.\n\n- Set Shrimp, Crab, and CommonWealth V1 DAI fees to .1%\n\n- Set Shrimp, Crab, and Commonwealth fee destinations to a new address controlled by me (Hiturunk.eth) to be used as a petty cash address in lieu of the multisig.\n\nThis will seperate commonwealth fees from my personal address, but allow me to retain temporary and flexible control of the fees for the benefit of the community. ( I don't think my cofounders want to have to meet every day to distribute taxes to OG's or similar, I ask that you trust me to retain this power temporarily)\n\n- Allocate 5,000 fish from the treasury to be escrowed by Hiturunk for the purpose of generating initial commonwealth liquidity: 2,500 fish will be sold OTC at spot price to any interested party to raise aDai to mint Commonwealth Credits. (If no interested party presents itself, I will return the fish to treasury.)\n\nThe other 2,500 fish will be liquidity pooled against the commonwealth credits and the shares will be sent to the treasury.\n\nAs well, several members of my core development team are deserving of a payment for the services they have provided to the project and I think it is in the community's interest to continue to engage them with a payment of fish. These developers have done amazing things on the project and we couldn't have made it here without them:\n\n-  Allocate 200 fish from the treasury to Pooryia for designing our logos and backgrounds for penguinswap, and for his continued work in the project.\n\n- Allocate 200 fish from the treasury to cComp for his continued work on the PWA-compatibility of Penguinswap and integrations advisement.\n\n- Allocate 200 fish from the treasury to Ncitron for his continued work on the Unigov dApp and usability fixes on penguinswap.\n\n- Allocate 100 fish from the treasury to community member GIOCR for his work on mobile compatibility for the Unigov dApp.\n\nTOTAL EXPENDITURE: 5,700\nCore team payments: 700 fish\nPooryia: 200 fish,\ncComp: 200 fish,\nNcitron: 200 fish\nGiocr: 100 fish\nLiquidity Generation (Hiturunk as escrow):  5,000 fish\n\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No", "Other: Respecify Proposal"], "start": 1605290400, "end": 1605549600, "snapshot": "11249376", "state": "closed", "author": "0x0be0eCC301a1c0175f07A66243cfF628c24DB852", "space": {"id": "penguin-party", "name": "\ud83d\udc27Penguin Party Fish\ud83d\udc1f "}, "votes": 14, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYsjQuENjwVQkDDHdnmJm3En4aDwDUcxUWsaNixtFyCoA", "voter": "0xb285037347daEfcbd1470F8fB0C37E0d4af4Fd44", "created": 1605481663, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "penguin-party"}}, {"id": "QmYT4GQA2mAmbyb8n5dqnXqonPqPbyFxh8msWbJXMhZsQm", "voter": "0x92A0b2C089733beF43Ac367D2CE7783526AEA590", "created": 1605455278, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "penguin-party"}}, {"id": "QmTPj7AcCDVRi7Y7bNwB43YKvMZfUqL13RcsM3iqxZpS5p", "voter": "0xE36BD8C15a83b89E2E49806d7312846069755C63", "created": 1605452940, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "penguin-party"}}, {"id": "QmedfcRhPSsixtEEFsEeywumah1pgxLLR2XELyTK9R925R", "voter": "0xFB40932271Fc9Db9DbF048E80697E2Da4AA57250", "created": 1605452915, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "penguin-party"}}, {"id": "QmT89kLHcb7D83ivgALrc5hiJqJrP39bV8cSrzD44dJx2o", "voter": "0xc58B775068B8B55e64BbD0936a16a85C1f2d2D47", "created": 1605433614, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "penguin-party"}}, {"id": "QmXwumxVLJxhi4io8xA1o4uh6So1Zw5XBqfpNJLhFkrgH9", "voter": "0xf6D53DE9f9f4C09B094ef9d4011B304C69b9f567", "created": 1605394317, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "penguin-party"}}, {"id": "QmPuq2cFndP5tw9yvhJmybhfQc8CpB7egs4EpHZwgmW51e", "voter": "0xA5364626190f3E3106a9031170f35d61C3072342", "created": 1605386577, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "penguin-party"}}, {"id": "QmWbXK5vWLzkNFcNvztsf5jFmMqQGiariHwwyCyFEy4Gs2", "voter": "0xBb13b42C5b1c0771c08a358e2C87c47013cD6ebf", "created": 1605372207, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "penguin-party"}}, {"id": "QmYhRErgqzcVce8mXXB9n9toue4wwfwThfmXV25TKPRfxF", "voter": "0x78C5Dc062a541dAE7AeC891575B8e66321EeC848", "created": 1605362188, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "penguin-party"}}, {"id": "QmbbSzXBtVc2Gy5YD8WAmz8MCYotPd1rprGTBpsCEzD7FD", "voter": "0xD3Fd32e76a1cA37eC408aAc47776b10Fc099F841", "created": 1605345931, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "penguin-party"}}, {"id": "QmUu5DUtv78kCThEc5H6WqF4zygPXnzAJsGsUoDeWq6jmp", "voter": "0xA180bA7d5a7aA29B5F87f97D583D763CFA36d6B2", "created": 1605345006, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "penguin-party"}}, {"id": "QmRokdgDKgS2CrPSc4QnFN155p5UGApekX1UH2isZ79DFY", "voter": "0x98B71b68336D4BfBB9e7D5996C22faE901b01587", "created": 1605341544, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "penguin-party"}}, {"id": "QmRG5q6Mv3y25RXRdfqJRhUunAWrdXWKrKkAbCgX9JmuJ3", "voter": "0x6CED59A8D2dA7bdf3E6c2920F632421A8f3c34D1", "created": 1605329573, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "penguin-party"}}, {"id": "Qmbh7BDkcNkunRSLXH5hxcgeeAKHDrzSWt3xBrwP85VjA1", "voter": "0x79411510315e819A36a731aA384C866a1dbA2806", "created": 1605295485, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "penguin-party"}}]}
