After a successfull poll the holders elected out of the extensive list provided are Kiwi, Lex Moskovski, and Chickenpie347\n\nWith a positive snapshot vote, these 3 candidates by votes would be ratified as the official community multi-sig keyholders. \n\nWe would like to thank everyone on this list for their support to the ecosystem, and willingness to actively participate in treasury operations.\n\nPS: Considering most of the community members have locked their SWRV in preparation for on-chain votes, this proposal uses Block 10,886,360 (same as SIP-10, SIP-12) for SWRV snapshot so everyone can vote the SWRV they held earlier prior to locking.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1601346000, "end": 1601497200, "snapshot": "10886360", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1C802B1f27ACD3a3Def732899fd1F4c61FE30DD8", "space": {"id": "swerve", "name": "Swerve"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNZ4MxtSXRjF3txCkgwfSAQRA83r1JrW27vb4chgoYcd1", "voter": "0x323889BE384BcdFC53F941789dD004E8a0746a27", "created": 1601456244, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "swerve"}}, {"id": "QmWdmCd7ZR52N18ymukGzMh2HhsSXgUvm4h4UVMh72sQzj", "voter": "0xe1163DCFb598F74da146a83CC878731d553abBfe", "created": 1601450848, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "swerve"}}, {"id": "QmSbBMuzHYVsSDuzTAJGAcH8RyKsdYiEsnDtUdBz8qa71V", "voter": "0xFa35187089b68A5cd2b9416D43De430b955C2B60", "created": 1601450819, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "swerve"}}, {"id": "QmaGU8FK26fr9PM3QUxb8B8ARdVWD3kZ8d3cuSfCy8ypFL", "voter": "0x83326cEC1aF49Ff85384E97F3cEb5B319bF5cf4C", "created": 1601439162, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "swerve"}}, {"id": "QmYpYiCLwrxHZTKQBQsK4kB3Nd25tW8ebMcbGxrXP87uq2", "voter": "0x0273659bB730c6a01CBF8D63ea98C7C446152B7E", "created": 1601418632, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "swerve"}}, {"id": "QmXspfMhBueWwGWKomyXgY6jfSEqGoZ52nHNfGNLYpjxat", "voter": "0x02e05dbBF4df5d17cb3A0140F9643fE68cc4Ae39", "created": 1601417096, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "swerve"}}, {"id": "QmaWjrbwF6EWcWBfMei56Y6D1BmwkyGdm3WLhkB43BG15d", "voter": "0xA4bd4E4D2e8c72720839823f6c20f411f7DDb1f1", "created": 1601415376, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "swerve"}}, {"id": "QmQ41no185hZTtKn5XuDcrzJ4Kq5YXEw7YdZUujwikfFag", "voter": "0x731D4AbF892696A2460d20B18cf31bF76baC1722", "created": 1601396357, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "swerve"}}, {"id": "QmW465e9YLR4TfWwGas7gtuHrn4QGVnQk8JxwCC55bqzkq", "voter": "0x23Be060093Db74f38B1a3daF57AfDc1a23dB0077", "created": 1601392966, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "swerve"}}, {"id": "QmWfDi5bDnzobGNxCjX17Dma36BhbWeJ5ykFUWLYDd5bWb", "voter": "0x71F12a5b0E60d2Ff8A87FD34E7dcff3c10c914b0", "created": 1601358466, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "swerve"}}, {"id": "QmVRcHZejn1zDNAYYBXpaHYbLXQ8aVDjXXEmNLFwSXG9qx", "voter": "0xEaa593aDE3570a12E9C68522BAE65278a45e41ec", "created": 1601354641, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "swerve"}}, {"id": "QmSbdqwvJfDu2GhyWWYEmtAnHKCzxP2ThbAtLAFkt7hj1p", "voter": "0x43eD1E7DfC1A25D7E15B439Fe3EC8008B4A95226", "created": 1601354495, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "swerve"}}, {"id": "QmVBSxp4q4kvTo3N2jZFfDgevhLgf8KQnDzwbneEK7xPuU", "voter": "0x81dcaF33Ac0aaa9D5F58eB20cDc81a38620d814f", "created": 1601348055, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "swerve"}}]}
