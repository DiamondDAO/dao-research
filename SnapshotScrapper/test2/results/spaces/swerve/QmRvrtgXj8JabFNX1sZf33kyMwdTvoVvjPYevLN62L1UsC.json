These are the most used 3 stablecoins in Defi, and make up the majority of demand for stablecoins. The reason they have requested this is that YFII do not currently accept TUSD as a deposit currency therefore cannot currently use the default swerve pool since it would expose them to TUSD risk.\n\nThose familiar with the ypool on curve by Yearn finance will have a good understanding of how this would be structured.\n\nThis would be a good way to bring more AUM under swerve, currently YFII has 50m AUM that can be brought under swerve with this integration.", "choices": ["Yes - Creation of iPOOL - USDT, USDC, DAI", "No - Status Quo"], "start": 1600430400, "end": 1600776000, "snapshot": "10884761", "state": "closed", "author": "0x58D7dadc00d3fb8e752BF599f7E7Cdb059C2E4Eb", "space": {"id": "swerve", "name": "Swerve"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNZEKLVVfVU3bgaaxWtDd5n95VRsFaafV5RtCXTZUn1ae", "voter": "0x357AD9662364AeD7316ACBdbC76A193983E7c731", "created": 1600452013, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "swerve"}}]}
