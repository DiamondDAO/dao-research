wars are good, peace is bad.\n\n# Implementation\n* This would require a redeployment of Gauge Weight Controller with proposed modification.\n* Andrew has proposed the following formula which would require only one state variable.\n```\ngw = c * gw + (1 - c) * lastGw\n```\nWhere:\ngw = gaugeweight\nlastGw = previous gauge weight\nc = free parameter\n\n**Discuss:**\nhttps://gov.swerve.community/t/sip-14-beyond-gauge-weight-wars/97\n\nPS: Considering most of the community members have locked their SWRV in preparation for on-chain votes, this proposal uses Block 10,886,360 (same as SIP-10, SIP-12, SIP-9-T4) for SWRV snapshot so everyone can vote the SWRV they held earlier prior to locking.", "choices": ["Yes -
