This has helped attract ~$400mn worth of liquidity leading to ~$20mn worth of trading volume on a single pool. This is way more liquidity than is needed for this trading volume. cf. Curve has almost the same daily trading volume as liquidity in many of their pools. Swerve has 10-20 times more liquidity than trading volume.\n\nIt would be better for Swerve to add more trading pairs that are not covered today and use the current time-limited extreme SWRV issuance to incentivise those pool(s).  Additional trading pairs would attract new customers and incremental trading volume. This would be a much better use of the current very aggressive SWRV issuance than overloading the single pool with liquidity.\n\nsUSD is the second most traded pool on Curve so Swerve should add this as the second pool, post-haste.", "choices": ["Set up DAI, USDC, USDT, sUSD pool ASAP", "Set up new pools later, after SWRV issuance has fallen."], "start": 1599480000, "end": 1599566400, "snapshot": "10821876", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB2C5973EAE6c2a8e5803Aa9A3e0cb177aFE11CDe", "space": {"id": "swerve", "name": "Swerve"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
