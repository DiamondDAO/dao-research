The tax is collected as revenue of protocol and sent to the system treasury, starting from the system launch. Till now the treasury has collected a remarkable quantity of tax. At the time of governance launch, the system will burn this part of the income as a universal reward for all Zerogoki asset holders.\n\nAfter the REI stake function launch, the tax generated for every mint/redeem transaction will be transferred to the reward pool, REI stakers will constantly receive protocol income and share the growth with the system.\n\nB.Asset holders have two methods to participate in governance.\n\n1. Stake REI in xREI Pool\nxREI is an interesting bearing token and stands for voting rights. 1xREI =1 vote. xREI has a dynamic convert ratio with REI which is determined by tax income level. xREI withdrawal has a 21-day lockup period. When a user applies to withdraw REI (with redeeming xREI at the same time), the earning distribution will pause and after 21 days his REI can be claimed. xREI is also a tradable asset.\n\n2. Lock REI-USDT LP in governance pool\nREI-USDT LP holders need to lock their LP for 21 days to get their voting rights. The amount of LP which is equal value with 1 xREI, equals 1 vote.\nYou may use the snapshot page to upload new proposal and vote with xREI\uff0820xREI minimum\uff09: https://snapshot.org/#/zerogoki.eth\n\nC.How to be a participant in REI governance for now\nOnly xREI holders are eligible to propose and vote in Zerogoki governance since we are in the first period of governance completion. Get your xREI on zerogoki.org.\n\nHolders with more than 20 xREI can submit a proposal on the Zerogoki snapshot page. Only when the amount of votes is higher than the amount of 5% circulating xREI can pass through.\n", "choices": ["Yea", "Nay"], "start": 1630036800, "end": 1632801600, "snapshot": "13113801", "state": "closed", "author": "0x59a1626b878A5A00AEaA3cFDc49B0B65B2Baf266", "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth", "name": "Zerogoki"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmbSbrjygzTfvWkEvk9WPuVB26ohvyGjJKzBoF7tsteteF", "voter": "0xe7E833730a01f53E4F4F8CDD93027beD809D10EE", "created": 1631515211, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf7StU824Ns6cex26Rdzw4rfKGXAG1v3ydjYKBmG3zqkJ", "voter": "0xdE87541D9D34E8643a5AeeAA6C68C2De23881EF0", "created": 1630153581, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTHhtBmEd56F56SxSb6zp8xdryV9eazQH6AN1eaDswAAz", "voter": "0xB8D8Ecb1335A6B9840AB46292c81719FEA38e088", "created": 1630153314, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXfYfwM9UeYfEJ5tCDVJru7kw3irv4vaRX3nFxS5oLGpF", "voter": "0x59a1626b878A5A00AEaA3cFDc49B0B65B2Baf266", "created": 1630152828, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth"}}]}
