We are considering moving liquidity on Zerogoki to an alternative DEX such as 1inch or Sushiswap.\n\nMotivation\nIn order to protect our users from the uncertainties and make sure that they can trade safely and smoothly on Zerogoki, we believe that Sushiswap would be the best alternative location to host the incentivized liquidity pools for ETH wrapped zAssets. \n\nTherefore, we propose to move to Sushiswap due to the following reasons:\n\n1. 1inch is becoming increasingly popular while still has less market recognition compared to Sushiswap in terms of market cap and 24h trading volume:\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/\nsushi:\nmarket cap: $1,159,772,232\nvolume: $446,049,828\n\n1inch:\nmarket cap: $419,481,369\nvolume: $320,607,853\n\n2. As the REI-USDT pool is the price source of REI, it is crucial to determine the pool to which LP providers are more willing to stake assets. 1inch is popular for its exceptional swap protocol, but it is not as good when it comes to the liquidity pool. As shown in the link(https://app.1inch.io/#/1/dao/pools\n), 1inch's liquidity pools with relatively higher liquidities are the ones associated to 1inch token. For example, ETH-1inch pool got total liquidity of $8,874,059, while the ETH-USDT pool has only $275,533 liquidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "choices": ["move to Sushiswap", "move to 1inch", "stay in Uniswap"], "start": 1625619600, "end": 1627617600, "snapshot": "12911469", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5A82F93a1AA956C0FF1C1818ed0A3F664A99cc91", "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth", "name": "Zerogoki"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTw5jh1jk1hjyYQWfyd2EN8jDCYnYEP2ECjAjteaT6kqV", "voter": "0xdE87541D9D34E8643a5AeeAA6C68C2De23881EF0", "created": 1627530293, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSuvJhGLNx6H4iE9Tn3GuUvaefTNoH42KP3yeYJPtLpJH", "voter": "0x48008fCb6413A28CA1d8154e72024402B5635c73", "created": 1627451649, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZiCbSer5rDabEMLq1ZZytW3XyhcfRpFVZCq25vnL7nbB", "voter": "0xF8FB3eA6D4Af20cCF7f461861c5D9FC21E090193", "created": 1627448757, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXuemh33WidgcbmzSqdLXcpssBX4MGtYS2kTJDpL3Up5v", "voter": "0x579f2FCE6B7D1ffEA323F73bF968ef4Ed94e09dE", "created": 1627448222, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYsZyFiHb8JmhctX9JsmF7UUPsZ2TWoXhUkQpknLPiwCJ", "voter": "0x5A82F93a1AA956C0FF1C1818ed0A3F664A99cc91", "created": 1627447621, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth"}}]}
