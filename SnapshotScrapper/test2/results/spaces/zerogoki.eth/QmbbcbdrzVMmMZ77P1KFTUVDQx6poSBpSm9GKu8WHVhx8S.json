But BSC and Polygon can have the Mint and Redeem function for their REI users to mint or redeem zAssets.\n\nBy implementing the above approach, liquidity will become better as well as Zerogoki tokens' utility.\n\nThe Mint/Redeem mechanism and tax rate should be also adjusted once the cross chain bridge is fully open and stabilized.", "choices": ["For REI only", "For REI and zUSD", "For REI and all zAssets", "Do NOT open the bridge"], "start": 1631800800, "end": 1632967200, "snapshot": "13240346", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB8D8Ecb1335A6B9840AB46292c81719FEA38e088", "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth", "name": "Zerogoki"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRpJnbSc8WrPE6t2KvatzY9xLQa47n2gcHYDBEkKP5dr4", "voter": "0x118ca5E9390208048088350B71D4EcE2463B6587", "created": 1632809658, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcsCTiEq9LJXKiR46cwtdWmuLpFcrJrVrypm4LkSWpduu", "voter": "0x16d21Bf03C9617875cb88cE7705C48f8aaa7A7e3", "created": 1631935566, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth"}}, {"id": "QmboPyqWvVcGbE31sNAE4GCvVjf1esH5mCaHXGQB49fi36", "voter": "0xB8D8Ecb1335A6B9840AB46292c81719FEA38e088", "created": 1631845291, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "zerogoki.eth"}}]}
