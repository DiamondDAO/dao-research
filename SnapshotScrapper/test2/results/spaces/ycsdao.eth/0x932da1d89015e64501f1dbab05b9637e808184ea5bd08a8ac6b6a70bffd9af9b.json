But our point of view is that the YCS needs a new strategy and an incentive system to achieve sustainable and durable growth.\n- Followed by the rapidly growing Metaverse and NFT market, we intend to broaden the Metaverse and P2E ecosystem that embody Yakuza Cat Society's worldview and characters as its killer content. (Not only Genesis and Gen 2 Yakuza Cats and also many elements will be included hereby; various equipment, strengthening status, pets, Yakuza wars between syndicates, Pachinko, combining with DeFi and Yakuza Land, and more.)\n\n# Objectives\n- In order to create and operate such a huge ecosystem of its size as a large-scale community like Axie Infinity or Sandbox, the following two conditions must be required.\n    - Large-scale financing\n    Because the sales of the existing Genesis Cat or the royalties coming in (and even from later on) alone are insufficient to achieve and sustain what we have for the goal, we are currently meeting with VCs who invested in Skymavis (Axie Infinity), and other game industry officials.\n    \n    - Long-term incentive system\n    In order to achieve sustainable growth and build a Play to Earn ecosystem and our own metaverse, an incentive system is essential for all stakeholders, including communities, teams, and investors, to motivate everyone to participate steadily in the long term according to the game theory.\n    \n- Hence, we propose a newly updated DAMA Tokenomics with a new incentive program as follows.\n\n# Specification\n### 1. Proposal of new Tokenomics including long-term incentives for the next 4 years.\n- Expand Total Supply to 1,000,000,000 DAMA\n  - Community Reward - 500,000,000 DAMA (50%)\n    - Staking - 300,000,000 DAMA (30%)\n    - Initial Reward - 26,780,000 DAMA (consumed up to Nov. 30th)\n    - Genesis NFT Staking - 130,378,000 DAMA (10 DAMA per NFT for 4 years)\n    - 2nd Gen NFT Staking - 130,378,000 DAMA (5 DAMA per NFT for 4 years, assuming all recruiting fees will be burned.)\n    - LP farming & DAMA Staking - 12,454,000 DAMA\n  - P2E Reward - 200,000,000 DAMA (20%)\n    - Lockup will be released step by step with launching our YCS metaverse.\n  - Ecosystem - 100,000,000 DAMA (10%)\n    - This will be used to set up the ecosystem afterward, including the marketing fund.\n    - The fund of 26,790,000 DAMA had been used to provide liquidity on Sushi Swap.\n  - Team - 200,000,000 DAMA (20%)\n    - This includes future step-up plans to expand the team on a larger scale.\n    - The Fund locked up will be linearly released for 4 years from January 1st, 2022.\n  - Investors - 200,000,000 DAMA (20%)\n    - This has been distributed in order to develop and operate our own metaverse and P2E ecosystem for the long term.\n    - The Fund locked up will be linearly released for 4 years from January 1st, 2022.\n\n### 2. New Incentive Program with Staking, not Claiming\n- The existing method of claiming has been chosen to save up the accumulated gas fee used when the rewarding period stands for 1 month.\n    However, if this proposal changes the rewarding process of DAMA to a 4 years long-term plan and staking are applied, even though it will be causing some gas fees initially, this method can gradually increase the efficiency of gas fees. (Also helping reduce supply).\n    - Genesis Yakuza Cats will be rewarded with 10 DAMA per day for 4 years.\n    - 2nd generation Yakuza Cats will be rewarded with 5 DAMA per day for 4 years.\n    - You can stake/unstake all your cats in a single transaction (Mind that gas fees will depend on the numbers), and claim all rewards in a single transaction efficiently.\n\n### 3. Discount & Burning Recruiting Fee\n  - The amount of the reward, which will be updated as of December, has been lowered as 1/10 of what was released for the month of November. It is designed to be most beneficial for the holders who have participated earlier in the community and to prevent an excessive supply of $DAMA. Therefore, the recruiting fee, highly relevant to the amount of rewarding $DAMA, is to be adjusted as follows:\n\n|Recruiting Time|Recruiting Fee|\n|---|---|\n|1|1200(600+600)|\n|2|2400(1200+1200)|\n|3|3600(1800+1800)|\n|4|6000(3000+3000)|\n|5|9600(4800+4800)|\n|6|15600(7800+7800)|\n|7|25200(12600+12600)|\n\nAll DAMA used for recruiting will be burned and will be constantly reducing the supply of DAMA.", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST"], "start": 1636531200, "end": 1636704000, "snapshot": "13587465", "state": "closed", "author":
