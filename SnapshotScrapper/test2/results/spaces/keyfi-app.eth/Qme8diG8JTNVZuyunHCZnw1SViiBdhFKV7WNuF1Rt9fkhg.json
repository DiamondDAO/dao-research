{"id": "Qme8diG8JTNVZuyunHCZnw1SViiBdhFKV7WNuF1Rt9fkhg", "title": "KEYFI Staking Deposit Fee Management", "body": "VIEW PROPOSAL HERE\nhttps://github.com/KEYFIAI/KIPS/blob/develop/KIPS/kip-2.md\n\n## Simple Summary\nIn order to support the implementation of the long term token economic model, we are proposing to manage the current deposit fees collect from the v2 staking contracts according to the methods described in this post: [KEYFI Token Economic Model 1/3](https://medium.com/keyfi-news/keyfi-staking-and-reward-pools-keyfi-token-economic-model-updates-part-1-3-f936020843b).\n\n## Abstract\nIf the proposal passes, we will follow the methods defined in the specifications including the burning of KEYFI tokens.\n\n## Motivation\nThe management of deposit fees will create a self-funding and self-sustaining mechanism for ongoing rewards. This will ensure that the foundations are in place for long-term community growth, and a fair allocation of the resources.  This will for the time being be implemented as a manual & community governed process.  If it is successful, the processes will be programmed into future v3 staking and kTokens smart contracts.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\nThe proposed actions for each deposit fee are below:\n\nFor KEYFI\n* 50% KEYFI Burned\n* 50% KEYFI sent to seed fund for new DEX LP pools\n\nFor KEYFI LP Tokens\n* 50% Sell the non-KEYFI token for KEYFI then all KEYFI is Burned\n* 50% Sell the non-KEYFI then send to seed fund for new DEX LP pools\n\nFor Network Native Token (ETH/BNB/MATIC etc.)\n* 50% Send to Gas Fund (Contract Deployments / KeyFiDAO Transactions / Testing Integrations etc.)\n* 50% Send to KeyFi Treasury / Dev Pool\n\nFor Non-KEYFI Token with Existing Pool\n* 50% Buy KEYFI and send it to the Reward Pool\n* 50% Send to KeyFi Treasury / Dev Pool\n\nFor Non-KEYFI Token without Pool\n* 50% Send to seed fund for new DEX LP pools\n* 50% Send to KeyFi Treasury / Dev Pool \n\n### Rationale\nThe proposal will create a long-term, deflationary, self-sustaining model for ongoing incentivization of KeyFi smart contract usage. The deposit fees which are burned will reduce the overall supply of KEYFI, while the other management processes will help the reward pool and prepare for a new DEX liquidity pool.\n\n### Technical Specification\nWithin 48 hours of a successful vote result, the team will manually execute the transactions required to follow the processes outlined above, including both the Ethereum and BSC deposit fee wallets.   \n\n### Test Cases\nThere are no test cases for this proposal.\n\n### Configurable Values\nThe values will follow what is defined in the specifications.", "choices": ["YES", "NO"], "start": 1628362800, "end": 1628535600, "snapshot": "12979350", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2a9aC1Cab57d80e5E3c4574330863d54Ae311C68", "space": {"id": "keyfi-app.eth", "name": "KeyFi"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWwRgr3o7LPLpDiBkdHQJ5MYFKSnJQwqyPTnpZB3pXgu8", "voter": "0x603fe5B135c218E32Fe73CB433993b33B387cD42", "created": 1628490298, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "keyfi-app.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWoaRxwhJdyrPvhVkecMrn3xanBHqUHQkRjoj12W6fqim", "voter": "0xBee4689d70B012dde8a577d34906cdac315e596E", "created": 1628423425, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "keyfi-app.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYJrcfs8n4EhHBc6Qmh3aKMaXZWmadp5gv7VVWMEkzkPi", "voter": "0xBa80a3b3E509468AA1b145A831a34162826D6Ec4", "created": 1628417193, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "keyfi-app.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT6tQbqtD6TUCjYeojKdJHQd4errePbsiYY6b9o52PzbB", "voter": "0xc15d7bF71a6FeE767a900471159475c011BB873b", "created": 1628417011, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "keyfi-app.eth"}}]}
