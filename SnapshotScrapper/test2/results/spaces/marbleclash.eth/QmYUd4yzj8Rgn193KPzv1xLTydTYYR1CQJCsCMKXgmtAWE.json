Therefore we would like to ask you as a part of the community which of the milestones you would like to see first.\n\nThat you can decide for yourself which possibilities and pitfalls there are, I will explain all possible steps first.\n\n- Improved interface design (includes mobile compatibility)\n- Different leagues with different rulesets\n- Focus on new players (demo decks, explainer videos, game wizard)\n\n Improved interface design (includes mobile compatibility)\n------\n\nAs you already know, MarbleClash was a spare-time project. I didn't do much conception and considerations just because of lack of time. The basic version of MarbleClash was built in two weeks and therefore it was only designed for the desktop (That we can simply play).\n\nBut with the support of MarbleCards / Meme.com, we now have much better possibilities. To make the whole game mobile compatible, the interface would have to be redesigned a bit. In the same course, the desktop version would be adapted in collaboration with a designer so that the mobile version and desktop version are in no way inferior to each other. The implementation would take a few weeks (I expect one or two months).\n\nDifferent leagues with different rulesets\n------\n\nSome players, especially beginners have difficulty winning at all. This of course takes the fun and this problem I will not just push aside. The goal of the game is that everyone gets their fun somewhere. The game should not become only Pay2Win system.\n\nOne solution would be to offer different rulesets. Rules that only allow certain cards and exclude for example Genesis or Origin cards. That means not, that for the big tournaments no more Genesis or Origin cards are admitted.\n\nIf the different rules are implemented, different leagues can be created in which 10 or 20 players play but then according to the fixed rules that this league has. This way different leagues can be provided that is fun for beginners and professionals.\n\n (I expect one month or less).\n\nFocus on new players (demo decks, explainer videos, game wizard)\n------\n\nThere are two possibilities for MarbleClash what this game should do. It should give existing MarbleCards users another way to have fun with MarbleCards or it should bring new players to MarbleCards.\n\nAchieving both goals at once is more of a balancing act and it makes more sense to focus on one goal.\n\nTo attract new players to the game some changes need to be made. When I'm new I don't want to spend $50 or $100 right away so I can play first. To solve this problem, demo decks would be a good solution.\n\nThese are decks that do not belong to the player but which can be used in a game. How exactly this looks like would have to be worked out. There could be videos about MarbleClash, MarbleCards ,and Meme.com so that the whole thing is easier to understand. In addition, a game wizard would make sense which guides the player piece by piece through the game.\n\nI.e. it would have to be worked out so that the onboard is much better. If the community decides to do this, I would write a new proposal that lists all the steps in detail.\n", "choices": ["Improved interface design", "Different leagues / rulesets", "Focus on new players"], "start": 1622876400, "end": 1623254400, "snapshot": "15353746", "state": "closed", "author": "0x471F2B55035a9cFDeC727Fd1F1838aF600234b16", "space": {"id": "marbleclash.eth", "name": "MarbleClash"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
