It would allow everyone to leave a request and to exchange tokens without the involvement of the other platforms. Furthermore, every user would be able to come up with its own sharing mechanism. By the way, although little known, there is a whole group in Telegram dedicated to it (the link is https://t.me/rariOTC). \n\n\nThe benefits of my idea are the following:\n->  considers a financial capability of all the users\n->  promotes the platform\n->  is easily implemented from coding perspective\n->  attracts users from other NFT platforms\n\n", "choices": ["Yes. Let's do it!!!", "No. It's not good idea:("], "start": 1618642800, "end": 1619247600, "snapshot": "12258835", "state": "closed", "author": "0x870c790867DA39B3692eEF6bE9fc0F46724a6574", "space": {"id": "rarible.eth", "name": "Rarible Protocol DAO"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmS7VH24tVCQnA56pBUen15RDi6HCrQnGbkaJmGdjsQLAS", "voter": "0x82248ff49f0C64c622cfa7b3607E7cEE97736f92", "created": 1618896890, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rarible.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR7MvskkoMVASV9eJzBrGDwGN3kpvNWStL6i2ZTTTX7h7", "voter": "0xA10Bae847159E0c96CC4d189Db950493415eF525", "created": 1618889883, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rarible.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXH1r4cioZ91HwADb39iPZ3KibcHyKtHHNajeNcTeaHGA", "voter": "0x117014D11395e96434705D633726953d816e03B3", "created": 1618680060, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rarible.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVBoj25hmBVK4Rgm2VN4hR52JZzLx8xoxLamfQ3iiiYuv", "voter": "0xE46DE55E43643204eaF7c102e034867002f7998b", "created": 1618680046, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rarible.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeV2g54BNcC7efe2SfGRDyzSZrxVaR4t4ZgyiCH8faG4K", "voter": "0x870c790867DA39B3692eEF6bE9fc0F46724a6574", "created": 1618680025, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rarible.eth"}}]}
