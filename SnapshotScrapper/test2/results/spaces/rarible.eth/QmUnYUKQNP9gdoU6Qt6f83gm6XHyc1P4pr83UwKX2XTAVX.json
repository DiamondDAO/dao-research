Deliverables will be at the end of every week. Fees for Component B will be assessed after 2 months.\n\nPayments will be made to the following Ethereum address: 0x283cC2177BC157708a5Ed19a53159185a18DBE78 (ERC20 - USDT)\n\nWe consider ourselves independent contractors of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly. Legal compliant invoices will be issued accordingly before funds get distributed to our team.\n\n### Use of funds\n\nA portion of these funds will be used for operations and infrastructure that includes transaction fees and contract deployment fees as well as the procurement of a server that can continuously handle marketplace support prediction requests, data aggregation and model training.\n\n### Team Members\n\n- Vijay Pravin Maharajan:\u00a0**Founder**.

Contact information is\u00a0[vijay@bitscrunch.com](mailto:vijay@bitscrunch.com)\u00a0and his Discord handle is\u00a0**[@Vijay](https://gov.rarible.com/u/vijay)**\u00a0| bitsCrunch#9613\n\n### Accountability\n\nWe\u2019ve developed a number of relationships with Rarible team members including Alex Salnikov, Eric Arsenault and Ethan van Ballegooyen. We will be working hand in hand for milestones eight through ten above. It\u2019s very important that the finished product adheres to Rarible\u2019s technical specifications. We will also work with community members to ensure updates are distributed through the Rarible communication channels.\n\n### Why should Rarible DAO fund this?\n\nWe\u2019re very interested to continue deploying AI-enhanced safety features in the NFT marketplace space \u2014 like the wash-trade detection & image forgery and provenance detection. While NFTs are more popular than ever, the most impactful way to strengthen the platform is with wash-trade detection and flagging models.\n\nIn our analysis of 1/3 of confirmed malicious trader wallets; 2.95 million $RARI tokens have been minted to addresses which were involved with malicious trading activity. This represents ~10% of the $RARI token distributions.\n\nOur goal is to reduce $RARI tokens rewarded to malicious actors. This will drastically increase platform trust by detecting and stopping wash trading in a manner that is fast, reliable and scalable. We also eliminate the manual effort of approximately\u00a0**8 hours per week**\u00a0of the support team.", "choices": ["Vote FOR", "Vote AGAINST"], "start": 1622574000, "end": 1623006000, "snapshot":
