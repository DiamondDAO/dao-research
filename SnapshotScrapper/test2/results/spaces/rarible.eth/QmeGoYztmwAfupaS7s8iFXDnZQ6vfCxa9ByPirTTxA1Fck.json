Our group has writers, graphic designers, animators, programmers, illustrators, game devs, geeks, crazy people and more. Artwork is literally our day job!\n\nWe do not intend to implement every one of these changes, so the mods can choose the best ones and make them available as convenient.\n\n1. Notifications!!! please have a better way to show notifications when someone follows me and likes my posts!\n\n2. Please create a space for DMs, People are doing it on twitter so why not just do it on Rarible.\n\n3. The cover image does not automatically switch size between tablet, phone and desktop. So some pages end up looking weird on some platforms. \n\n4. When uploading the picture their is a mistake 'updating' is spelt 'updading'\n(I am sorry if I am knitpicking but c'mon are'nt we trying to improve the platform?!!!)\n\n5. Check out our previous suggestion and think about making the verification faster for the reasons mentioned earlier. https://snapshot.org/#/rarible/proposal/QmYSV5A3p8ZuKs9GNmC6dwRDNut9xZzumTnnggnkH9Lcrw\n\n6. Have clear instructions for new artists. Let them know that unless they are not verified their artwork will not be displayed and they will not feature on the homepage nor will they pop up via search\n\nIf you read this far thank you for your time. Please vote!\n\nCheckout rawrnft.com for our NFTs", "choices": ["Implement all changes", "Implement some changes", "Do not implement any changes"], "start": 1618390800, "end": 1619773200, "snapshot": "12235459", "state": "closed", "author": "0xE7FD77FA021e2D290a745278005b4026E9671a44", "space": {"id": "rarible.eth", "name": "Rarible Protocol DAO"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVnfHrWQLMiu39ZTEWtWUvMfkgGQLk82o9kkZg6sZnTh8", "voter": "0xA10Bae847159E0c96CC4d189Db950493415eF525", "created": 1618429945, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rarible.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQVLFjkLzEMSXMzeLwbjJUzjjjQgpipV513xNVzzSijQL", "voter": "0x38dAEa6f17E4308b0Da9647dB9ca6D84a3A7E195", "created": 1618420916, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rarible.eth"}}]}
