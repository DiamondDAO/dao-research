The facts stay the same and I feel like funding should still be split between it so if you haven't already read the current one - make sure you do!\n\nSo the reason why I decided to create this revamp is due to the community speaking out for the fees. In the government channel, we agreed on a fee about 5% rather then 10% but people may still feel 5% for artists is a high fee. In regard to this, I'm making 3 choices that people can decide to and see if this holds more worth then the current choices. - Make sure to think about all parties then be bias when voting as RARI holders votes are VERY important.\n\n*Option 1* - Commission paid by buyers 2.5%, commission payed by sellers for primary sales 2.5%, commission paid by sellers for secondary sales 2.5%\n\n*Option 2* - Commission paid by buyers 3%, commission payed by sellers for primary sales 1.5%, commission paid by sellers for secondary sales 3%\n\n*Option 3* - Commission paid by buyers 2%, commission payed by sellers for primary sales 2%, commission paid by sellers for secondary sales 3.5%\n\nThese are not drastically big but I tried keep as unbiased as an artist can.", "choices": ["2.5% / 2.5% / 2.5%", "3% / 1.5% / 3%", "2% / 2% / 3.5%"], "start": 1600034760, "end": 1600430400, "snapshot": "0", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5a418d8bc0C074A4A8fa88d1322dc51Cc1cb9d29", "space": {"id": "rarible.eth", "name": "Rarible Protocol DAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
