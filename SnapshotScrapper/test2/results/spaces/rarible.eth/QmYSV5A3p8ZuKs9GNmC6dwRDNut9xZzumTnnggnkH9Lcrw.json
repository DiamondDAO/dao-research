{"id": "QmYSV5A3p8ZuKs9GNmC6dwRDNut9xZzumTnnggnkH9Lcrw", "title": "Speed up the verification process for all creators", "body": "Hello, \n\nWe are a group of creators from createbahrain.com, a company in the middle-east the provides creative projects and courses. Our group has writers, graphic designers, animators, programmers, illustrators, game devs, geeks, crazy people and more. We have created a universe of characters that turn buying, selling and bidding on NFTs into a game and all of our characters come with their own lore/story\nWe also update the lore of the universe on our website and instagram rawrnft.com\n\nNow, I believe that small groups of creators or individuals entering the business with rarible find it difficult to sell on the platform due to authenticity doubts. And while we firmly believe that verification is necessary due to alot of fakes using the platform to replicate others' works. We believe that it acts as a disincentive when the creator has to wait several weeks or even months before getting verified. \n\nIf the work is original then verification is a right. I also understand that this platform needs maintain scarcity and by verifying everyone, it will lose it somehow but we can up with other tags for that. \n\nLike I said its difficult to sell when we look fake despite how much efforts we exert on social media. \n\nAnother point to consider is that many groups pay a good deal of money to post on Rarible. In our case the total cost of making 9 NFTs was about 1k-1.5k. When considering how much work goes into our projects. We have a 3d dragon for gods sake!\n\nRarible could potentially lose good creators to other platforms who might consider a move when the verification takes so long. In order to make this the best community out there, we need to incentivize new creators who produce original works\n\nIf you read this far, thank you for your time.
