We are a community of artists exploring tools in the web3 and NFT space. We\u2019re working on being the go-to place for artists of all stripes to onboard into the vast and wonderful world of crypto. We aim to serve our community through education and community activities.\n\nOn April 22nd, we successfully fulfilled our first pilot project called the\u00a0#earthdaynft2021\u00a0campaign which was funded by the Rarible DAO. Working closely with Eric Arsenault and Rarible, this campaign proved to be a great success. Artists all over the world supported this campaign and confirmed the importance of community building among creators within the Rarible ecosystem.\n\nWe see the initial pilot as only the beginning. We are ready to launch longer-term initiatives and continue to serve the Creative community with engaging and interesting opportunities.\n\n### **Core Team:**\n\n**Nathalie Nunez** - Project and Campaign Lead\n\nFor over 20 years has been a Digital + Analog Arts Educator + Marketing Specialist. She has worked as a Teaching artist for various Visual Art centers, STEM Programs. She has also been a member of art collectives, ran community arts projects, and worked as a Brand liaison. She is passionate about creating connections and collaborative opportunities between IRL and the crypto world.\n\n**Mark Redito** - Project Manager and Artist Relations\nA professional musician, visual artist and content creator for over a decade. A big part of my work as an artist explores the intersection of art and emergent technologies. My experience and current projects includes: producing a podcast that explores art and technology intersections ([SIM/BIO/SYS](https://www.twitch.tv/sim_bio_sys)), project manager for music + web3 experiments ([Songcamp](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/)) and resident artist and dot connector for upcoming NFT platform ([MysteryDrop](https://github.com/MysteryDrop/mystery-drop)). I\u2019m passionate about exploring possibilities for artists/creators to further expand their expressions and offerings in the web3 space.\n\n### Below is our proposal to offer our services to the Rarible Creative Community.\n\nOverview on how we plan to serve the community:\n\n1. Create campaigns and competitions that engage the crypto-art community.\n2. Provide education and professional development opportunities.\n3. Curate and connect participating artists to companies and projects.\n4. Build partnerships with other crypto-creator communities and the wider digital art space.\n\nWe plan on integrating those key elements into the development of our upcoming campaigns. It\u2019s important for us as a collective to be able to thoughtfully iterate and adjust to the needs of the community. This is why we have built-in reflection, brainstorming, and planning into our timeline.\n\n**Project Outline:**\n\nEducational Content Series + Competition Campaign\n\nThis educational content hopes to engage the creator community and bridge the gap between crypto native and non-crypto native artists. By highlighting useful techniques/tips from artists that are innovators in their medium, we aim to provide learning opportunities for beginner and veteran artists alike. Our goal with this series is to inspire and educate as well as expand participating artists\u2019 engagement in the crypto sphere. We see this initiative as an opportunity to reinforce Rarible\u2019s mission to empower artists and the creator economy.\n\n**Video Breakdown**\n\n1. Each campaign will have an Interview with a featured Artist curated by the collective. This opens the opportunity to share their story as an artist as well as their journey with crypto and NFTs.\n2. The Featured Artist will showcase a helpful tip or skill in the form of a short tutorial. This may include walkthroughs and screen captures of their work. A few examples can be: music production tips, 3D design tips (using Blender or C4D) and video editing tips (using Final Cut Pro or Premiere).\n3. Competition Parameters will then be presented:\n- The theme for the campaign. This can be an audio/visual theme, a prompt, or a cultural moment.\n- The inclusion of the quick tip in the art creation. Participating artists have to incorporate the tip or skill shared by the featured artist.\n- To enter the competition, the final artwork has to be minted on\u00a0[Rarible.com](http://rarible.com/).\n\nWinning artists will be featured on our Social Media platforms and receive RARI prizes. Each campaign will have a $5,000 USD (RARI Equivalent)t award split between two winning artists. One chosen by the panel (collective and featured artist) and the other by community vote via our discord. A stipend of $500 (RARI Equivalent) will also be given to the featured artist as a token of gratitude for their time and effort. We chose RARI as prizes to build alignment with the artists and incentivize them to use the platform.\n\n**Video Series Co-Hosts:**\n\nMark (marksimbiotic#2828) and Nathalie (fractilians#3980)\n\n**Video Campaign Structure:**\n\nWe will be creating 2 Major Campaigns over the next 3.5 months.

This pays for the core team for a 3.5 month commitment and for 2 campaigns.\n\n**Itemized allocation as follows:**\n\n$5,500 (RARI equivalent) per campaign will go towards prizes and featured artist stipend:\n\n- $5,000 (RARI equivalent) for Community prize and Panel Prize, split 50/50.\n- $500 (RARI equivalent) for featured artists.\n\n$6,750 (RARI equivalent) monthly will go towards the core team and transaction costs:\n\n- Nathalie, Campaign Lead - $3,000 (RARI equivalent)\n- Mark, Project Manager & Artist Relations - $3,000 (RARI equivalent)\n- Jorge, Discord Moderator - $500 (RARI equivalent)\n- Transaction costs - $250 (RARI equivalent) . This covers transaction costs of sending funds to the core team and to featured artists and participants.\n\nThe scope of contribution and service represents 10-20 hours per week of work from each team member commensurate with current active campaigns and project volume. This includes content ideation and creation, artist relations, project management, community management and marketing. This is expected to increase over time. We would ask to revisit allocation when workload doubles. We will continue to provide value on behalf of the Rarible Community for the next 3.5 months and review at the end of that period.\n\nWe see ourselves as independent contractors and will report taxes to the proper tax institution in which we reside.\n\n### Proposed payment schedule\n1. First payment of $6,750 after the initial plan for the first campaign concept is created and shared.\n2. Second payment of $5,500 after the first campaign videos / content are created (in time to give out the funds).\n3. Second payment of $12,250 after the second campaign concept is created and shared.\n4. Final payment of $10,125 upon completion.", "choices": ["Vote FOR", "Vote AGAINST"], "start": 1622228400, "end": 1622660400, "snapshot": "12519041", "state": "closed", "author":
