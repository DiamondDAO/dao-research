We have suffered impermanent loss on our SushiSwap brand. ChefNomi took the devfund and stepped down from the project. SushiSwap was the most talked about projects of crypto. Luckily @SBF stepped in unexpectedly. His efforts have turned the tables completely around for SushiSwap. We migrated succesfully from Uniswap!\n\nProblem:        We need to leave old SushiSwap behind and celebrate our new SushiSwap platform. That includes to step away from the old logo, wich was disgraced by ChefNomi. \n\n\nProposal:        We will now have to rebrand SushiSwap and make this impermanent loss a gain for us all. The efforts of our front-end and back-end teams have thrived. We just need a new logo now and get rid of the old one, also to mark the start of a new era for SushiSwap.\n\nThat is why I propose:\n\n           ------ The SushiSwap Dragonroll Logo Contest ------\n\nInstructions\n- Be creative, think out of the (bento)box and create the best logo for our SushiSwap.\n- (To do for mods: Create a new channel in Omakase DAO for this contest.)\n- Only artist creations of the new logo can be submitted in this channel. Format:  tba.\n\nPrice !!!\n- The winner, who may from then onwards call oneself: \n**Master of Dragonrolls**, receives a grant total of 500 $SUSHI. The winning logo will become the new SushiSwap logo. \n- But there are more prices: 2nd place gets 200 $SUSHI. 3rd place  gets 50 $SUSHI. These logos will also be used somewhere on the platform.\n\nVoting\n- We will have a vote on the top 5 best logo submits.\n- The community chooses the top 5 by voting using the :sushi~1: emoji in the contest channel. After that an official SUSHIPOWAH vote will occur.\n\n\nMay the most creative chef win.\u5e78\u904b\u3092", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1599739200, "end": 1599998400, "snapshot": "10860000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7813F757C33CF46f914090D87Ac9E84be4b03a6F", "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth", "name": "Sushi"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYtWucEYummnbY27ZwHCoGm9RnNDjmPjUFqVtEyEaNwMK", "voter": "0xcAf2d3f6c4A375ccEC74eB7eD5c03f5B6cd8876E", "created": 1599988845, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaXED9dZcyoAoBcVbeoUWhY4yPQ2oZ7hvawXmywVniuhm", "voter": "0x8D66103db545770B95a4f331Ea7eFA7258E64479", "created": 1599923917, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRf9grXBBZipAyKC3xfaEsbvi6ffqcLDivy5tpzJigt9u", "voter": "0x07c423f0Ac87EaA76481dD86d446A2807CF27c82", "created": 1599920596, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeLSWWXemyrzj8XxH1fRCn5DYgovfz7afC47jhM7hiUuD", "voter": "0xD6691Fe90B06b63B31c4b1539532D5BbA76d4261", "created": 1599903828, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeBLQz9hEoq5CoimKAndunUAvoczU8QjJuTP8PCG9pre2", "voter": "0xC4117edBD4E020a4206eA6dFC8D4a47d729aEc66", "created": 1599877986, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSLc8Ukspm9f6yaWeYLTZzaCuyVEz7EzrkwWm6Q4XX4X4", "voter": "0xE7083ea81d723a15400fEaF8424317aBA068f7e2", "created": 1599865236, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP6ka97JYfL7BCG6Vbck2bB3WDwmUUHTSFDaHS7TD4HGa", "voter": "0x475F31cCC270F480B29D271dBAcA4461B8706fCC", "created": 1599865144, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTiHhuoH3n8Fb2phr142bpYGAYQaorjekiqPcoWkkBjJ5", "voter": "0x9eBAFf2192d2746FeC76561bdF72fd249d7a73ab", "created": 1599864546, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaW5MnBYaHDJRfHZhYLcWuYkca86mFZ69zcxKvUNx2rcL", "voter": "0x2Bd54BC94086999fC02918962ABdc5657A378Ba3", "created": 1599858866, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPo2M9scC9eMGX1c33YcJdn3HvxpVb7fchWL13KF4bhwb", "voter": "0xF69DFFa2394739868FD69c3815702ab6b5cE9c28", "created": 1599850198, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQmndoLo2Ss1XTThQ4nP54er78mHV4NYa9d9HeZejxftx", "voter": "0x52b9783f1F955Ac10d50c7D4AB62d7F2288D6446", "created": 1599850127, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYhAAxCKZgqekdZTAf48KYYzEPtQdnd2HSuk4hjt5sFyT", "voter": "0x95b8d868bdbBDBEEA27Bc1A86C54F2d0F3C1743E", "created": 1599846669, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ4UtAfAJwP8kK98xQWnfZkypfhE3TzRHAasvsA1S383i", "voter": "0x5802CaaF72342C41d4c022F8cc6a471c532f1da1", "created": 1599846513, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWZj5Y5jQufgkMKb2rh1D9AUR9nYmR39tuLVkGpeSGPKb", "voter": "0xFADC91fB7DfF2373bE7eA312D4e3c2b70d844562", "created": 1599845483, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUiNm3Twb8HMZdwKFBykrq3iBR2Y4hZybHcBKAQow6gTY", "voter": "0x66ecAfB890fB1958325138e8Ff2e85980448962d", "created": 1599842887, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVYJk7vxkHLGv4QzTZBDVt7u2nwwMMm4gBxhMm2e5Mzgc", "voter": "0x7F116D88104aF591fa5fAF37f3aa5499D67C512a", "created": 1599785731, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}]}
