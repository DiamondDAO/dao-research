{"id": "Qmc3BQR939HTQdungssb5HJj8tczqzX5rdnNkKLmnhqyFX", "title": "Community Proposal Incentivisation Plan *URGENT*", "body": "We desperately need a compensation plan for individuals who put their mind and effort toward making Sushiswap better. We are suffering from free riding problems. Members look to the multi-sig holders to take action and they look right back at us. This is a plan to capitalize on all the brilliant minds in our community and give us a competitive edge.\n\nI propose we set a tier system of proposal importance. Quality of life, Low, Medium, High, Very High. For now this can be done on the proposals themselves, the proposal should include the options \"Quality of life, Low, Medium, High, Very High\" in the vote section, plus the actual outcomes of the proposal to be voted upon. The tier system will work as follows, and successful proposals that are implemented by the team will receive the following awards from the dev fund.\n\n------------Priority List-----------------\nQuality of Life: 500 Sushi\n\nLow: 1,000 Sushi\n\nMedium: 2,500 Sushi\n\nHigh, 5,000 Sushi\n\nVery High 10,000 Sushi\n\nWe need to be willing to pay our contributors handsomely or we will fail. We need innovation. Innovation comes at a cost. Incentive systems work. I will demonstrate my view on how this should work in the voting section below. Please vote for the importance of this proposal AND wether it should be passed. I do not expect to receive compensation if this passes. We can always vote to change the incentive amount in the future. \n", "choices": ["Pass This Proposal", "Do Not Pass This Proposal", "Priority: Quality of Life", "Priority: Low", "Priority: Medium", "Priority: High", "Priority: Very High"], "start": 1599998400, "end": 1600171200, "snapshot": "10855287", "state": "closed", "author": "0xf6423ebAEf6996Aee56ecb1D49be02613aF8555E", "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth", "name": "Sushi"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTVw19FitVkEF2dRiCFXJzknFVXs688AWaEuwQPoKbsJR", "voter": "0xcA968044EffFf14Bee263CA6Af3b9823f1968f37", "created": 1600024315, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}]}
