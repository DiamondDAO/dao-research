Therefore, hiring a full-time top skilled DEV as the leader is so important to sushiswap.\n\nThe current proposals are all plans for full-time employment of maki, but I am here to remind everyone: to make room for the future of sushiswap.\n\nIf someone is more suitable to be the leader of sushiswap, are you willing to let him replace maki? I believe that if Maki is a really good person to sushiswap, he will certainly agree.\n\nSushiswap is no longer a small project. It carries a lot of liquidity and the interests of many token holders. The decision we make cannot be taken lightly and rashly. If it is just to make us happy, or to make someone happy, of course we can send out all the dev funds, but what about the future of sushiswap?\n\nTherefore, I propose:\n\n-A. Now carry out a quantitative assessment of the workload of all those who have made contributions in the community. Including chefnomi/maki/sbf and all developers, and operations staff.\n\n-B. Refer to the salary paid by YFI to employees. \nlinks here:\nhttps://gov.yearn.finance/t/nomination-for-roles-multisig-to-approve- execute/4549\nTo motivate all developers/operators, they must be encouraged!\n\n-C. After completing the quantitative evaluation of the workload, refer to the evaluation data and recommend the leaders of sushiswap for the long-term development of sushiswap.\n\n-D. Implement a tenure system for leaders (one year or other time).\n\nThe above is a preliminary proposal. This purpose is to make room for sushiswap's future. sushiwap needs to move forward instead of just sitting on the ground and sharing the spoils.", "choices": ["Only support proposal A", "Only support proposal B", "Only support proposal C", "Only support proposal D", "Support all proposals", "Disagree with all proposals"], "start": 1599912000, "end": 1600171200, "snapshot": "10845540", "state": "closed", "author": "0x32090756e61322BE936c7F903B40ceA24641Ed04", "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth", "name": "Sushi"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmeR6vFgCwCq31mh8oSaKSa1cQhVzQ9SN1hnswBwaFo82y", "voter": "0x4F50d47D20380172746527bbeAa274940C38EFAC", "created": 1600092373, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYZpv6ko8oaNHpMhsZSXqzxuXmYbT6EWzi7CAukfm2fSK", "voter": "0x1125917201ed36700F86c3CecEC8C5DAfAe280D1", "created": 1599993958, "choice": 5, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPr62YZLV7v9NgJJpa4Y6pu8qmevSkkSoS9sXvNL8Uizj", "voter": "0xCdD393DE5940989b4C6a8bEA4c4EE710a0fc5676", "created": 1599945494, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPuiot12WcnPY58vcnHaHPx1cNtanT4rG6JsAGqAxND3W", "voter": "0x9936bffD822149Cf9cf0722547FA720159Dc5fDa", "created": 1599928945, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmcb9EtgfTMYxJY8ACSaSPeQYLWxH4LNr5xaKoPeeP7xP3", "voter": "0x13443572F1e501D052260137Cf4562857A5A1d67", "created": 1599926688, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYTpkdFiZrfrFS3b14PJ2qVQqLpVKHxAr6cqWyLogj8Fo", "voter": "0xacc174FD4e52D3c6A562D20c02551DE88D430D49", "created": 1599923284, "choice": 5, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdDakSMJmGaK5G2rXgGRhU9iATLhgLbMoAuzutgeEQxkV", "voter": "0x07c423f0Ac87EaA76481dD86d446A2807CF27c82", "created": 1599920192, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}]}
