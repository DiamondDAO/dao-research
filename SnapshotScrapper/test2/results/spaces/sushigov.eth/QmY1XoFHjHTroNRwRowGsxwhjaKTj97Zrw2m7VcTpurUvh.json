{"id": "QmY1XoFHjHTroNRwRowGsxwhjaKTj97Zrw2m7VcTpurUvh", "title": "*UPDATED* Community Incentivization Plan", "body": "We desperately need a compensation plan for individuals who put their mind and effort toward making Sushiswap better. We are suffering from free riding problems. Members look to the multi-sig holders to take action and they look right back at us. This is a plan to capitalize on all the brilliant minds in our community and give us a competitive edge.\n\nI propose we set a tier system of proposal importance. Quality of life, Low, Medium, High, Very High. The tier system will work as follows, and successful proposals that are implemented by the team will receive the following awards from the dev fund after a secondary vote to decide their importance/compensation level. \n\n------------Priority List-----------------\nQuality of Life: 500 Sushi\n\nLow: 1,000 Sushi\n\nMedium: 2,500 Sushi\n\nHigh, 5,000 Sushi\n\nVery High 10,000 Sushi\n\nWe need to be willing to pay our contributors handsomely or we will fail. We need innovation. Innovation comes at a cost. Incentive systems work.  I do not expect to receive compensation if this passes. We can always vote to change the incentive amounts in the future.", "choices": ["YES", "NO"], "start": 1599998400, "end": 1600171200, "snapshot": "10855426", "state": "closed", "author": "0xf6423ebAEf6996Aee56ecb1D49be02613aF8555E", "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth", "name": "Sushi"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmeGvYiN7ppfZLJbNd5CMpQbb6gF7U8Vq8Fsmq93wg2rUA", "voter": "0x66d0E180af64fb368679F91765Affc99174396AC", "created": 1600105760, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf1rRAencxkuKpLcthcsvaw8L2C2xN9gWyLDtZXyhey53", "voter": "0x94612c0FcCaf013EF82C06DdbD6Bf0B993D7e016", "created": 1600084006, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcZdunZ2eEBEnKJ3WKyzqEgVTVdwKXY4DniFzg7G1BEka", "voter": "0x01f2f39f782228772e40446ef85f42cF775daa9b", "created": 1600069150, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUXFWeXp8ZB6TZMjVJN3bMhoWhEdkUWoSzaxES9KmZxHC", "voter": "0x4F03923B3f0B9D0AF057b297F6B1B170ded26319", "created": 1600042728, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcxJPjWAG1VZyrrvNg31erRV51zLmC6drNkEh4MnV5tYb", "voter": "0xD4C2e4Aa47Bd511D2658793DAd7FD682b6E0b6a4", "created": 1600030312, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQhZmgKQNfkBxQ617rjUMh1AyFqdgFeiGUoK7fggQrSad", "voter": "0x182A1093edbd452DF112F3ab9d5D02E4405946EA", "created": 1600025647, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}]}
