{"id": "QmcbcJPfdKUN6MMq6nUq5nReFgp1f8iXTVAZcHcekPY84v", "title": "Should we reward our volunteers?", "body": "These days are busy days for our newborn community; despite not having received a single $, lots of volunteers are working for our community, moderating our Discord and answering our questions.\n\nI think it would be fair enough to send them a small one-time reward for their time and patience.\n\nWith this poll I'm asking you, the community, if you think we should reward our mods for their efforts, and maybe ask them if they are interested in working full time at our Discord.\n\nAfter all, the only thing that makes us better than UniSwap at the moment is our community and the fact that we're truly decentralized (well, we still have whales but I guess that's part of the game) because all of us are part of something bigger.\n\nAnd guess what?Our Discord server is crucial for our community, for its development and for its well-being, and this is why I think it's REALLY important to keep it clean and functional.\n\nAlso, our community exists in the first place because our volunteers stepped up and decided to spend their time for our project.\n\nThis is why I think we should reward them.\nDon't ignore the silent but meaningful impact these guys have had on our community.\nDon't undervalue our Discord server, because it will be crucial for the well being of our community: polls shouldn't be started only by multisig owners or other \"sushi-influencer\".\n\nAlso, lots of things need to be done:\n- an antispam system should be implemented in our #general channel because of bots and scammers: these kind of people can ruin our ecosystem and surely it's not good for our image if we have a messy server with scammers spamming their links\n- someone should actually EXPLAIN polls to the community, because 75% of the people in our server don't even understand why they're voting and most of them aren't voting at all\n- we probably need someone to actually moderate our debates because I've read lots of interesting ideas but no one actually translated those ideas into a real poll, and lots of polls are simply IGNORED if they're not backed up by a moderator or a multisig; basically we need mods who understand a certain community sentiment and can translate that sentiment into a meaningful poll: look at what happened with the whole buyback story..the buyback won but we didn't have a QUORUM..we were voting without knowing how many votes would be enough to let the buyback pass\n- and many other things\n\nI think a small reward would be a fair and just incentive for these people to improve our community and keep doing the great job they're doing; right now our mods have to manually ban spammers from our servers, and yet I receive 3 or 5 spammy DMs per day.\n\nHence, I think we surely need someone working at our Discord server full-time, but that's another question: first let's decide if we should encourage moderators to work at our Discord server, and if yes, how much we should pay them (remember, this is a ONE-TIME PAYMENT...something like a \"thank you for your work until now,we love your job.Will you keep working for us in the near future?\")\n\n- If no wins: we don't pay anything\n- If yes wins: we pay them with weighted average", "choices": ["No, we shouldn't pay our volunteers", "Yes, we should pay them 10 $SUSHI each", "Yes, we should pay them 50 $SUSHI each", "Yes, we should pay them 100 $SUSHI each", "Yes, we should pay them 200 $SUSHI each", "Yes, we should pay them 400 $SUSHI each", "Yes, we should pay them 500 $SUSHI each"], "start": 1599998400, "end": 1600084800, "snapshot": "10848162", "state": "closed", "author": "0x038eE56230ECC8fa7B2D2867FFEB424470b1E214", "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth", "name": "Sushi"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmc3q3F1KLPX8xsRTTtwtDQitxBLTHa8SSuuksUTModaVz", "voter": "0xD6691Fe90B06b63B31c4b1539532D5BbA76d4261", "created": 1600079989, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYHpNh7wAUHLsTa3riBvWMkKR3KH1TQo3FgquyW5ArwHz", "voter": "0x7Aa96BB2eCAF897F4595C2630d1258b52AC8cfA4", "created": 1600035270, "choice": 7, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcoHY1UyNyoQaAGmDPduS2uYeNXycNnvpwn3HKkqJHdUP", "voter": "0x6ff0BE40314Fdf5E07BcBA38c69Be4955d5e6197", "created": 1600023096, "choice": 7, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSx7Bpeu4KiaUHwfB2cHK2EHWETYCsCw4sBHcsM8rHC1f", "voter": "0x669AfA676b680320f8806fe7C2C21184958B13c5", "created": 1600021911, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPSvKQytY4K44AL1X3zZaSXeTfctje2A1YMXN5M4vZye1", "voter": "0xD1A98115cb6ECA88AF2f6Af6C64148CA88B4C6dC", "created": 1600018711, "choice": 7, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbnoWzLmFFTznqgH6pn77BXDgvbht7ia1KGgGaoXhk87Z", "voter": "0x9ACfDcDB64D3F1765dEB193F99c5a3eBB2d60708", "created": 1600018248, "choice": 7, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVJdQHv287BRetiRvPfcXdRxW2iiqGV7RQJovmqMBkgnj", "voter": "0xC88c7806Ea31a88f31D094243b48670B58c2Cf42", "created": 1600017916, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNxx9V21BvAg7LnpbNQZ4dhB4MYX3sSQBec7i2Y5VsQat", "voter": "0xE5B2124767F10D21F643Db08E4eBf0f17250d582", "created": 1600014917, "choice": 7, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR1Ne7iqVKYUu5ciRgefK8cvk29zouE3m6rSxrX4n7cUC", "voter": "0xe9C700bC103205e483A93d50A663935C5A68b4ba", "created": 1600004188, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfXunx97iV7YtcvZ4Zbq6hdLMvZkHBZ3rJFfoGSrxWjBV", "voter": "0x929648fA0dFC3637d55226CE5e3F75cae1566fCE", "created": 1600004038, "choice": 7, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZsmhABYuD8dt6i81X8Ep6yz88iAYL9UMCZkcWZ2t5TeY", "voter": "0x87f1e13435B9Bcd1172D62b611CFC21264989Ff1", "created": 1600003666, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}]}
