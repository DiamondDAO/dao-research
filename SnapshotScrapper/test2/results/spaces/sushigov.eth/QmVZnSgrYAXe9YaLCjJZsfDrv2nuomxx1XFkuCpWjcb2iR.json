We\u2019ve designed the REB2 token to be a fair and transparent alternative, with unique features that mitigate most issues of the original project:\n\u00b7 Immutable smart contracts\n\u00b7 Publicly callable rebase mechanism\n\u00b7 Decentralized Oracle\n\u00b7 Fair distribution\n\u00b7 Rebases every 12 hours\n\nWe initially launched on Uniswap a month ago. In response to arbitrage attacks we were forced to fork REB and create REB2.\nREB2 adds protection mechanisms that make it safe to trade on liquidity pools like SushiSwap, Uniswap or Balancer while doing rebases. \n\nWe just (11.09.20) released REB2 and decided to launch it on SushiSwap.\nPAIR: https://sushiswap.vision/pair/0xc4dE5Cc1232f6493Cc7BF7bcb12F905eb9742Bd7\nCurrent Supply: ~ 2 Million REB2\nMCAP: ~ 470k\n\nWe also started our LP incentive program on SushiSwap today.\nMore infos can be found here https://medium.com/@rebased/new-liquidity-provider-incentive-program-launched-on-sushiswap-c9848af84d4e\n\nCurrent APR is above 2000%. We are taking a random snapshot every week and airdrop rewards to the wallets. \nSo if we get a place on the SushiSwap menu LP would be able to farm REB2 and Sushi at the same time ;)\n\nWe would really appreciate a spot on the notorious SushiSwap Menu. It would be a boost for our liquidity and give our community and the SushiSwap community the opportunity for another exciting yield farming journey :)\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to join our TG (https://t.me/rebasedTG) or PM me on Discord (Rebased.fi#2841)", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1599804000, "end": 1600149600, "snapshot": "10842758", "state": "closed", "author": "0xe640F69288680517CAaEbC7e1986b78a9B5f9422", "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth", "name": "Sushi"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmfWTNxVZtNpiWTZiyutCsoztCv2RXs5LuHPQrK2GJhEfu", "voter": "0x07c423f0Ac87EaA76481dD86d446A2807CF27c82", "created": 1599920231, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPckR4Qc81sncVLYBAfS4REZTL1hKRQipuMr2fykrzbvT", "voter": "0xEF89060245FA4b73500891A6FBb33fAc60D0458a", "created": 1599890982, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbnoYfihUuwK1YDRREiaaPfNfsWXxH8nBpV39SkpYgw8Z", "voter": "0xDb919F86903fea772f47C845194D335A087E0341", "created": 1599890962, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRqermfhBG1AkqDtjRjvgocHeMMLqaR9fjr8xzzxX5zyW", "voter": "0xf7063Eee866BE955A23F1451f76ccC941F1b3816", "created": 1599856301, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}]}
