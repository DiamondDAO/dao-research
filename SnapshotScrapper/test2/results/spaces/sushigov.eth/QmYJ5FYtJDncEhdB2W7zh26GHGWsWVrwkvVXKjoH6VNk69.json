Therefore we can create a sliding scale.\n\nI am proposing that:\n\nA) All votes are scheduled for no less than 3 days.\nB) Votes 'passing' are on a rated schedule of:\n\n--  A 1% quorum at a 75% majority vote,\n-- A 4% quorum at a 60% majority vote,\n-- Or, a 6% quorum at a simple 51% majority vote.\n\nThis means the more voters who show up, the easier it is to pass the vote, as we can be more confident that it represents a vast majority of the users.\n\nThis prevents manipulation from whales or colluding whales, as well as people trying to sneak through quick votes.\n\nBut, it also gives grounds for votes to pass if they have low voter turn out but are still very popular, as we should recognize it is hard to motivate users into governance.\n\n**Pros:**\n- Clear rules for when signers should sign or not sign from a vote.\n- Community now recognizes the vote thresholds needed and can hold signers accountable.\n- Prevents votes being pushed through by a single whale, or colluding whales.\n- Prevents votes being snuck through in quick turn around times.\n- Allows votes to pass based on a confidence curve, not penalizing something for a low voter turnout if it is representative of a majority interest.\n- Enforces the default state of proposals being rejected unless they are strongly desired by the community.\n\n**Cons:**\n- Leans towards denying votes on small issues that cannot get excitement for larger voter turnout (although attempts to address with thresholds)\n- Slightly harder to keep track of as % are different at different levels.", "choices": ["Yes, require signers use this model.", "No, require signers use a different model.", "No, have signers be subjective on if a vote passes."], "start": 1599566400, "end": 1599652800, "snapshot": "10824267", "state": "closed", "author": "0xE80B5097862cAB9d83846875752d7201fF42C7E9", "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth", "name": "Sushi"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSn7Zs1DWdVTF3tccPPPnUmUTFvpQ1WaQ9xf8E7A6r9C8", "voter": "0xCE1B3019a0252B97A1234ea759D10344a060c9AB", "created": 1599634087, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZNXcdndvaLCHB5K5uZ77oASBr8pbwVXf2DNiUPRBMVTT", "voter": "0x385BAe68690c1b86e2f1Ad75253d080C14fA6e16", "created": 1599624472, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV2daiCAUFPHWD1i7iUwCiQEDzxpSBMoGMvDmQbnLrAJT", "voter": "0xF69DFFa2394739868FD69c3815702ab6b5cE9c28", "created": 1599613588, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcNBYYnyWUsnbhEjQ2gZYBU5hW9JP9WxTVgyoZ5JKDFsN", "voter": "0xC4117edBD4E020a4206eA6dFC8D4a47d729aEc66", "created": 1599612972, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUJ39bR1TA7FnEanLjeVMCF65hVqa6pZxfqpbuHY3YhSH", "voter": "0x7Aa96BB2eCAF897F4595C2630d1258b52AC8cfA4", "created": 1599612494, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}]}
