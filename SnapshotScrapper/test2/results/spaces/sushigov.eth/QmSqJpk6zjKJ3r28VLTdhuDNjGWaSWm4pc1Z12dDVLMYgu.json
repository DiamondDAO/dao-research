My understanding is the current plan is to take the total USDT value at point of migration via a snapshot to work out the airdrop rewards. It would seem that anyone whom provided liquidity at the 11th hour are also eligible for the airdrop, i propose that only those who provided LP prior to the dump and held through the migration should be considered as ultimately they are the ones who were burned. I suggested a -2% of the value to try and account for IL however i have pulled that percentage out of the air, there may be a better way to accommodate for this. I appreciate this would make the airdrop rewards harder to calculate and ultimately delay the airdrop.", "choices": ["Consider this or an alternative", "Proceed as planned"], "start": 1599825600, "end": 1599868800, "snapshot": "10839558", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB5CE69909FB22BC37702f1504c1eF8e23084Da49", "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth", "name": "Sushi"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmaVbvFwSyveHLGFnW1gqYNJdwk4y6cCNHHrdDhVvRWraB", "voter": "0x6294937fb9dbD74e9E565dBf18dc9fd830902E31", "created": 1599866438, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbJX9sURnHHctgWUuj1wi6V8tVmEQN31LDC9UDoeo8LYK", "voter": "0xD6691Fe90B06b63B31c4b1539532D5BbA76d4261", "created": 1599866190, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUZshtBHBaC3aubgUiWbx9m3nsPj3LWAw6fzgTo1mbWXR", "voter": "0x52b9783f1F955Ac10d50c7D4AB62d7F2288D6446", "created": 1599852318, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXGjoTM8RgTuQJUeePofWDXQ2MFsYA1TfhPwGphqmzXWf", "voter": "0x523CDCEDF155dfd4835e4898d49e6237f86916a3", "created": 1599850841, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQDWqRGwC5wDyFZSDc2537idS7yFhJC9hkXdg8SAQEPXG", "voter": "0x385BAe68690c1b86e2f1Ad75253d080C14fA6e16", "created": 1599849976, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeJA1PXaWxuqaRGfYXuwRtHhXA2DzLyB5ZrSN74oefUvB", "voter": "0x23BCF6B5c991067846F8deF2b9aa8a0D07b1abef", "created": 1599848038, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbdLvijbxWbMMk9iK6B4wrT4c64SpNc47LgUdqb5ot5rW", "voter": "0xFADC91fB7DfF2373bE7eA312D4e3c2b70d844562", "created": 1599845908, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXYyaGNdq15PiebGP1vP6y5fSSh2UTMKFCgNGRDNpkius", "voter": "0xCdD393DE5940989b4C6a8bEA4c4EE710a0fc5676", "created": 1599844708, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPad4b3wW7cH6qT6r89PM9bQHRvb9AmbSx1LJgBvT5ko2", "voter": "0xd21B6b2Ae0254060044024dC7E6929E8E08f07B9", "created": 1599844641, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWuznZSB9H8zuVUe42Gbc9jUYufidLQYQf1senz2cdR4D", "voter": "0xA00aEf043f6Fcca4b329715E8b4dA4d9E61CCd38", "created": 1599844357, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTP735NdpoFnZiJuMbM1wqiGHzuW5jMLtuCV4ELt1u92g", "voter": "0x4Abe33463ceEDc128f50eC8D845De873b48a4b4a", "created": 1599843709, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}]}
