When Chef Nomi sold the developer funds to ETH, It was done in one abrupt and unscheduled transaction. The funds should have be returned in the exact manner.\n\nHowever, Scam Bankman-Fried and the rest of the current administration made a giant fiasco by making two proposals, and publicly announcing a TWAP transaction. This buyback plan was totally missing from the original proposal and the community did not have any say on this arrangement.\n\nDespite already buying at a major discount, Scam was only focused on buying back the Sushi tokens at the cheapest price possible, and showed no concern for those effected by Nomi's actions. This allowed what should of been a positive event be hijacked by predatory large volume players and resulted in nearly a 50% price drop.\n\nIn order to remain competitive with the newly launched Uniswap token. Drastic measures must be taken.\n\n1.) Burn the Sushi Treasury Tokens to reduce the overall supply. Sushi needs an attractive price to stay relevant in the market.\n\n2.) Fire 0xmaki for incompetence. The community does not need to pay 120k a year + bonuses for a failure. As the project lead, 0xMaki should have stepped in when Scam Bankman-Fried made multiple decisions without community input.", "choices": ["Vote Yay!", "Vote Nay"], "start": 1600237800, "end": 1600912800, "snapshot": "9242020", "state": "closed", "author": "0x81893b7A5661D4BBADB29c5900d26af6BFE81Aeb", "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth", "name": "Sushi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
