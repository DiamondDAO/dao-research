It will be good for PR and might help us figure out some things about governance. \n\n25k for Aragon proposals of any kind.\nAnd $25k for sushi specific proposals\n\nNote: We would have to buy some ANT tokens to participate in voting unless the Aragon team implemented SUSHI token for us. \n\nI'll make another proposal which is for us to run an experiment with an Aragon DAO as well but this one is to get us on the bleeding edge of decentralized governance immediately!\n\n-- \n\nANT holders will grant $50k to community proposals through the new Conviction Voting app.\n\nThe Aragon community knows well the challenges of on-chain governance. Plutocracy, vote-buying, Sybil attacks, last-minute vote changes, on-chain voter apathy, to name a few. But new tools are emerging to help overcome these challenges. Conviction voting is one such tool. We want the Aragon community to test, understand, validate, and refine the mechanism. \n\nThe recent governance explosion makes this pilot especially relevant to the DeFi landscape. Conviction Voting eliminates the governance bottleneck of large distributed communities. DeFi communities could manage on-chain revenues, mint tokens, or run grant programs themselves.\n\nThe Conviction Funding program culminated research and development from multiple teams, including Aragon One, 1Hive, BlockScience, and the Commons Stack. Extensive simulation and testing work has been done in collaboration between Aragon One and Block Science in preparation for the Conviction Funding program. \n\nThe Aragon Association will fund the Conviction Funding program. This program will be run on an Aragon DAO with a treasury of 9k ANT (currently valued at $60,390). Proposal submissions and voting will start on Thursday, August 27, and end on Thursday, October 8 (6 weeks).\nhttps://aragon.org/blog/introducing-the-conviction-funding-pilot", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1599874920, "end": 1600430400, "snapshot": "10850754", "state": "closed", "author": "0x069e85D4F1010DD961897dC8C095FBB5FF297434", "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth", "name": "Sushi"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQ4YZBNU2DkM9Upt7LQkdDurCnfbLDXDv9TSHQXtVLpfq", "voter": "0x55a77F8e6eF4376e2F15e678c8b2f8819E95f538", "created": 1600208870, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmShdvPfWbu3Szgw3uPw1KvGV2D7D1EK9AgZPJPSaRkheo", "voter": "0x94612c0FcCaf013EF82C06DdbD6Bf0B993D7e016", "created": 1600083882, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVggTQGzvHgRRQFP1MyyJd2jdhuNN4Kfsa3xe1knLU7Rv", "voter": "0x069e85D4F1010DD961897dC8C095FBB5FF297434", "created": 1600075975, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}]}
