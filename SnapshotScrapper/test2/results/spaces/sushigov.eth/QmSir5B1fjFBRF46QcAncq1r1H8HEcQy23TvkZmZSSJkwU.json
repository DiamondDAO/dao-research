{"id": "QmSir5B1fjFBRF46QcAncq1r1H8HEcQy23TvkZmZSSJkwU", "title": "Fixing $SUSHI inflation without damage to LP", "body": "We do need to rework inflation for $SUSHI.\n\nCurrent proposals in the community with block reward decrease of 90-98% strongly damages APY for LP. As a result, a significant part of liquidity providers most likely will leave and with lower liquidity, we can't compete with other AMMs. \n\nLowering inflation too early may lead to hazardous consequences for the ecosystem. Other proposals create imbalances between the interests of different groups of users of sushiswap and serve mostly whales with opportunistic aims. \n\nThree different groups of people use Sushiswap. Farmers, who provide liquidity. Holders of $SUSHI, who provide price and economics of $SUSHI. Casual traders, who seek high liquidity and pay fees. Without any of them, the ecosystem will die. Our proposal is intended to satisfy every party.\n\nWe propose to decrease block reward more slowly, however, to have less inflation on a distance:\n\nThe first month: 150 $SUSHI per block and $10mln buyback from funds received from @chefnomi to cover \"additional\" inflation.\nThe second month: 100 $SUSHI  per block and $4mln buyback.\nFor the next ten month: 80  $SUSHI per block.\nFinally: 50  $SUSHI  per block for a second year.\n\nWith this plan, we will have much less inflation after one year as with 100 $SUSHI per block, and drop will be less damaging and slower. The buyback will compensate for inflation influence on price.\nAny locking mechanism for newly minted tokens will lead to instant sells of unlocked part of the tokens.", "choices": ["Yes, I support this changes", "No, I strongly disagree"], "start": 1599933600, "end": 1600106400, "snapshot": "10845000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9cDEA12621A2ac04B80Cd60afBF7eFf364AFA305", "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth", "name": "Sushi"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVZ9aEt4vf33WUx77TpEKeYYB9gntzmZHoMhujg7mHZPB", "voter": "0xa37125ea3f7ebc450c103De30556554E9B3Ce34A", "created": 1600093982, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeLhPnd17AP5GxcWHNFvQDSVpYLvkG9oZf1j19PXHsKzC", "voter": "0x7924AfDeCF45D815fb609B7A2DA514327733e287", "created": 1600091547, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXM65dRjoAxy65S3wnFp9QoYCexvegVz81oEE1Dqee4qM", "voter": "0xCBb02Aa8507f53aC12A3A8767a2Ac4f3FA7c8229", "created": 1600064234, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVqZshc7t22mi4LkpakyK5vRJ2Q8H9uqfB7GDeBDoPujx", "voter": "0x1846837591FCDEfF4ec8e01Ef8bB76645672b153", "created": 1599997074, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma9SLpXErWirvN8oTLLNSCcspeyFhYmXFtARkdREJ2umR", "voter": "0x1125917201ed36700F86c3CecEC8C5DAfAe280D1", "created": 1599994212, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaEKqdiDEK7PkqicMtuibWejWpNTKt71rcA5cwrzTG18X", "voter": "0xcA82421b268F06F2cFa9333e723336949e7b8FB9", "created": 1599986108, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTZu4U6V1jFCySuTDcbNTW98QCDrEAFeByTbMp3n9rAYe", "voter": "0xf7B4fee3E47EE92F5Ca8830c0F5d7bdCcD0cFc72", "created": 1599985131, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWScZYQWKzNNyuTA9J4Db3U1PJDMdAtJDVhVrrBk4jqv6", "voter": "0xEf9BE1aCe449eb63622B5c2bD4Ee7AF3B09Dcc60", "created": 1599982811, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSE4Jzx5ck1M5r42gx2xmdMLjBN1VPk5vDrang9XGscem", "voter": "0x4E0E75808D68c0a198E504b46F87D6853BbbF0E6", "created": 1599953049, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPUoPKUBYqUT9SazG1x3h43Pgh1ian5hWbyJxM8HExLJg", "voter": "0x8823fB20f9ab02a62c6aaa1E7D3A0ECBd3eD4968", "created": 1599944059, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUwrpHmsmMZfVeNiYk3B4qcpUKS8pCDCvYESierShajrX", "voter": "0xaDFaD9DFc36a22B45E173162588e474e2E37F630", "created": 1599940174, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPHSX1HNtFaB2Vy2xdhjNMfLfSBppiD8gsF521EJGRNV6", "voter": "0x95b8d868bdbBDBEEA27Bc1A86C54F2d0F3C1743E", "created": 1599937728, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sushigov.eth"}}]}
