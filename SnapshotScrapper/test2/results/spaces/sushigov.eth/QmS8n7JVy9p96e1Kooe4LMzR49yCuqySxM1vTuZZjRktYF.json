Some also want to take down total emissions, others don\u2019t.  In addition there has been discussion of a hard cap on Sushi supply.\n\nThis poll is to establish two things:\n\nShould we move forward with that?\nIf so, which of two implementation paths should we follow?\n\nOne path is to fully implement this, and then release it; that will likely take a few weeks.\n\nAnother path is to first reduce emissions, and then implement the locked up parts and retroactively reward liquidity providers with the locked portion.\n\nTaking emissions down can be done by pointing them at a dead pool.  Vesting can be done by pointing them at a pool controlled by a contract which implements vesting.  Temporary measures could be done by reducing total emissions if desired with a dead pool, and then pointing vesting emissions at a pool controlled by the multisig which would later redistribute, locked, to stakers.  There are other ways to do these as well.\n\nSo here is a poll.\n\n\nNote: this will take a minimum of 300k total SUSHIPOWAH to pass\n\nOption 1: \u2154 of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, \u2153 unlocked; wait to change anything until fully ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever\n\nOption 2: \u2154 of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, \u2153 unlocked; immediately take emissions down by 66%, and then apply the locked portion (including retroactively) once the code is ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever\n\nOption 3: Take total emissions down by 50%; \u2154 of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, \u2153 unlocked; wait to change anything until fully ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever\n\nOption 4:Take total emissions down by 50%; \u2154 of SUSHI emissions are locked for 6 months, \u2153 unlocked; immediately take emissions down by 83%, and then apply the locked portion (including retroactively) once the code is ready; hard-cap supply at 250m ever\n\nOption 5: I do not like any of these options;
