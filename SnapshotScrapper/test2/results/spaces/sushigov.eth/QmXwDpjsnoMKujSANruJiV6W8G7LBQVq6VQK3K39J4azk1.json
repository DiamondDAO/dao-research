I think it made sense to have both join the team in a full time manner to consolidate our efforts and to ensure things keep moving.\n\nHere is a short bio/proposal of OmakaseBar :\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1EVnNW-GWIjKLS5scPzgo-XsuiPcq6q49/view\n\nHere is the bio of JiroOno :\n\nHello I\u2019m Jiro Ono, an anon developer that has contributed throughout the space\nunder various pseudo names. Anonymity is important to me, and I believe it\none of the important pillars in crypto which is why I choose to stay anon for the\ntime being.\n\nTLDR - I consider myself a full stack engineer, with a unique skillset\nin big data and machine learning. A wearer of many hats, and I have extensive\nexperience working with many different languages/technologies.Have been a\nfollower and contributor in crypto for a number of years, and a big believer in\ndecentralized/community owned projects.\n\nThough I am anon, I believe it is important to give the community my complete\nbackground (minus the specific details), and to stay as transparent I can. So\nhere\u2019s my story:\n\nStarted programming when I was 13, and currently have 15 years of experience\nunder my belt working in several industries and with various tech stacks.\n\nIn my early days, I started with scripting languages to develop bots that I\u2019m\nsure many of you saw being used on various social media sites to help with\nmany affiliate marketing campaigns I operated.\n\nStarted my first successful project when I was in my later teens, that involved\nworking with several freelancers to help build out the platform. This is where I\nfirst became accustomed to the open source, and freelancing community.\n\nI then went to school in the States, and completed my Masters in Computer Engineering\nwith a focus in big data and machine learning. During my time in uni, I worked for\na startup centered around machine learning and helped build out some of the key\ndata pipelines and ml interfaces.\n\nAfter uni, I got a job in cefi with a well known bank. I worked in the ML\ndepartment, and specifically worked on a crucial product that is still used today\nto determine the risk levels of potential customers. This is where I initially became\nfrustrated with the legacy banking system, and discovered crypto currencies.\n\nWhile working for this bank, a couple of other devs and I started a\ncrypto project right before the big boom of 2017. After starting this project,\nI decided to leave my job to focus full time on the endeavor. Though it was quite\nthe ride working in the space during the bull market, we didn\u2019t make it through the\ncrash and ended up dissolving the project due to lack of funds.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve worked on various part time projects within ML and the crypto\nspace. Where my focus/attention has primarily been in Ethereum, and web3 technologies.\nI\u2019ve bounced around quite a bit during this time frame, and up until sushi was\nprimarily building stuff for my own use.\n\nSo why am I here, and why do I want to become a core member of SushiSwap?\n\nFor one, the complete decentralization and community driven aspect is very\nenticing for me. I\u2019m a big believer in community owned projects, and the power\nof the community is quite special.\n\nThe resiliency of the community and the group of volunteers that devoted\na lot of their time during the pre/post migration phase. Truly a special moment\nto witness, and especially working with all of the others behind the scenes on\nthe successful migration.\n\nA kick ass project, something I\u2019m sure you all are aware of. But it\u2019s worth\nhighlighting, because the opportunity ahead of us is something we as a community\nshould truly be excited to be a part of.\n\nOverall, my aspirations for this project are quite high and I couldn\u2019t think of\na much better use of my time then to commit fully to the SushiSwap community.\nThe community aspect is quite valuable, and I as one of the lead devs want to\nmake sure that we get a system in place that streamlines the process for others\nto get involved and contribute in a decentralized/secure manner.\n\nI\u2019d like to have some feedback and thoughts on both and if community is willing to move forward.\n\nIn my opinion they are exceptional candidates and some might have asked why this wasn\u2019t posted before, I needed to have all of the elements presented here before moving forward while respecting a small cooldown period and no-pressure environment for both.\n\nNote : Same compensation for both official starting date would be 5 October.",
