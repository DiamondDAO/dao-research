{"id": "QmSsgCfXEcEG4Ua7A9Dg7sPnxZ8mVY9NLcZZdJ5u75mtRX", "title": "Increase Token Allocation of Second Round of Seed Sale", "body": "Since the creation of the presale pool on BSCStarter there has been a significant amount of interest in a second round of seed sale. Many potential investors have reached out via Telegram requesting to be whitelisted or simply included in the second round for an opportunity to invest and secure an allocation of tokens. All have cited the same issue being that presales are sold out within seconds due to increased demand and bots taking over.\n\nThis proposal is for the community to vote on whether to approve an increase in the amount of tokens allocated to the second round of seed sale which would allow for more investors to have the opportunity to secure an allocation of tokens prior to the presale on BSCStarter. \n\nThe initial token distribution had an allocation of 30,000 tokens for presale on Bounce.finance in 3 rounds of 10,000 per round. Round 1 ended with only 2,500 tokens sold to 19 investors, leaving 27,500 unsold tokens. The 2 subsequent rounds were postponed and eventually cancelled in favor of the presale being held on another platform which ended up being BSCStarter. \n\nThe BSCStarter presale has an allocation of 15,000 tokens. Adding the initial seed sale of 2,500 tokens only brings the total to 17,500 tokens. This leaves 12,500 unsold tokens out of the original presale allocation of 30,000. If we were to conduct a second round of seed sale for 2,500 tokens, this would leave still leave 10,000 unsold tokens. \n\nWe believe that it would still be fair, and in no way compromise the integrity of the project if we continued with the original plan to sell 30,000 tokens. Therefore we propose to increase the amount of tokens that will be allocated to the second round of seed sale from 2,500 to 10,000. This would bring the total amount of seed sale plus seed sale to 27,500 tokens.\n\nThe additional funds raised from this second seed sale, along with the remaining 2,500 tokens are to be used to provide liquidity and cover the costs associated with securing an IEO on a popular CEX or alternatively to provide more liquidity on a DEX. \n\nThose who agree with this proposal vote yes.\nThose who disagree with this proposal vote no.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1615611600, "end": 1615780740, "snapshot": "5632963", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4dbFF4018771552f3914f17CA822bb0F3B452e29", "space": {"id": "bnfyfinance.eth", "name": "BNFY Finance"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmaHjYaJUPaxVRHH2uiCrnsyhTNdHrGneSeLKzsy7xFhAg", "voter": "0xbb35198a42062E37092fc9682eECDdb8513982C5", "created": 1615662762, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bnfyfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWFWK3ketksFJiPYApoJ8GSCDv6GbMZbsxUmCuptvpj7w", "voter": "0x6f7dB473873934f890A8435eF88e262195Ef5a4f", "created": 1615653712, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bnfyfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYW3w76biyVmWEv8achYTJepG3YWrcqsU7pSDQFNGnqDg", "voter": "0x2E792Cb6be78d89dAFc3E87D15c7196c36B0bDAd", "created": 1615651911, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bnfyfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRQaff1MdD96gvYVtgufvXfHaCgUiik2456RESoXwNGEQ", "voter": "0x69f8D754C5f4F73aad00f3C22EaFB77Aa57Ff1BC", "created": 1615650019, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bnfyfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZnVxJakXnUeWCfWASg1ANEbnHAx3qvP8TNFmbuL8aiTG", "voter": "0x3D3609D5C52737B6c2fB84E9C206113C22ACe579", "created": 1615649618, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bnfyfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZKrHfQJtEKZYb2zzWj8VHgeeYiXuVnbFGyWaYYtrtdto", "voter": "0xD5B843C31FfcB4Bb75100C40D07733b7EAaCf891", "created": 1615649461, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bnfyfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQH7yVAdRaf9fyaZqGQ3YYWbkVZbmGuZicnopKxVBDm7b", "voter": "0x4Cd761f852Ce5f12Ad11cc5fbCB4be16157d124e", "created": 1615649253, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "bnfyfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWHadRSmdqGnyyUa7y4FvNsaNvXwuWf885Eov2uixWqJa", "voter": "0xbEA9D9d926f7D6c7f5Ce3b838cBb47c3c81bCAee", "created": 1615630394, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bnfyfinance.eth"}}]}
