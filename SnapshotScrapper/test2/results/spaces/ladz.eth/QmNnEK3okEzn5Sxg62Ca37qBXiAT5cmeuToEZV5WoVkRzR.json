This will add utility to the Guardian role which will incentivize members to acquire the tokens needed.  It will also encourage more engagement between members.  It will be a season-long league with the rewards each week and rewards for overall finishes.  There is one competition per week and the season is 17 weeks.  I would like to request 1600 $LADZ from the LADZ treasury to cover the rewards.\n\nDetails:\nHere is my proposed payout structure and fluctuates a bit depending on the participation:\n\nWeekly Rewards (for 20 or less participants)\n1st place - 10 LADZ\n2nd place - 6 LADZ\n3rd place - 4 LADZ\n\nWeekly Rewards (for 21-30 participants)\n1st place - 12 LADZ\n2nd place - 8 LADZ\n3rd place - 6 LADZ\n4th place - 6 LADZ\n\nWeekly Rewards (for over 30 participants)\n1st place - 12 LADZ\n2nd place - 8 LADZ\n3rd place - 6 LADZ\n4th place - 4 LADZ\n5th place - 3 LADZ\n\nFinal Standings Rewards (for any number of participants)\n1st place - 300 LADZ\n2nd place - 200 LADZ\n3rd place - 100 LADZ\n4th place - 75 LADZ\n5th place - 50 LADZ\n\nA channel will be set up in Discord where the league can be discussed and the standing will be updated weekly.  The rewards will be dispersed weekly in this channel.\n", "choices": ["approve", "reject"], "start": 1628956800, "end": 1629565200, "snapshot": "13024089", "state": "closed", "author": "0x89CeC4875097d7A06622D901f389236752c850B9", "space": {"id": "ladz.eth", "name": "LADZ DAO"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmX6SQgf1w5YcYNTKh2GEnGk1WyYg7NquhBb2BUSSEzv6P", "voter": "0x279A3fdbD6d6252Afc5C422439C7D7859a51a05E", "created": 1629327044, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma8fy4dwVcLm3igubCwK1J1x81SLfr4twYmMkvAjh7Ehh", "voter": "0xb0C4Cc1AA998DF91D2c27cE06641261707A8c9C3", "created": 1629215404, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYhnsoFXuWvGQ6D8QdFhK1P9oasECnz3yrzKzUZej45Uc", "voter": "0x42c22D603A5F90DB9afa24B96dd8c3CC758ac19a", "created": 1629194065, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaX5Q46FuW1zrQysJfvcYQoW1riAeUkiwnpXNqzS1raMN", "voter": "0x8c38C3435ce7C6831a57abcA73d895fe4Ec48059", "created": 1629149105, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmborHhaa7EnUCin2QHyXakCmPZsFcoBo2NFoXzo3bfsby", "voter": "0x9322C6CcbCE9fCC9BDC45fe2830704907330454D", "created": 1629072712, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmde4UJtqiyNSjyvZ3G6TpHy8KTczapyKYSenXLTbHHj68", "voter": "0x0B431F91c54C303AE29E4023A70da6caDEB0D387", "created": 1629056146, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPDBkJ9PBQWmxXdKm9jUwCnivwhB2xXRPTmcnCWGGUeDP", "voter": "0x3bBBcbc1c0b584F61ED746096E7b67c6BC2DAc93", "created": 1629055768, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTkgvRxPvxjnhX6Rx4kSPJiZj384wt1f11kajE5qKVSkp", "voter": "0x20Ee31efB8e96d346CeB065b993494D136368E96", "created": 1629035918, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYok2G9qgHh9XxrzBVK77nCEmLPDtTnejv4TyV6HBMMAM", "voter": "0x89CeC4875097d7A06622D901f389236752c850B9", "created": 1628961959, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}]}
