Bounties would be created and setup by the DAO, for a trial period of 3 months.  After those 3 months are up, the bounty system would be reviewed to determine if it was an effective use of DAO funds.\n\nBackground: \n\nWith the creation of LADZ DAO comes the continued challenge of how to let people know about the community, how to encourage connection to the community, and how to reward those who are excited to dig in and be a part of it.  While there are already grants given out to those who are already a part of the LADZ City community, this proposal will allow for a broader reach and a more outward facing opportunity for people to connect and be a part of LADZ City. \n\nCurrently the biggest way people hear about LADZ City is through the content itself, and while this is still the best way for people to hear about LADZ City and get connected, setting up bounties through Coinvise may allow a new avenue for people to hear about the community, as well as setup some unique opportunities for current LADZ City members to get involved.\n\nDetails:\n\nCoinvise has a very simple Bounty system that can be used to create incentivized tasks that anyone, even those not currently a part of LADZ City, can fulfill and claim.  Once an individual feels that they have fulfilled the bounty they can apply by submitting their proof of work, then the bounty can be accepted by the creator (one of the members of the bounty team), and the tokens will be paid out.\n\nDAO Guild members will work to come up with Bounty ideas, fund them out of the allocated funds, post them on Coinvise, and accept any appropriately filled bounties that come in. They will also prepare a present a brief report on the outcomes from the 3 month bounty system to be used in determining whether to continue with it in the future.\nAny unfulfilled bounty funds will be returned to the DAO treasury after the 3 month period is up.\n\nA channel will be setup in Discord where Bounty ideas can be curated from the LADZ City community, with Kcaryths gathering up ideas that receive support and taking on the role of posting them to Coinvise and making sure the bounties themselves get paid out.", "choices": ["APPROVE", "REJECT"], "start": 1628265600, "end": 1628438400, "snapshot": "12972495", "state": "closed", "author": "0x279A3fdbD6d6252Afc5C422439C7D7859a51a05E", "space": {"id": "ladz.eth", "name": "LADZ DAO"}, "votes": 18, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUSjRFuUvjC9e3vYYxdEpt3M3t6vqPbpHNEt9HxXdn6GE", "voter": "0xA2772d664574e5707d7DCf65BE988A39D63A8D7a", "created": 1628397311, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRzFmvrs5j3q7EDJVpUh5FfJq9hCg55jRmN3CmkehtJyw", "voter": "0xbbed5Dab841492Ce5F6c14770c2C8C565bEe3728", "created": 1628373942, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSJhHjhnHubmwEzeAbUgXEoBXLzjELrhxhPCEgMCbnYvw", "voter": "0xDdAaC482530e2d5C31C19727c6721e192d539666", "created": 1628370973, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaTAMcwVhMTwNaStiYtGD8gskMw5tTnHi6p7uh6t9zed9", "voter": "0xe729986A4B0aEc7F13321C9376f1b6c7ac4f8585", "created": 1628319726, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXsKd7kbbSVUJ18ZkpxJQLVH8sGJ4zTj5sj2pUPpisaS5", "voter": "0x9322C6CcbCE9fCC9BDC45fe2830704907330454D", "created": 1628318045, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaUf91WjJMuD1utDKb2deogVX3xGbCzWeavvx3v5po4yr", "voter": "0x73ac2956bBD5298C2EC88ee11F700F34B6f5ec44", "created": 1628303346, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQCCV5BfhvrjKHR5PtacDF1h329wxRMzyjhUUv24PcZQa", "voter": "0x9D7D086012f6c610EFA54de9A6e14Ca53629155F", "created": 1628294537, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbSak2UroiozU33D6GnB6Ypo3Wy4fUR8hX25Eu6TeX5C8", "voter": "0x8B8db5B327a3d051367D78b4a028722EE06555f1", "created": 1628290315, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNxqHcZXnhS1y9QLNDKg4fMC1HvQziaXd6CApdHKBKDNW", "voter": "0x056E0d3C18A19BFC3b89748Ef4ec9003F93dff1D", "created": 1628282475, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVbBSbGd9CNrm6LhfqQ8ShRC9quBuis56ELRt7B9jiYJQ", "voter": "0xdF3e18e87a9BBF4Ff39f0561c057f88F738BFe62", "created": 1628280121, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdcvCvAS7yDLeVeEymuJm5QxywHx1RnShMkaLLwD8kRRQ", "voter": "0x3bc9339E968f0931c5760E3cddcDbCf852cff726", "created": 1628276734, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcTW84QsTM3rv8n9ggVnCG3SfkUVL82AqWc7PC5NR9FSC", "voter": "0xBb60F9F245505F3d132974169BE1c01Aa68F66f7", "created": 1628276699, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYFyuWBUWJj3edkhemHbLqsmWBTRV8Tf5YYbcS2AzbaHa", "voter": "0xeFF83554219F5A774b54B1bf91b5e2cC905D15d6", "created": 1628274577, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdMZ88Ns7AZG1G1edAPNqEjgZngHt7mbh7LEEHL5uNYmw", "voter": "0xb0C4Cc1AA998DF91D2c27cE06641261707A8c9C3", "created": 1628269131, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPkmAHCWYtyzbGCvVjA2oJb6Jg5RwZqS4XdZZGT8oMzZB", "voter": "0x89CeC4875097d7A06622D901f389236752c850B9", "created": 1628268397, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeGn9vqt5VwwnLJJ9yMvZ72GsWR8kpT1vc7mKn8JVYK8M", "voter": "0x602D2a713ECe658a76989F4CED1bD6179544E7aA", "created": 1628268214, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSFBzhLtXsJgAEKhbkL32usLTn26K8pwG5KGNcSHDtRZt", "voter": "0x89A1145FCCAC1a2a9350eC1A4A486E4458D26274", "created": 1628268181, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV5Fxxieic5gYUH6DTaeujA6PGaWiimmfaojK8GBdAFo1", "voter": "0x279A3fdbD6d6252Afc5C422439C7D7859a51a05E", "created": 1628268176, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ladz.eth"}}]}
