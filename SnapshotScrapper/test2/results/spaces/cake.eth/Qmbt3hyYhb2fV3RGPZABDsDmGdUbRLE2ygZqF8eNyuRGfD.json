Among this movement, Binance listed their token in several pairs. As consequence from the launchpad offering and the listing, MBOX gained a 150% in less than 4 hours.\n\nPancakeSwap team are great friends with Binance, but there has never been such an event in their launchpad platform, yet.\n\n**The proposal:**\n\n**Allocate 800,000 CAKE tokens** *(~16 M $USD)* substracted from the weekly burn to be launched on Binance Launchpad.\n\nThis will allow all Binance's users to farm CAKE tokens with BNB, BUSD and CAKE. It can't be a better marketing campaign than appear in the first page of Binance, seen by millions of users, to increase the CAKE adoption and keep building its real value.\n\nGive yourself a while to think about it and take your own conclusions, then leave your vote here. Remember, this is a community proposal, it needs visibility (a lot of votes) to be seen by the chefs and so they can make it a reality.\n*#Cake4Ever*\n", "choices": ["\u2705 Allocate 800,000 CAKE", "\u274c Don't do anything"], "start": 1629658800, "end": 1630263600, "snapshot": "10275357", "state": "closed", "author": "0xdc89245Df6F7DdB58FCC8FD2069e1FBD17e90157", "space": {"id": "cake.eth", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSsVmkwx37JFc35XpZBSwB86VJgx2xPHL4d5M5366eQRg", "voter": "0xcC520a2370893c5Ab468B5C9E00189d411dE0Bad", "created": 1630262794, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZKox8tnjyLZd8LbzLYBpgfJgaUx5MQY2vfF8Ye83VG8c", "voter": "0x0A6b5C81aE07bB85E5532C4347f773F057BDc764", "created": 1630186452, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNQNToLw2gZ18aqdtEUY387kVJZ8Cf76igpBiEtEmWb8t", "voter": "0xA470Ad5af30BaDF2f6451AF071a0fc7A117cE608", "created": 1630078288, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP6pxdxmWs3Km2ezRkRJEQtTVN3vDB3goP64NevCVf3gu", "voter": "0xa84fc136eD5C7008af856C2B128Bcf1E0C869A92", "created": 1630063332, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbeZcEfC8Hk8PQjzWAQ9Atbj3VBJakb69QSVqeDXdDQtY", "voter": "0x6BB34668844ac60C91C637a749Ec41b378cf9913", "created": 1630011539, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWXdPfdbzDJvKnpXSSCih1bAkv9sCofu6ov5UBmvDXyZk", "voter": "0xcD69B13c6d482317Ad0Ba35CACb50B84b5f466a5", "created": 1629988439, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU8m9hNPkFoedWhLoeb9JqptrLZiUPr7C5gkjJurxWmAe", "voter": "0x90c26be8549923553a249Df086A2982FD27913bB", "created": 1629982207, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYQtGzo6qHc2Y3JvDNURWmcHzc6gFhdxnPqjfQUboMwec", "voter": "0x71BE8a000E25A095Cf8Acfa36437a3eE75020cE3", "created": 1629895425, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbLds3HyroEpZ5qmMSMwh9qNYsUgkipBqrDAxNnrcxy5W", "voter": "0x79376F6A08F4E0FD20f5c6E618CbC36f9e27653f", "created": 1629857016, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRzmd31svg8rugy7viCXbVRZ4RZx9CKn4FYhe8WSRqiLH", "voter": "0x9973e59FaF5A08d0f6112E46Cd4372dF660F7bC9", "created": 1629789908, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaHQjxCQuRn2XSuLKcQCfA3fXQbW4r5DFF88qKdXhtxQt", "voter": "0xC12D0F421C550b19E47573803ab4b688dc480566", "created": 1629709016, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPHHFzAd8Wa5ni3AFJeTaDg528XKzVSPHKGeuwtvzCeEC", "voter": "0xc1a03d3Ea213C37e5A86045fFE95096412534025", "created": 1629708997, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb5SN1QJEKE1UHy71dXLQ6M77SdBdebHxf5HvD5EHdxqN", "voter": "0xdc89245Df6F7DdB58FCC8FD2069e1FBD17e90157", "created": 1629708948, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}]}
