(13.3% of cake goes to each rank)\n- Cake only gets burned when it flows in to the lottery.\n-Cake stays in its rank till it's won, no redistribution if rank 5 or 6 did not got won.\n\n\nPoint 1 will have the result that if you buy 10 tickets and win in the first rank you will get around 80% of your cake back.\n\nPoint 2 and 3 will result in prizepools that are worth to be won and worth to take the risk to play the lottery. More people who want to play should result in more cake being burned.\n\nIn case i'm wrong and after 3 weeks or so you see a reduction in cake being burned you could raise the burn upon entry to 30 or 40% from the current 20.", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1628596800, "end": 1629806400, "snapshot": "9903704", "state": "closed", "author": "0xc9E9752525D47D25bd3A3A1ddA8942cDD3B45f07", "space": {"id": "cake.eth", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWTxQJbjycBCm2SkMjzdEvP7JPF3Ze5ZzsfKEJJLgFBVE", "voter": "0x5d7D0840a889776D3aF75a6A751f0b6E388Ba1b6", "created": 1629770901, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVS2y2jbbA785YZT2N6vUb4cXthnANdUJUcyc95QTfcAt", "voter": "0x90c816310Ed3350A7494d4E9C0CF02F96757EcAe", "created": 1629604828, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmdf6pMBnk1YzmtpHwvh2goA2yTTqrjWVrAZBPPpx1K5EN", "voter": "0x3F5e462A2CD8b15d6915f80201366E8DfD19004a", "created": 1629410144, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXrZ5yYd2CondX9b83qDvjpY7s5HBfXJihPPeWnaGobir", "voter": "0xeb7A650f24aBaEED2928b6369f9f158815f26553", "created": 1629177320, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYWu7yriTpRbFruGntuCiPDh2xXcDCjdGsine13fj3WBV", "voter": "0x59E468696f4816D6e1ED4a46325a91cf0976F870", "created": 1629123549, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS7xc2xBcVaiNkH6n2wBAgbg3onH64od5ovgdRcwqTJnF", "voter": "0x6a5a7020c1B0ddBC17e1c80C6435295B4d64f387", "created": 1628764338, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTM3Q6yrvk6jiEHRPQPxXAGYcEXCH5ahPgziftqE655Qg", "voter": "0x71BE8a000E25A095Cf8Acfa36437a3eE75020cE3", "created": 1628739122, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZKYreu9QacJmGbk7nQqSBGZiZCuX3dfxDmUBJZHshJ9s", "voter": "0xA5350B48Ca28637eB37785C138343F4B2072b2dC", "created": 1628602326, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}]}
