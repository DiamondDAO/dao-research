Some users will choose to stake (parts) their earnings in the lottery resulting in a bigger price pool. Even alone the cross linking and mentioning of the lottery on the staking page will lead to further exposure to the lottery.\n\nBurning and capping CAKE supply are tools which have to be carefully managed, and simply exposing a hard cap does not make a coin deflationary or solve devaluation. Pancake swaps work with unlimited supply due to their tokenomics, but to retain their value additional usage opportunity have to be found (e.g. NFTs).\n\nI am more than willing to help out either via consulting or programming related tasks if the pancake team approaches me as I see some value here and would like to see this feature implemented to move the ecosystem forward.\n\nPlease vote and make your voice heard. If you are against this proposal please comment and share your thoughts.\n", "choices": ["In favor ", "Not worth it"], "start": 1634767200, "end": 1637449200, "snapshot": "11939115", "state": "closed", "author": "0xf0bfb93B4389594cebec153153C84ec44bc7cE95", "space": {"id": "cake.eth", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x1cbc5267d24c27888a7acce681dd1e087e7c6b6484fe2a9367c77627329a52e4", "voter": "0x0Cc5E6eADcDB5e1959F32CDECc1B6345e36a42ad", "created": 1637420183, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "0xee9142be9aa08e346ae687907445048d8f970969eb4fd153e1bd133ee00a4fb5", "voter": "0xcaA6F0542A417b75Dd3eecb10CD43D29A0fF259f", "created": 1637336001, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "0xca9a5a2495fff912ab78b5af94a4226b82e74f473de6821e258da4b77e6ed975", "voter": "0x755Ae635904b36fBd8D61021f719cbFfa79c2fD7", "created": 1637335420, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0bd7b4bda326fbb839128f989c127ce0e1fbfc6dd0b81f22bae30dc5631858f8", "voter": "0x6f3bDF62be9806abFD327a9897b93AA395982008", "created": 1637333220, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "0x3f3befc070047a66e1b783f6a39f841d98b8e493b04f27d240e1b9b6079898f7", "voter": "0xF58540a25979BD1276072BC78Df43e24f5dcC600", "created": 1637331461, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "0xba4f2d1c90e3cdbaf818854aeb421038152b790114f70401ed704b1aa04c9601", "voter": "0x09e335aBE59f6d8cf41dCB5D88aB778a4a987A69", "created": 1637314917, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "0x109d8b4458d982c4756f8239db6958be00f2d5cc80d7d113d56c4e47096e0f21", "voter": "0x0916AF0651dc3108fb2F333E29caa442070DAb41", "created": 1637287854, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "0x527531a15d76720bb677f505953ee00b671f9968dbeecf499b77f9331da127e7", "voter": "0xd9293636EE3Aa663fc563ADB0912B0705dAfb62c", "created": 1636785207, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVNzxpPzrYzisH3XxBPtG7Hfp728SxYknVhcMg5wVp7L5", "voter": "0x464d0ad3d631ebfb99ca6f267d94A079CaA8862b", "created": 1636269369, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaRrvh7LKz7WzxoHPPUsfeCu9KhGiNpUMdN986qdVnRyp", "voter": "0x2d9c8F6E38A04d337d2d472Dc7e0981A70130C49", "created": 1636108879, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}]}
