(and I'm not one of these guys lol)\n\nHowever, it should be mentioned, that the necessity to open up trading NFTs with CAKE token, at least NFTs issued by PancakeSwap can be purchased directed by CAKE.\n\nLet us take a look at the market. First 15 minutes post Squard tickets sold out, CAKE/USDT dropped by 3.79% from 20.87 to 20.07, which is exactly equal to the drop of CAKE/BNB. People are selling CAKE for BNB, I guess.\n\nTo my own opinion, it's fine to trade with BNB, for pancakeswap itself is built on BSC, to some extent they are combined.\n\nBut it is not sustainable to create a selling pressure, pushing people sell their CAKE for BNB.\n\nI recommend to open the CAKE-NFT trading.\n\n", "choices": ["I Agree that CAKE should be an alternative to purchase NFT.", "I Don't Agree.", "I don't know I just wanna vote for fun."], "start": 1633539600, "end": 1634144400, "snapshot": "11561272", "state": "closed", "author": "0x775194f64Dc133aAB7767Df3147cBa93281534Ff", "space": {"id": "cake.eth", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTMjpyek5o2XqNakACBKfHxyguCdUjriAUVZSNuh1vwiP", "voter": "0xc24Fa73A44F5f462CB26B5B8fF49f2b698eE58bf", "created": 1634113769, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeaJXj2as3EEa1hRdqoQfs38xKhGTpeNuc3jgNWtkdf3g", "voter": "0xEdDE76cBC91080305261eb84F6b84ea1539f5131", "created": 1634087896, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYFt3xuzm4x2Ckt3kGSVZYpKtxxL7Jhvjzgo4yhW2kun7", "voter": "0x819Bc0ebdFC12E2Ac4A274DA9F4dE4f69E5ca745", "created": 1634057048, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaPo6oWqinpitspGLVP5K2rUzL4LePFTwoSfZWQKxMYMi", "voter": "0xD83e2cFCe2bd49fccB05E34B6e6a9512C87Bc82A", "created": 1633727505, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTRbep4zmTEwfkF5QyiQD1D88EXakuT5kprqLgN7A51F1", "voter": "0xB27b126F0c7828c0613a36a151A1931F80785a8B", "created": 1633634634, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcYza2X65teDhhiFUcxJSgRhsAUwhrXZTHKQu4mQdBs94", "voter": "0xb02Da4eeC854B8B551Dfc0762194615be3527E41", "created": 1633628210, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPGgp7PNHcYYa9yQXhNHAp89gPCiMSY6fFs5Zf1QyVqr6", "voter": "0x8Fd602A9e4Bb07De6A72b0fF020CeFcb13616933", "created": 1633608159, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbvAaPmQrjNTncC6m4yKsQgh2nYpTMaDVmzGH4ALdxkpL", "voter": "0x775194f64Dc133aAB7767Df3147cBa93281534Ff", "created": 1633598916, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}]}
