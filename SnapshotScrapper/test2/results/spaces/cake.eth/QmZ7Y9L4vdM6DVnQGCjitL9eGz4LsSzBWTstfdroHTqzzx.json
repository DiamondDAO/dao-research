This proposal seeks to create a level playing field.\n\nIn the past, new projects would typically start at very high interest and spend several days with interest rates in the 100s. In this scenario the 48 hour rule made sense.\n\nEverything has changed now. The last project was at 86% within 20 minutes of launch! Worse yet, I was unable to see the interest rate until AFTER I had staked my CAKE!\n\nAfter all the waiting, if I would have known, as nice as the project may be, I never would have staked my coins.\n\nWhen a new project is launched there always seems to be a stampede. People assume they can get better rates if they get in in early. This puts a load on the network and rewards those with a faster computer or better internet connection.\n\nFrom a project perspective, projects that still have high interest rates after 48 hours have a competitive edge.\n\nThis proposal seeks to level the playing field for all by removing the restriction when the interest rate reaches say 90%.  This would slso cut down on the stampede.", "choices": ["Yes, Level the playing field", "No, I like the thrill of competition."], "start": 1628564400, "end": 1631156400, "snapshot": "9907620", "state": "closed", "author": "0x80D2B45e1C2D4EFB8465CdD125e5Aa72D8b8928b", "space": {"id": "cake.eth", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmd3e9rKiffmnDu8brm2mW8vE1QPpscwGcDgrTSsaWAst4", "voter": "0xA470Ad5af30BaDF2f6451AF071a0fc7A117cE608", "created": 1630875162, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQfojKBEnnhMDSyTWxC8tMXjyjQEbohi6Re7f37KQ8Nbm", "voter": "0x03cd1ae7C97e790Ec8422A46AC34F7B3c9753C43", "created": 1630493702, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSmkEuLMbW7MTo5XDJ1zkZFhJJd1ziuwZEqMt92F11FCs", "voter": "0xD7A096d2067E395F14131d0F8B24E3a3CF2037a3", "created": 1629887359, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdDNTiTiLBgjiGXhL5MiwoTX3JRo3ezgA41Qvstxx2jWE", "voter": "0x9973e59FaF5A08d0f6112E46Cd4372dF660F7bC9", "created": 1629790608, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPQ1dFxQcpYCQooJMCg2gfCfwWnETripWZ4y2GvB79QAR", "voter": "0x3F5e462A2CD8b15d6915f80201366E8DfD19004a", "created": 1629409097, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmdn63vtDtMJTRhqpjbYasPvfof4HRULPtU1bz18eF5n2f", "voter": "0xeb7A650f24aBaEED2928b6369f9f158815f26553", "created": 1629175963, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUJsozewd7PvSVa9Ukj7bgfq8x1CGZBEk9frFP3YRMwpp", "voter": "0x71BE8a000E25A095Cf8Acfa36437a3eE75020cE3", "created": 1629043234, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQeesY8rLZBNPs91CvKYSvNpBWi7fKPRLB9tL7B5iUWMN", "voter": "0x80D2B45e1C2D4EFB8465CdD125e5Aa72D8b8928b", "created": 1628596775, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}]}
