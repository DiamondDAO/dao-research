We should use this opportunity to add utility to all previous NFTs issued by pancakeswap over the years leading up to the launch, to increase their value. However this will pose a challenge since this collection is so large, we can resolve this by creating an option to use the NFTs as tickets to a weekly cake lottery with a variable reward pool for a total of 10 winners; NFTs used as tickets will be burned to reduce supply; holders will have a chance to win cake. This is just one idea, we can also give special perks to holders of the older NFTs to reward earliest supporters of the project.", "choices": ["In favour", "Not in favour"], "start": 1632373200, "end": 1632978000, "snapshot": "11160602", "state": "closed", "author": "0x49CB69A47eBc5179076bdf1E33bC201407b6012b", "space": {"id": "cake.eth", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmV6ccqVoJyhaYQeQSTyU9RrNAyjdHySNvZroMDCxqxGjp", "voter": "0x0d3Fe5A9Ed4b9930EE477221C8d1871f03526813", "created": 1632963647, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma7MVmRFD5QSrxjqfLu8Q5xbSVSP2J7Tf9KD29VFu33Ni", "voter": "0x3F5e462A2CD8b15d6915f80201366E8DfD19004a", "created": 1632668498, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX8UJTYMY7odKJbAMVCbJ6zeUDhPQVyWmAXTzh5QPuqW9", "voter": "0xb7396d65aC352471dbbEffC94baf8eF3a7251A6B", "created": 1632497314, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdXoLY7tEC9tGcAB986LSKmjuwcQfRx1Naa2UwZ9yUE5j", "voter": "0x49CB69A47eBc5179076bdf1E33bC201407b6012b", "created": 1632463646, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}]}
