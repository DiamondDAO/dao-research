You will not be able to pick up/down and you will only know once it starts. (limits may need to be applied per account) \n\nAdvantages\n1. Burn more cake by allowing people to bet on a new option\n2. Gives a more balance win multiplier.\n3. Allow bigger bets,currently if you bet big your win will be much smaller due to unbalance betting. \n\n\n", "choices": ["Yes support", "No don't support "], "start": 1630191600, "end": 1632006000, "snapshot": "11034999", "state": "closed", "author": "0x42ba001719Ce41Fd28249073a7fb55630B5f9185", "space": {"id": "cake.eth", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
