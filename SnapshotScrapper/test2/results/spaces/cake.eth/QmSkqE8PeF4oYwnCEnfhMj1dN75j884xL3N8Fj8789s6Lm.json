There are predefined amounts that you can stake to acquire higher levels when participating in new token launches. The BSCPAD-BNB pool is a great place to keep your excess BSCPAD tokens that are momentarily not contributing to increasing your launchpad level.\n\nPlease consider increasing the multiplier either back to 1.0 or at least to 0.5 to help out users accumulating BSCPAD between their launchpad levels.\n\nThanks.", "choices": ["Increase BSCPAD-BNB LP multiplier from 0.1 to 1.0", "Increase BSCPAD-BNB LP multiplier from 0.1 to 0.5", "Do not change multiplier"], "start": 1629867600, "end": 1630472400, "snapshot": "10312685", "state": "closed", "author": "0x55BA9DA24e3575a607687259Adbf395ebd968a48", "space": {"id": "cake.eth", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUSuKM4cDmJpxPcjHPd6ehyukdnkCkD3LQ9VrrU419gKJ", "voter": "0x3F5e462A2CD8b15d6915f80201366E8DfD19004a", "created": 1630464178, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY3uKSAngoEn9etXYKKbSiEcWJdywPPN35wUdQgFNJfGG", "voter": "0x703e4b55AEC21f7C3B5AB986163f38005c52Efab", "created": 1630227572, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSSU8Hbn7UHpmsxJKxiGqetqMYATYtey8Bcaywmv3oVtT", "voter": "0x7FFCC57E0b2BFbe43d3d86A338c7957583ab17bc", "created": 1629996218, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmarPKACX3JiqURnCcgYmGrpzHzMCaWCH6a3AVZweHMZd8", "voter": "0xD7A096d2067E395F14131d0F8B24E3a3CF2037a3", "created": 1629887447, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPhFZXy1SCcRBcYaazhi1XbdewaAEM8LJyqwvanR8WGNQ", "voter": "0x33372336eD85F5901D1185AA981E58B2aa096F64", "created": 1629878785, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}]}
