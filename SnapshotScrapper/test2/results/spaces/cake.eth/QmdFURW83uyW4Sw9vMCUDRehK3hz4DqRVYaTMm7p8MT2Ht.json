{"id": "QmdFURW83uyW4Sw9vMCUDRehK3hz4DqRVYaTMm7p8MT2Ht", "title": "Rework Predictions (July 2021 Proposal 1)", "body": "I play predictions a lot. Currently at 832 rounds (58.21BNB entered). The new predictions update has cost me 3% of my wins down to 72% and I have completely stop playing.\n\nCurrently predictions are buggy as hell:\n1. Price can lock above the candle (https://imgur.com/gallery/IYpDwAP)\n2. Price lock ranges between 1 minute to 1:30 minutes randomly.\n3. Can sometimes set a position for 2 blocks instead of the following block.\n4. If you set a position too late, it'll just eat gas and say error.\n\nFundamentally predictions are designed for you to lose:\n1. If you win you gain only from the side you position, e.g. 10 players enter 1BNB up, 5 players enter 1BNB down, if you are on the side of up and win, you gain 0.1BNB (10%), if you are on the side of down and win, you gain 1BNB (100%).\n2. If however you lose on either up or down you lose your entire bet (100%).\n3. During a tie everyone loses 100% of their bets. Happens more often than you can imagine. Tie = lose for everyone.\n\nSome suggestions:\n1. Let the turn start and end with price lock exactly in 5 minutes together with the start of a new 5 minutes candlestick. That way we are predicting the next candle. No more price lock lag or price lock at impossible prices because it is the closing price of the candle. This will ensure fairness.\n2. Rework how losing and ties work because losing your entire bet is painful and users/players will leave pcs.\n3. Close the round early to avoid wasting gas.\n4. Open your mobile phone and go to predictions page, odds are the page is too long and can't adjust the height of the charts tab. I have to scroll in between the top and bottom while the nav hides and show a little of the timer and show half the bottom 3 tabs. Really unintuitive mobile responsiveness. Please auto resize height of the page to the height of the mobile screen (iOS).\n\nMore and more players are choosing to stop playing predictions (myself included), you can tell by the amount of BNB in the rounds. It used to be 30-60BNB per block, now it's down to 15-30BNB. Please rework predictions or continue to find ways to improve predictions. Guys please vote if you agree. Thank you PCS team for your dedication.\n\n\n", "choices": ["Rework prediction to make it more predictable", "Leave prediction as it is"], "start": 1627142400, "end": 1627833600, "snapshot": "9439022", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb7773b058a763f97E6327eB277788E557BEdE4A0", "space": {"id": "cake.eth", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXEyvMwRAzZFoJFoS1cFR8VW7noVjWXPDnMc3Gggj1Wu1", "voter": "0xA41e21E26b5bf296C7c84790B152C504F6cC372A", "created": 1627823589, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSiUUjqogJ8mPYAob9ASX1XhcUCBN9C9QvGjLFXv2kFXV", "voter": "0xF4c69123ff1C84f3ec2416164c1ADE375F059d6f", "created": 1627819624, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSJcmGuBTd8ccL1JymvkPC5H1Z9YDQh6kx94hKXQZQ4CR", "voter": "0xc52B36d77BDFD7B864c6Ca37FE01a75eC3108dC5", "created": 1627806870, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQMfCTv5TA1qgThbpUGoqxyxFZ9nt72xDZu7c799C7GRi", "voter": "0x772040010aB1525A9F785a6396F7C9a6EC5B3721", "created": 1627790778, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdpgEy9WDAgiJuYWh9zy9tfbbdjSWGHrYv9AeUnmEQwRG", "voter": "0xFF02004eb3C527634ada7B073Fa3A037DEAaF4Fc", "created": 1627599150, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdDbZiFgae8gzmL9oGwWmNG81a9dX99Nich6xe5V26ewW", "voter": "0x483F8c606F934fcAC72d618466516122b4E69A35", "created": 1627521226, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRiJAK28594MFkDdBPpAKy46xEGgP33vpU2P6ozikJzRd", "voter": "0xC016BE1c66f2151376d2A98463D5cB8E73cFc850", "created": 1627474864, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYfiKzevA7GmzdPv8UiSGLmgSTdUzNumzWhFL8XGV4CfE", "voter": "0x438487665DE4FFc95E9F2ce9Bd54DA8B9C63960e", "created": 1627460941, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUUwDrugn57vA8ECWAZjMpywxyD7QN8Pc6No58EEREck3", "voter": "0x6D215e699D889910714265743a791515E53f0f31", "created": 1627396679, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSyZd5aTJbSz4fwFFZCwwQtA4No2brQE2LzvERPtsAweB", "voter": "0x97D1Ca4D189DD8ccCaff05D7011beED4Fb926000", "created": 1627374700, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmcwvw36R5huJmV8x6oCTDG8yzpsncDh6Ebp9H9V8StvoJ", "voter": "0x1ede3901d82fA2A889fbFB1b4B976618fb504080", "created": 1627308557, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeSsgrMEUCZXh7C1xhkbPnV7pxWcTvC3P5DUxCoee9haD", "voter": "0xD7A096d2067E395F14131d0F8B24E3a3CF2037a3", "created": 1627296297, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbrrzip14gw1QzsqmTpMr9q4pkc5JnMFuqz2HDjvojeqt", "voter": "0x63C9E55583A2892bdc3B457a08C140FC74dcD34B", "created": 1627191663, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVPXpRCf339kbsju9rgUCF7XcCJPPCxc2L3TvwWWh6rVA", "voter": "0xb7773b058a763f97E6327eB277788E557BEdE4A0", "created": 1627185160, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSmZL8R9yjDGRqwoLfGDjeEW6xNSVXGKjQcLuzFeVPUkf", "voter": "0x7E82CD11BdbfAE5e21fb7fA8C6255885512D784C", "created": 1627183341, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme5u81z3zUzUgirHh5h4a4nj7sh9TmcssQE8EPsgkSBsD", "voter": "0xd5D736a91c46b6E0d363aF941e3989F35511D4fd", "created": 1627183335, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}]}
