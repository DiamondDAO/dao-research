So CAKE can become like a stable coin by purchasing 50%\nCAKE and Shorting 50% CAKE - and then auto rebalancing with an algorithm as required depending on if\nCAKE price goes up or down. Use this to pay high APR for staking stable coins.\n\nIn more detail:\n\n1 Allow users to stake stable coins - USDT, USDC, BUSD, etc.. on PCS.\n\n2 Write code to automatically market buy CAKE with staked stable coins.\n\n3 Write code to automatically stake half of the CAKE in the CAKE syrup pool.\n\n4 With the other half of the purchased CAKE write code to automatically short CAKE (work with Binance\nto set this up).\n\n5 Write code to keep the proper ratio of CAKE in the syrup pool vs. CAKE being shorted so that there is\nminimal gain or loss with the fluctuations of CAKE price. (Think this through, it is possible excluding the\ntransaction fees and short interest charged). Chefs are smart they can figure this out and write an\nalgorithim that works.\n\n6 You are going to have to pay fees and shorting interest - this will be paid from the CAKE profits from\nthe 50% CAKE staked.\n\nPresently CAKE pays 67% APR. Let's pretned 7% of that goes to transaction fees and shorting fees (it is\nlikely much less than that). So we are down to 60% APR.\nBut only half of the CAKE is being staked. So we cut the APR in half to 30%.\n\nWhen someone withdrawls their stable coin, the CAKE is removed from the Short postion and Syrup\npool in proper porportions and converted back to the stable coin and they get their stable coin with the\nstaking profits.\n\nStaking stables for 30% profit ? Fantastic, but let's not be that nice.\nTake half of the CAKE profits and burn them!!\n\nSo you get 15% APR profits for staking a stable coin. Still pretty awesome!\n\nHow beneficial is this really ?\n\n1) Hundreds of millions of dollars will be staked. How do I know ? Check the stable farms usdc-busd,\nusdc-usdt, etc.. They have hundreds of millions and the APR is around 8 to 10%. Therefore hundreds of\nmillions of dollars of CAKE will be market purchased and locked up and out of circulation. Supply and\nDemand!\n\n2) 50% of the CAKE purchased will never earn rewards and won't dilute the CAKE syrup pool. It will be\non Binance shorting CAKE.\n\n3) The other 50% will earn CAKE but half of it gets burned, helping turn CAKE deflationary.\n\n4) Many in crypto keep a portion of their crypto in stables, if they can earn 15% APR in stables on a\nreliable and trustworhty platform they will do it.\n\nThis is a game changer if it can be implemented, I hope you vote yes. As the person coming up with this idea, if it is accepted AND implemented by the Chefs I would ask the first 3000 CAKE burned by this mechanism be sent to the address of this proposal as a reward.", "choices": ["Yes, great idea and I support the reward!", "Yes, great idea but you don't deserve a reward.", "No, I have no clue of what all that means.", "No, I have no idea what you are talking about."], "start": 1628827200, "end": 1630382400, "snapshot": "9973765", "state": "closed", "author": "0xFC29Be05eeCfeed0A1BcAbC86Dc57139D33CC149", "space": {"id": "cake.eth", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZzfgNbbXa9Wb6EkVJo2DbCo5iFTXWZuJbW27XvLs3PKN", "voter": "0x9f3D0e826410d3fC0ADe0e97cEd8cD4B957D4889", "created": 1630182870, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcSKyEQtzBtFxuJYpoNRAWQ3Gxg9Kgbv5ZntvZfQuBVRn", "voter": "0x503E835F9D88a8ffC47A8655E91b3D67C0d5838A", "created": 1630028119, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNSusvXMon7CXCqq6XyJk1tPBpA7cvVHkYqMtm7su2gUe", "voter": "0x7FFCC57E0b2BFbe43d3d86A338c7957583ab17bc", "created": 1629889892, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR5tPW8dVEJp9Qayo5HuKd9LiQNwpoTAyupJXF4atAjQk", "voter": "0x75b3715D6dd38de0763C80D1E29087E1CE8B0F31", "created": 1629865622, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYFCidH2didoksWfu4t6VnHXv6ZtnzwuX9q7hn6r73ioj", "voter": "0x79376F6A08F4E0FD20f5c6E618CbC36f9e27653f", "created": 1629857300, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUdJj33JWqpcMWancFUnWv9Ez1Hib2KJsN2qJuBpuzg48", "voter": "0x0fB213a1Af101b1429e6aD3020ad92Fb0D25Eb1E", "created": 1629816766, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPQkUbZDV7jMmRqQu9Bs9MNSCRNi38mNt5Yos5XjQFEG4", "voter": "0x9973e59FaF5A08d0f6112E46Cd4372dF660F7bC9", "created": 1629790148, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXGFFaoL2pUfe6cxKbdyGjd89Roo9kE9hAPS6D16emQQq", "voter": "0xBCBef50b525FEb04738Ccef4eE539208d10A1Ee7", "created": 1629772044, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWKU2SP5Gi5s1ozeMxvMuuy4nqBLbjc1d2kumnTqAZK1e", "voter": "0xA5350B48Ca28637eB37785C138343F4B2072b2dC", "created": 1629765560, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmdo4WZP3155rJp6bWDjADtKqXqYABvUq8GqpoKBn3Ncnh", "voter": "0x8D17aA3C28BBe22bb290659Ff337808964bd26A4", "created": 1629645281, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR7kMUkhYqu7hE9N6BK5yTCSCcs3SmqKCoybUpKzD1koU", "voter": "0x3F5e462A2CD8b15d6915f80201366E8DfD19004a", "created": 1629409511, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNWDax5rGqoBViZo2sErMnz79iWSehDrdp2oxq1AVNp6S", "voter": "0x6a5a7020c1B0ddBC17e1c80C6435295B4d64f387", "created": 1629259847, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaygTwjeU3bdkQUTXPGUip82SpBhwneShagXZeyYZsPPK", "voter": "0xb527F2b86F027B1D51EEB234184198FF11A43A01", "created": 1629203525, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT3Go3NExFsADyUBC6dPq7A73xTxiRYQad84YcYKSKJFh", "voter": "0xeb7A650f24aBaEED2928b6369f9f158815f26553", "created": 1629176407, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWZT7qx64YyUHbAjLv6Ucswn9CizE4w9LNX3tiPDRHCjZ", "voter": "0xFC29Be05eeCfeed0A1BcAbC86Dc57139D33CC149", "created": 1628876768, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTLbVy7Uht9U6dFvhnh7Kp3fTsLk6Jt71c211bN5t4zLN", "voter": "0x71BE8a000E25A095Cf8Acfa36437a3eE75020cE3", "created": 1628872637, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}]}
