Which is the lack of emmission control mechanisim present in those tokens. \n\nTokens that have a maximum supply always perform better in price action because people will feel safe to hold them even during crash because they know that the emmissions is capped to a number by the maximum supply. \n\nWhile the Pancake team is trying it's best to make the CAKE token deflationary by burning them, there is still fear of how much CAKE are emitted each day. \n\nThis is why I am coming up with this simple proposal to give CAKE a maximum supply of 500,000,000 this is give the team enough buffer on how to regulate it's self with LP rewards distribution, staking and  community incentives. \n\nI stongly believe this will in no doubt drive the price of CAKE up because more people will be confident in holding the CAKE tokens at all times.
