So far we are entirly locked to BSC which has given PCS its dominant position as #1 Defi platform on this chain. No problems at all with this and im sure PCS users are happy with the platform\n\nI would like to propose that the planning start to allow for multiple chains(Solana, ETH2, Cardano etc) be supported on PCS which would open up an entirly new world of DEFI investing to PCS users. Why let these other platforms take users and their funds away from PCS when they can stay on the same familiar platform yet invest across chains\n\nWe got to #1 on BSC because the team behind this knows how to grow a platform. Lets spread our wings a little and dominate across multiple chains\n\nHow say you?!?", "choices": ["Yes Id like to see multi chain support on PCS", "No, i am happy with BSC only"], "start": 1631196000, "end": 1631800800, "snapshot": "10779747", "state": "closed", "author": "0x43E4BFb91d2cF69431562B152CE300bE8bdd4A4E", "space": {"id": "cake.eth", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmauCssjoEw9mQuJBm2VyCF8rUQK1hX5rQUcmoD4FwM4H4", "voter": "0x110306394a8150A2a4AC17E01Ef4CFB69BED04F7", "created": 1631392357, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeaPpp4fqwPQECFZx1svoyRvQScQARtKzDYjDkRhgyKqc", "voter": "0x88f484B2CD9Db48aDb40CC802d28A036F417c8BC", "created": 1631333136, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmahkWdfKJmbiRs6bhuqhVum3XLzZKhS2XfD2Y9PMMor7r", "voter": "0x43E4BFb91d2cF69431562B152CE300bE8bdd4A4E", "created": 1631332522, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYdTXWoN1B5vnWvVAZDsF6P8gsiaKq4t4KdPT8iLHRmZA", "voter": "0x3F5e462A2CD8b15d6915f80201366E8DfD19004a", "created": 1631326194, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}]}
