(The first time you Stake CAKE in the Pool) The fee and Unstaking period would also apply if you have removed all your CAKE from the Auto Cake Pool.\n\nIn other words, as long as you left some  CAKE in the Pool, you would be free to Unstake without any restrictions.", "choices": ["Yes, FREE MY CAKE", "No, I would rather pay Bail."], "start": 1628218800, "end": 1630465200, "snapshot": "9789337", "state": "closed", "author": "0x80D2B45e1C2D4EFB8465CdD125e5Aa72D8b8928b", "space": {"id": "cake.eth", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmbVFkfqZshoaWYLRL5r6k7cNFqcvR9kQvqDBmZdVLrkdA", "voter": "0x5eb484620DCd552D5507727d086E8AAa9D2bBAcB", "created": 1630422649, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXTiDWtzJePnBYzKHFt7RCGFP4k6cdbNgXHxaof7iZfZV", "voter": "0xA946074Aa48ad134095378e85222951C622306A4", "created": 1630108352, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTgsmbzcrPZdGYXxBNY7ke3Ty1o4kYBW2H5uopbt59hdA", "voter": "0xA470Ad5af30BaDF2f6451AF071a0fc7A117cE608", "created": 1630079523, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfSgheC5mz2NqRxamy3zMeE4bNjtzXymN5SV4uUus89WR", "voter": "0x79376F6A08F4E0FD20f5c6E618CbC36f9e27653f", "created": 1629857404, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb1Ugj8EGZ2NEUqafV8fxwH5EGuLRYoqof6CCyobSnZSm", "voter": "0x9973e59FaF5A08d0f6112E46Cd4372dF660F7bC9", "created": 1629790278, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSW8TWtFp9U1iuKNkAKrhVY62963Gv3GZTieNwYirjBWQ", "voter": "0x3F5e462A2CD8b15d6915f80201366E8DfD19004a", "created": 1629409253, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYRgE88oxjefGtratCsjDgPUfUXEG4Z2ghLrZGU72BFGJ", "voter": "0x94fdEe84c047D58FD7a0AB97CeF84A3c2E4dcB77", "created": 1629293358, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPrzpZ2WrDjB5yZXcPmBauqT5e2EfmHxB9sTMdZTkuMZB", "voter": "0xeb7A650f24aBaEED2928b6369f9f158815f26553", "created": 1629176155, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXZLgPRpFFFh1eTuNBEavtns8J9MvnXJunWwWG3XHC1jm", "voter": "0xB7Dc2CDf1E9eec08e8D03914F3F6e4a7653db928", "created": 1628596183, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXSv2mffTreq9JztyYuThsBrdUZhr6roouJJHTkSBw2tU", "voter": "0x71BE8a000E25A095Cf8Acfa36437a3eE75020cE3", "created": 1628361443, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmajmxUVF7ChVMa2n98KPoa3HdBEFhNZdJzgA9qAP2fKyG", "voter": "0x80D2B45e1C2D4EFB8465CdD125e5Aa72D8b8928b", "created": 1628231146, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}]}
