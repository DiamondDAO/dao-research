A 4 digit system with numbers 0-7 would have much better odds therefore enticing the community to play more. \n\nThe existing match # prize system could remain with no first number match being a loser. \n\nAdditionally, the ticket price should be lowered to allow for more entries. The concept of a lottery does not have to be nearly impossible to win a jackpot, the prizes should be redistributed more evenly while also increasing the burn of cake from increased entries.", "choices": ["Yes, I support a 4 digit system (0-7) with lower ticket cost.", "No, I want lottery to remain the same."], "start": 1626886800, "end": 1627275600, "snapshot": "9342835", "state": "closed", "author": "0x66EfCEb57BC21a7DbDD66BAeB5b9B7cA83Bf5d29", "space": {"id": "cake.eth", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQT4Mu4wupYCH9qP11PpQV8WBUbHD6SNLnFQWV7zwCE41", "voter": "0x8ecEdcE61BF94Cb0c482458cd26A5091Dab47499", "created": 1627240502, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcUCaXDVDKeoSirF4Xmax5Xra1YWDdFFgmkfTLeR1FgVW", "voter": "0x8562BCCB1317adA0d451B8f4504a6E4CBD4DcE47", "created": 1627228173, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYcJR1udLdLMr4RsGvm9dPXpJjzh2pdZPSQ7RwUXURuYe", "voter": "0x63C9E55583A2892bdc3B457a08C140FC74dcD34B", "created": 1627190643, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaTbUTojqRhxTY6AV3D5yYYqcwFkKrop5rgdsCJNzn3Kt", "voter": "0x9F9fB90476BA70C13E99E43560e48Bf86Ef40207", "created": 1627028861, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdWihDgs9Mu3S4sKjcvH9VyNFPG4pBej7Ks2CTd1mzimB", "voter": "0xb4c37C7AD3b83B66C4848D24F19A48aaffF00D56", "created": 1627011549, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZEokTxk1mXH5xTprQkGP1QZc3uLXnRnEraomEZ9a2cen", "voter": "0xB943EFEd599c3158CB2B8255Bc04fD1ACf6916B0", "created": 1626921722, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZmL4t56F4eexCXKM4s4WtgwjvkWyEGuK4iCqgDWwaij8", "voter": "0xd5D736a91c46b6E0d363aF941e3989F35511D4fd", "created": 1626906258, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQt1u2C5Hk6SgCffMPMX5ajhfbfLbaHRQE1yDrHwgTHgd", "voter": "0x3F5e462A2CD8b15d6915f80201366E8DfD19004a", "created": 1626900233, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP7sNsx1VUGePZPhntcJZuajvR6LKqs5TNLE2KjGp3VGP", "voter": "0xB34F13289FdaF5BB31d0A737f29dFaFec6852815", "created": 1626898826, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}]}
