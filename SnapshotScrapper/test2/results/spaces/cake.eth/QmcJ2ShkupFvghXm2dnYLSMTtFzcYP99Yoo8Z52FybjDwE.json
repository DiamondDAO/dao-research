Same as other competitor platforms, it would be amazing to have marketplace to trade NFT's between community members.\n\nThe trading system could work as an action house to bid $CAKE against prespecified offers or could work like the Steam Marketplace where items are put for sale into a spot market. Also, there may exist tradeable and non-tradable PB collectibles that were created more like an achievement rather than a collectible, thus making some NFT's unique and not available through trade. Either way of interaction, the end point is to be able to acquire PB collectibles for our community profiles \ud83d\ude42. Also, a leader board may exist to shine our PB collectibles in the most honorable way \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udf82\ud83d\udc8e.\n\nThis, off course, will add value to our beloved community and a different path for interaction in order to attract new users \ud83d\ude09.\n", "choices": ["I'm interested in a marketplace for PB collectibles NFT trading", "Yes", "No"], "start": 1629090000, "end": 1630472400, "snapshot": "10091329", "state": "closed", "author": "0xf76dB5Dc2fB94788C9B66c022eA17C51dCA51BC5", "space": {"id": "cake.eth", "name": "PancakeSwap"}, "votes": 14, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmStQ5p7qhmFmtWo4Qo3vGBWU7rtZF4JZmzEL6RB9nNqMf", "voter": "0x4C93204b3a394D298b1CE6d56fc6444177F8E8a4", "created": 1630466098, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUzNPNGCsxWTfKdF43VCKbrSS4vWRmfz1d4DgafV78psi", "voter": "0x71BE8a000E25A095Cf8Acfa36437a3eE75020cE3", "created": 1630138546, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXGnv4HAVAR5513ft7Wr4n8LSJ5FLqm3s1wbcEkDSpzCD", "voter": "0xa84fc136eD5C7008af856C2B128Bcf1E0C869A92", "created": 1630063186, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdYaqy3NEEWktemjbUgR4ejwTfuaFWjGHqfdD3py81J12", "voter": "0x79376F6A08F4E0FD20f5c6E618CbC36f9e27653f", "created": 1629857510, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSDfEAHMPvpkx5q3Ct9Qqu43ihcscfiFjDVxKv9tQpRRM", "voter": "0x9973e59FaF5A08d0f6112E46Cd4372dF660F7bC9", "created": 1629790412, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbH2yz5Kg54mv7rQyG7YfLAXa19t9iiRmojbeBbNuWCMC", "voter": "0x5d7D0840a889776D3aF75a6A751f0b6E388Ba1b6", "created": 1629772947, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPfcvHHSsa4XGbdLrP3zWuGabxiFq3Hk34NRNpqhygtua", "voter": "0xC2648eD4AD4a4abBc0929819F36CD4b35219f0e7", "created": 1629703601, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUFRkCm2zddCWuYHkaCjYHetYe1agPQLjtZTGvDeKfiA7", "voter": "0xf05E5668e8F46E242c51501d32607BE7d5d7a45c", "created": 1629622232, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVYz4jxr34ys661D7ZaVHJddKtpHFvtq9jQUMm6gLoQhd", "voter": "0xb200a538b2F621e423410b9920ea1c990111d50c", "created": 1629611892, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmctMkJpxnhqNkCVFELYnLdvkXbepMTXK431zAtJowHfcn", "voter": "0x3F5e462A2CD8b15d6915f80201366E8DfD19004a", "created": 1629409155, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmekQdrGUfnzk6TNMxdTVk9JDavAAktwHKHBpJJKPPz7vW", "voter": "0x6a5a7020c1B0ddBC17e1c80C6435295B4d64f387", "created": 1629260029, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP4g3LeYhJE6DB9p2UAQcnVmSpoyVs9HfN8j7Pmdx2NS3", "voter": "0xa891fDE42e982148b5F2f6B06F04be8e706a190E", "created": 1629189174, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTGJDqV2HaLzYFxVYGyhNAxaKMptkGmwK19j1SaifGdUK", "voter": "0xeb7A650f24aBaEED2928b6369f9f158815f26553", "created": 1629176015, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbwbqPzPtm6kAgvKUtfR4b8z7hT55sWJhJQ1iT7En9wVV", "voter": "0xf76dB5Dc2fB94788C9B66c022eA17C51dCA51BC5", "created": 1629166998, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cake.eth"}}]}
