If you want to breed Axies, the SLP token is required and the best way to get is to complete the daily tasks.\n\nSo let's think about the situation in Evolution Land. Resources tokens are definitely the POG token in the Evolution Land economic system. We believe it will be better if the further game behaviors should consume players' resources tokens like upgrading props, yield farming. But they are not inelastic demand so it reduces the power of POG token - resources.\n\nWe provide three ways to breed apostles. You can choose your most hoped way.\n\n1. Keep the status quo. It will help players to breed at every stage in an easy way.\n2. Apostles breed must use resources token to enhance resources level. It will help the value growth of resources. But bring some obstacles at an early stage to breed apostles.\n3. Apostles breed must use resources token after resources token liquidity pool created. It won't hinder the early-stage players to breed. And also, liquidity pool created means players could buy resources token from the market.", "choices": ["Keep the status quo", "Must use resources", "Must use after liquidity created"], "start": 1628136000, "end": 1629345600, "snapshot": "12943607", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa1511E5C683A007056CAa1d9A8D6A37464826280", "space": {"id": "evoland.eth", "name": "Evolution Land"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRuZfNTqNkLF85UUZxSyBbpVL86UpmGiY1aH7tGqNzz42", "voter": "0x80Fe65E243F0133b22d22535FABE4502bDA2B585", "created": 1628264081, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "evoland.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYT8hEJsEVmcQ5SLb5d7cHn1Xy3ZkY5pYYSqan2ygpCdQ", "voter": "0x5fF4a620FE2E7aB1A947B7B1Be5b1719D3C7F4Ca", "created": 1628142816, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "evoland.eth"}}, {"id": "QmduoxsK46rBc5u59dEiKx3yQFzkeQ9SBXB4ecRxV7RjnL", "voter": "0xe32c5673b152571E57976bF3A75068917DA2Da9C", "created": 1628140899, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "evoland.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYE4Q1vJ38BMG8EUT9bZgwt2eNMK3KLHDVPVBDVqHxZA4", "voter": "0xa1511E5C683A007056CAa1d9A8D6A37464826280", "created": 1628140630, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "evoland.eth"}}]}
