Harvest integrates with, and is built on top of ecosystem infrastructure that have come before us. There's value in supporting this so that projects that have positive ecosystem impact can continue to strive. A lot of the work that is somewhat crucial to the Ethereum ecosystem is not actually that well-paid.\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 This snapshot poll will help to allocate the grants. To even the playing field, gitcoin links have been removed, since about 40% of the nominees do not have gitcoin pages. For each grant that passes the voting threshold, our mods will contact the recipient and ask how they'd like to receive it, whether directly, or through gitcoin. \n\n\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Like usual, the snapshot vote is binding. Each recipient with more than 1% of the farm supply voted will receive a grant. Based on prior votes, that will make sure between 7-15 projects are funded. Since there are so many recipients, we will fully utilize the discord emoji poll as well. If the sentiment is evenly split, or really spread out, the discord poll will provide more detailed sentiment for grant-giving and help to split ties.\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 One note: if your project is not on the list, that means there wasn't a governance nomination with a member to second that nomination for you. That's okay. If this grant process is smooth, we will do more in the future, and you will have a chance at that time. Likewise, not all the nominees could get a grant, and there's no way to know how the vote will go, and the vote is not in any way a reflection of your impact in the ecosystem. FARM holders will vote based on their individual preferences, so for the nominees, we appreciate your understanding in advance.\n\n\u2728 To summarize: \nMore than 1% of supply voted, get grant\nMore votes, higher grant\nLess votes, lower grant\nSnapshot: binding\nDiscord: get sentiment, split ties\n\nVotes are live. Polls are open until 3am UTC - 24 hours from now.", "choices": ["1\ufe0f\u20e3 Snapshot", "2\ufe0f\u20e3 EIP-1559 Fund", "3\ufe0f\u20e3 Open source support fund", "4\ufe0f\u20e3 Bankless", "5\ufe0f\u20e3 Liquidity. vision", "6\ufe0f\u20e3 DeFi Safety", "7\ufe0f\u20e3 Week in Ethereum news", "8\ufe0f\u20e3 Giveth 2.0", "9\ufe0f\u20e3 Cryptoouf ", "A - Gabriel Haines", "B - TokenBrice BanklessFR ", "C - ETH Gas Station ", "D - Hackingmoneyph ", "E - DeFi Library ", "F - The Defiant", "G - DeFi Dad", "H - CryptoScamDB", "I - Rotki App", "J - APWine. fi", "K - DefiPulse", "L - Furucombo", "M - Furucombo", "N - Gitcoin", "O - Hashing it out", "P - Yieldfarming. info", "Q - turbo-geth", "R - antiprosynthesis", "S - Gitcoin public goods funding mechanisms"], "start": 1602990000, "end": 1603076400, "snapshot": "11077794", "state": "closed", "author": "0x252E7E8B9863f81798B1fEF8CfD9741A46De653C", "space": {"id": "harvestfi.eth", "name": "Harvest Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
