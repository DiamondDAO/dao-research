The protocol uses Uniswap for FARM buybacks because the slippage is much less. \ud83c\udf4f farmers believe that it's in the protocol's interest to move the emissions to incentivize AUM, and generate more profit sharing for FARM.\n\nOption \ud83c\udf4a: We want to diversify our sources of liquidity, and balancer is the second largest exchange, which allows for flexible splits. Not all farmers can take IL on a 50/50 pool, and some people prefer the 80/20 because it is less risk. \ud83c\udf4a farmers believe that it's in the protocol's interest to keep it, as a way to distribute FARM to this type of liquidity provider. These LPs also get BAL rewards.\n\nVote \ud83c\udf4f to move emissions to front page deposits.
