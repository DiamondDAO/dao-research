The price of FARM has a lot of impact on how much emissions are required for Harvest to achieve its goals of becoming the go-to place for everyone to park their assets and become the largest globally accessible autonomous hedge fund.\n\nBoth plans are available here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11A0NPrm3rDtA11WqQGXKQ9bFlFSa6Zbb0Fng5jpM5L0/edit?usp=sharing\n\nOption \ud83c\udf53\nMove to the 1M total supply plan\n\nOption \ud83c\udf52\nMove to the 690,420 total supply plan", "choices": ["\ud83c\udf53 Move to the 1M total supply plan", "\ud83c\udf52 Move to the 690,420 total supply plan"], "start": 1601149200, "end": 1601235600, "snapshot": "10942927", "state": "closed", "author": "0x252E7E8B9863f81798B1fEF8CfD9741A46De653C", "space": {"id": "harvestfi.eth", "name": "Harvest Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
