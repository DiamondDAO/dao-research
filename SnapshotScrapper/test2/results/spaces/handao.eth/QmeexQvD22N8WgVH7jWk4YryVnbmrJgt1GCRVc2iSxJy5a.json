{"id": "QmeexQvD22N8WgVH7jWk4YryVnbmrJgt1GCRVc2iSxJy5a", "title": "KlimaDAO", "body": "<Brief Summary>\nKlimaDAO is a project that brings carbon credits on-chain as NFTs, locks them up into a treasury, and issues a token representing claims to the carbon credit tons in the treasury. The token that represents redemption for carbon credit tons is called KLIMA.\n\nOn-chain, tokenized carbon credits are vital to offsetting the carbon emissions of cryptoassets both fungible and non-fungible. Examples of how carbon credit NFTs can be used include creating a Green Bitcoin asset (Bitcoin that has its carbon footprint offset by carbon credit tons) and a Green NFT (an NFT that has its carbon footprint offset by carbon credit tons).\n\nAs more and more carbon credits get locked up in the KlimaDAO treasury, the supply of available carbon credits dramatically is reduced, increasing the value of KLIMA tokens to be used for redemptions for input into systems like the cryptoasset greening initiative.\n\nKlimaDAO is an approved fork of OlympusDAO.\n\n<Sample Use Cases of KlimaDAO>\nAn example of how KlimaDAO carbon credit redemptions would work is by its integration into a greening system for cryptoassets. The Blockchain Infrastructure Carbon Offset Working Group has been designing a system for how cryptoassets (like wrapped Bitcoin) can be greened. KlimaDAO KLIMA tokens for carbon credit NFT redemptions will be vital in this operation of this system. \n\nThe Blockchain Infrastructure Carbon Offset Working Group is comprised of: F2Pool (world\u2019s largest Bitcoin mining pool), stakefish (world leading proof of stake validator), Blockchain for Climate Foundation, Regen Network (cosmos-based carbon credit blockchain), Creol (carbon credit automation marketplace), SZNS (HanDAO portfolio company and NFT index), Ren Protocol (a leading Bitcoin wrapping service), Vega (derivatives protocol; co-founder is a former energy trader).\n\n<Funds Request and Use>\nThe amount requested is $50,000 to purchase pKLIMA which act as redemption tokens for underlying carbon credit NFTs in the KlimaDAO. KLIMA can be staked per the OlympusDAO mechanism (3,3) or sold at a premium \n\n<Relevant Links>\nHanDAO forum link: https://community.handao.org/t/handao-klimadao-investment/48\nwebsite: https://klimadao.finance/\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/KlimaDAO", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1629972000, "end": 1630375200, "snapshot": "13099454", "state": "closed", "author": "0x613E28Fca6a8cd30fad462Df2cE612D413E78CD3", "space": {"id": "handao.eth", "name": "HanDAO"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmeQTp11USwPAYNVb8EBhq9FjWXLC6bkyJrXviuqrW8ebc", "voter": "0xf7763A158c8B523B9D31ad3313Df4E15B5cCC620", "created": 1630309869, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "handao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmae9fdMMFqMDDArVe857CoebXEkwFpEPPYbZ2VDLiwFSp", "voter": "0x4aDf0dbc8bB29A61BE114C22879202A76790C9d9", "created": 1630224131, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "handao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNTPKiPZtHhTvBVJrHKrR21AJ1xrH88sz17oVQw3jNQWU", "voter": "0x570103a510fEa0625D480387cA09a645b2EE8493", "created": 1630089422, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "handao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWne312r1VHdRaw8nnp4NZ8niAHNyGKy6yUvxUTRHb72G", "voter": "0x9286Cd8de8c4e1B5b29b0278493E8BA32356bB7A", "created": 1630047577, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "handao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY1kF9dUVWVjTrZDKCrP66aEDayPxTX58D3bNJ2cHDLBQ", "voter": "0x8B6ec2Cf7E3bE432f25ae7A587c2903ec595D859", "created": 1630035429, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "handao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbv31xy8C1NbL5pfwasjW83qRTJaiJUCQgvFcxqHaL5B1", "voter": "0xCDEE8D33515253084935F2b96036c05e91b3526f", "created": 1630023943, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "handao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdfVvubEiyvJ3LNpv9YqTZmtZ6AHfZMDtGUU5N2s3EgVR", "voter": "0x613E28Fca6a8cd30fad462Df2cE612D413E78CD3", "created": 1630002685, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "handao.eth"}}]}
