The liquidity program will cover both tokens, a Curve pool for the stable instrument and Uniswap for the share token.\n\n# Purpose\n\n### Liquidity\n\nUnlike V1, V2 does not directly require liquidity to stay stable. However we do want to bootstrap a small amount of liquidity as a showcase to potential partners that the new ESD stablecoin is live and safe under real-world conditions. Once ESD is more widely used in protocols, these incentives should no longer be necessary. To bridge this gap, we propose allocation 33,000,000 ESDS as a linear drip over the next year to bootstrap the ESD Curve market.\n\nAdditionally, we propose allocating 16,500,000 ESDS to bootstrap liquidity to the ESDS-ESD Uniswap market so that there is at least a minimal amount of day one liquidity to ease volatility during the migration process. This should also similarly be a temporary measure, and should therefore have a similar drip schedule.\n\n### Treasury\n\nOur community treasury has been incredibly successful in aligning ecosystem contributors. Since we no longer have an expansion tax, we\u2019d like to re-up the treasury as part of the V2 launch so that we can continue funding additional contributions.\n\nWe\u2019d like to propose allocating 49,500,000 ESDS to the treasury at this time as a lump sum, with the intention of allocating follow up grants to the treasury as needed via on-chain governance in the future.\n\n## Impact on Tokenomics\nBelow represents effects of this proposal + the protocol partnerships incentives w/ DeFi Pulse on the total supply of ESD tokens at V2 launch. This proposal concerns the yellow portion of the pie graph. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pLdunE3.png)\n\n*Note: the proposal for the red segment has passed.* \n\n## Specifics\n\n#### Incentivizer [Curve ESD]\n\nAddress: TBD at deployment\n\nAmount: 33,000,000 ESDS\n\nDrip schedule: Linearly over one year from deployment, modifiable through on-chain governance\n\n#### Incentivizer [Uniswap ESD-ESDS]\n\nAddress: TBD at deployment\n\nAmount: 16,500,000 ESDS\n\nDrip schedule: Linearly over one year from deployment, modifiable through on-chain governance\n\n#### Treasury\n\nAddress: 0x460661bd4A5364A3ABCc9cfc4a8cE7038d05Ea22\n\nAmount: 49,500,000 ESDS\n\nVesting schedule: None", "choices": ["Pass this proposal", "Reject this proposal"], "start": 1623700800, "end": 1623960000, "snapshot": "12633713", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB0B2b405c9D09d129E9F9b18c9DD218c532f2b2A", "space": {"id": "esd.eth", "name": "Empty Set"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZinZah7ijjXSkBTsPNW48rPyKepiFF2wyz6Nv2C1zJbf", "voter": "0x7b7F60489E1d39C2A9C1527514c9126c9395E84E", "created": 1623946388, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmenuxnwxpXqwJhwpXP8iZLTRFrpQRqdzbcr6dXi16wLE2", "voter": "0x102e0BEe3da1b393C5E898F433DD5787B80f67b5", "created": 1623894986, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ5rbYphCoz1ikYHNTrXmNiAgxjkTLNvPLzg9M34znuA6", "voter": "0x37Ed74A0dA66c0392C4c5901c3b3B97675871FE1", "created": 1623781920, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYSzZYiTNRbhLTK4pHQBo5ANeaTfK7qoUNePPWVBh7jq3", "voter": "0x2d19f32620F647d08Fa8B9a0FA5206fAE15C0ED5", "created": 1623736544, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcVCfSEbkLTPUH8sT3BvinZpo3hANa9YWvdZ4QyGPQNYy", "voter": "0xF44B52C11b1c800722E8fDF4aa7F3076339E73c4", "created": 1623716152, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPEHnQnbd4GEnzzGfGBitPohsgUXJaC5YBgZYMhAzmJSS", "voter": "0x1200Eb4fA3dF9903fC6EfF1d7A4a5D17502329b2", "created": 1623710012, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}]}
