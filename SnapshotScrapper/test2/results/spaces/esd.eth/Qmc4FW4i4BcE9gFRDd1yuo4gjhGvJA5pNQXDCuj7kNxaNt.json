They offer a strong mix  of experience and development expertise to help the protocol grow.\n\n### Members\n\n**Kevin Britz** - Kevin is an Engineering Manager at  Coinbase focusing on DeFi, and an advisor to Opyn. Previously he  co-founded Astro which was acquired by Coinbase.\n\n**Arjun Rao** - Arjun is a Tech Lead at Coinbase focusing on DeFi. Previously he co-founded Astro alongside Kevin.\n\n**Niraj Pant** - Niraj is a General Partner at Polychain and formerly a researcher in the decentralized systems lab at UIUC.\n\n## Funding\n\nAs the ecosystem core protocol team, Equilibria will be granted `99 000 000 ESS`, vesting linearly for 2 years, in an unvested-revocable contract.\n\nEquilibria Multisig: `0x589CDCf60aea6B961720214e80b713eB66B89A4d`", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1626436800, "end": 1626609600, "snapshot": "12837051", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB0B2b405c9D09d129E9F9b18c9DD218c532f2b2A", "space": {"id": "esd.eth", "name": "Empty Set"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qma1DmNZFmxwa3K2RHPy9DKJLuvBJ3jo6dCzM1LuPnh33s", "voter": "0xb9F795D0B98Ad3830c48C9D56cE844E593C99503", "created": 1626597334, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTDrC2wNjhE1n2MeZumsfXf1qzRYKLEeyD49hjUZSeV6F", "voter": "0x1acF3E6e5fb8f5D53469c15b48550bbCFeb22bfc", "created": 1626549951, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQqoVwgtD9BzABRbTeMzCvi53BSJxWZVRjVYJhVCWDfHG", "voter": "0x7b7F60489E1d39C2A9C1527514c9126c9395E84E", "created": 1626501894, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX4r2GP5jRVFTJeFi3dpGY1Ljqs5Czrhyct3azKntx7jH", "voter": "0xffff0c6FEBddBAb590Ad077096d87cE806aaCe47", "created": 1626467390, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdD6xKoh8K7haFSXVKwQv8MiNxq6QCHTDGK3uiP7x3feg", "voter": "0xd6Fd705EE0B31a9300D3E2154bccE777270CBb6f", "created": 1626466150, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}]}
