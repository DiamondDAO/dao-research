This grant requests funds to cover  continued development of the new DAO web app, continued communications,  governance support, community management and continued development of  the documentation.\n\n## Last Grant\u2019s Roundup\n\nWith the last grant we continued work on the communications,  governance and community activities as well as the development of the  new DAO app.\n\nThe last grant wrapped up at the end of April and it was decided  while the project was being audited and tested that I wouldn't make  sense to continue full time on the protocol until we were ready to go.  The lead up to August saw a lot of activity and now the protocol has  launched we are back into it.\n\n## Areas of Focus\n\nBelow are the following areas where SN2 will focus on over the next two months.\n\n#### 1. Development of the ESD DAO web application - lewi\n\n**Aim:** To continue development of the new ESD DAO web  application. Integrating the V2 contracts, testing, debugging and  refactoring code\n\n#### 2. Communications - Shauhin\n\n**Aim** : Improve the presence of ESD within the DeFi  community and develop communications processes to ensure the ESD  community is always up-to date.\n\n#### 3. Documentation - lewi\n\n**Aim** : Develop supporting material for v2 of the protocol.\n\n#### 4. Governance Coordination - lewi\n\n**Aim** : Actively facilitate the On/Off-chain governance processes and deployment of contracts for proposals.\n\n#### 5. Integration Assistance & Partnerships - lewi\n\n**Aim** : Guide protocols through the governance process & be a technical resource for the integration of ESD.\n\n#### 6. Community Management - lewi, Shauhin\n\n**Aim** : Help manage the different community platforms that Empty Set has. Ensuring an up-to date & inclusive community\n\n## Spending and Rollovers\n\nThe previous months had minimal spend as we were waiting to launch the V2 contracts.\n\n**Total Spend: 0 USD**\n\n**Total Remaining to Rollover: 5000 USD**\n\n## Funding Request\n\nWe estimate we will require the following funds for the two months:\n ![img](https://i.imgur.com/vIAC6ZA.png)\n\nThe funds will be split into two payments to `0x750eb0759F56a55cF0bb528fe4EFc6f8cFd27C56` . The first tranche immediately after the vote passes and the second at the beginning of February (minus the rollover funds).\n\nAs always the remainder from the end of the grant will be either:\n\n- Rolled into the next successful proposal for SN2\n- Sent back to the Treasury if the following proposal fails.", "choices": ["Yes, continue to fund", "No, stop funding"], "start": 1629808200, "end": 1629981000, "snapshot": "13088121", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB0B2b405c9D09d129E9F9b18c9DD218c532f2b2A", "space": {"id": "esd.eth", "name": "Empty Set"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSYSqCkx6cJDGyt3nwKwCEw43ih1WYt3Q8kLqiYTmLPiN", "voter": "0x0B500FF8fb95571145e8A9dF5d229A5fc7E558D3", "created": 1629881696, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVkbCAEvSkcHA81eqDDFjGjqqMDPQSTXnUGRXmhCryBoY", "voter": "0x37Ed74A0dA66c0392C4c5901c3b3B97675871FE1", "created": 1629867340, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR9f8wavxNptRtxCpKzaSS8H79xujkXWzKgEqvKgFMP7n", "voter": "0x0b7376f2a063C771D460210a4Fa8787C9A7379f9", "created": 1629837066, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmezZAZd1PrqTuPyAySdBnNt736hTP19Wuf4ze2Q9y9hNM", "voter": "0x357dfdC34F93388059D2eb09996d80F233037cBa", "created": 1629819741, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmabnfUcNkD4fsZzNe6dGQPPiW6WUobrDMEAkbT8Cg6GXa", "voter": "0xB0B2b405c9D09d129E9F9b18c9DD218c532f2b2A", "created": 1629809587, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}]}
