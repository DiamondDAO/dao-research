This proposal looks to further align the squad with the protocol by allocating them tokens subject to  vesting. This revocable & vested token allocation would align S#2 as a protocol partner and provide strong performance incentives.\n\n# Purpose\n\nMembers of the S#2 team has been active in the ESD community since  early in the protocol\u2019s life. As it matured their involvement was  formalized into S#2 to help support them support the protocol and its  community.\n\nThrough the moniker of S#2, the squad has taken on a number of  responsibilities to help the day to day of the protocol run smoothly:  communications, governance facilitation, development, community  management & other things to grease the wheels.\n\nAs V2 launches, the S#2 is looking to move from a purely  transactional partner to protocol partner. So instead of a solely grant  based relationship, S#2 will be allocated vested tokens alongside the  current grant process. Taking the relationship a step further improves  alignment with the protocol and incentivises success.\n\n# Tokens\n\nThe partnership includes `33,000,000 ESS` vested linearly over 2 years.\n\nThe unvested tokens in the vesting contract may be burned or sent to  the treasury via a governance action by the protocol in situations the  community deems necessary.\n\n## Wallet\n\n**S#2 Wallet:** 0x750eb0759F56a55cF0bb528fe4EFc6f8cFd27C56\n\n**Vesting:** Linear vesting schedule in a contract owned by the DAO", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1626465600, "end": 1626638400, "snapshot": "12839338", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB0B2b405c9D09d129E9F9b18c9DD218c532f2b2A", "space": {"id": "esd.eth", "name": "Empty Set"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYDEpWaEC4UpSBhSeGUshJrsW7YLbNsV9U86jszWzhr7G", "voter": "0xF44B52C11b1c800722E8fDF4aa7F3076339E73c4", "created": 1626618583, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT1vEKaL6yoPQTPw6PvtP33JorTkz3ybUqNNFikHuZVuj", "voter": "0xb9F795D0B98Ad3830c48C9D56cE844E593C99503", "created": 1626597309, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPoRoMVL5CXUi9fAYREGMFM8BJtM2BfMKU3gfWEJYJpUB", "voter": "0x37Ed74A0dA66c0392C4c5901c3b3B97675871FE1", "created": 1626568125, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmePT5dNSUW4saXxP2pkAd7QhjKY3NKu71KMVd71AUHG5m", "voter": "0x1acF3E6e5fb8f5D53469c15b48550bbCFeb22bfc", "created": 1626549980, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWEir8HuQBGxt4qiojKXfqHJGV4Pnn9HWf9Rqu6tnfuHT", "voter": "0x7b7F60489E1d39C2A9C1527514c9126c9395E84E", "created": 1626501916, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme5kLRUWedu9GE3V56xb9PMb2WpEQKepMHrAezAQro27U", "voter": "0x069e85D4F1010DD961897dC8C095FBB5FF297434", "created": 1626475172, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUFZm5zXhLcNe8X7hKSqHFTGC9rmnSLRk5NyzeASbWPdd", "voter": "0xffff0c6FEBddBAb590Ad077096d87cE806aaCe47", "created": 1626467484, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdWiAzRQUkGog3ekuNpSnE62SJgMAGBicrUSktqpBgk9Z", "voter": "0xd6Fd705EE0B31a9300D3E2154bccE777270CBb6f", "created": 1626466203, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "esd.eth"}}]}
