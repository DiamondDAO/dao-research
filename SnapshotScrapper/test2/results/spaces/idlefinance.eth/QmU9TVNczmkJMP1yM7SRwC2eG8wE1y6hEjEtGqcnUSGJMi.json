The number of selected contributors can be rounded up if a part-time candidate achieves the top position (in this case, League would accept 2 part-time members or up to 1.5 full-time members).\n\nThe minimum voting threshold for a candidate to be elected is 10\u2019000 IDLE votes. \nIf candidates do not fully cover open positions (e.g., only a part-time contributor reaches the threshold), Leagues might reopen the application window for new candidates that want to join in the next mandate.\n\nThis Temperature Check complies with the [stkIDLE Voting Framework](https://gov.idle.finance/t/voting-framework-for-stkidle-holders/567). \n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\n\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n### Vote options\n* Elect @kayleebushell\n* Elect @Biaf\n* None of the above\n\nFor this election we are using Snapshot with the \u201cWeighted voting\u201d strategy, allowing voters to distribute their voting weight across different options.
