If Governance will approve this proposal, the idleFEI pool will then be included in the $IDLE liquidity mining program and will dynamically receive $IDLE depending on TVL and APY of the pool.\n\n$IDLE liquidity mining would allow Idle to attract a wide potential target market ($500m circulating supply). At the same time, the extension of $IDLE governance ownership to FEI LPs would represent a way to incentivize participation in the upcoming idleFEI tranches, built on top of the Best-Yield strategy.\n\nThe Fei community will then have access to the \u201cneutral\u201d Best-Yield, \u201cprotected\u201d Senior Tranche, and \u201cleveraged\u201d Junior Tranche, expanding the suite of yield optimization products.\n\nThe collaboration with Fei DAO could further incentivize liquidity provision thanks to [TRIBE Liquidity Mining](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tribe-liquidity-mining-emission-schedule/3549) distributed via Tribal Chief Programs. Lastly, Fei DAO could also consider Idle as a yield source for its [$1b PCV allocation](https://app.fei.money/analytics), which is mainly deposited in Aave and Compound. \n\n\n### Details\nThe technical implementation will be developed by Dev League.\n\nActions:\n* idleFEI liquidity mining activation: 2 actions\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve $IDLE liquidity mining activation on IdleFEI\n**AGAINST**: Vote against $IDLE liquidity mining activation on IdleFEI\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST", "DISCUSS MORE"], "start": 1635339600, "end": 1635512400, "snapshot": "13499550", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540", "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth", "name": "Idle"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUgonDKAnVQjhtfoUq171TuJ8Go5knKBQEtviXzhRockM", "voter": "0x818d50B2083A75bE8189279aB3Dc4cc5d2A4Eac5", "created": 1635421032, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe4d3663d0204db4378aaa47f8cc72e3490c228c438ea8485a485ad12573711c7", "voter": "0xC29A440e4BbBb506949eDb7F76DF06d76A7BB0b2", "created": 1635365486, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "0xeb9c9e8ca636b19216dae615b6d51fb064289a8bd20da687df6ef3ea3c30da59", "voter": "0xEF868D7eDCf872a964FF4C59bDeD37F906085695", "created": 1635362443, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "0x57efd8e43ca6443eb211b45bb861ea2db0afc49220cb198a8990710ce5ad6741", "voter": "0x2bC44F6c34d9200C258AC07A56D81963d4f92c4c", "created": 1635340384, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}]}
