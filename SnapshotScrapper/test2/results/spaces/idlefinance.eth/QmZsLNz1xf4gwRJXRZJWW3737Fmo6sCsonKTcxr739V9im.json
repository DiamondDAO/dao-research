There are two possible options to set the poll\u2019s thresholds that make on-chain vote broadcasting valid.\nWhen [off-chain polls](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) are launched, an [off-chain poll for stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth) will mirror the off-chain question. This proposed solution would aggregate the stkIDLE votes with the ones cast by $IDLE token holders.\n\n### Motivation\nWith the launch of $IDLE staking, stakers have no more access to voting features.\nTo enable the on-chain voting option, the governance tokens deposited into the staking contract are delegated to a community multisig.\nThe implementation of an ad-hoc off-chain voting strategy lets stkIDLE holders cast their preference for on-chain proposals, and a community multisig is in charge of on-chain vote broadcasting once the off-chain polls reach the thresholds, voting with its entire balance.\n\nThe same off-chain ad-hoc voting strategy can be used to let stkIDLE holders cast their preference for off-chain polls.\n\n### Details\nON-CHAIN VOTES\n**Voting strategy**: [stkIDLE holders voting space](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\n**Threshold to make the poll valid**:\n- *Option 1*: low quorum (30% of stkIDLE) but high consensus (70%+ on the same choice). This option would require a minimum of 21% of stkIDLE voting the same thing. A lower barrier to entry would allow the Governance to reach the 520,000 $IDLE quorum on on-chain proposals easily. Drawback: a tiny group can potentially pivot a large number of votes.\n- *Option 2*: high quorum (60% of stkIDLE) but low consensus (51% on the same choice). This option would require a minimum of 31% of stkIDLE voting the same thing. Benefit: the parameters require a large voting base, so the final vote can not be influenced by few individuals.\nDrawback: if the poll does not meet the quorum, the vote is not broadcasted and this voting power can not help the Governance reaching the 520,000 $IDLE quorum.\n**Voting weight**: 100% of the staked $IDLE voting weight\n\nOFF-CHAIN VOTES\n**Voting strategy**: [stkIDLE holders voting space](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\n**Threshold to make the poll valid**: no quorum required\n**Voting weight**: the voting stkIDLE amount is calculated in the form of weighted IDLE tokens using the formula: \u201ctotal IDLE staked / total stkIDLE minted * total stkIDLE voting the snapshot * % of each option\u201d\n\nThe sum of the voting weights cast by $IDLE and stkIDLE holders represents the final snapshot results.\n\nThis poll is the first one launched for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**OPTION 1**: Approve option 1 for on-chain stkIDLE vote broadcasting and the proposed solution for off-chain polls\n**OPTION 2**: Approve option 2 for on-chain stkIDLE vote broadcasting and the proposed solution for off-chain polls\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the on-chain and off-chain Voting Framework for stkIDLE holders\n**AGAINST**: Not proceed with this proposal\n", "choices": ["OPTION 1", "OPTION 2", "DISCUSS MORE", "AGAINST"], "start": 1627918200, "end": 1628177400, "snapshot": "12946566", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540", "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth", "name": "Idle"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmbbUVwLyR1Ed89KBeRBGSBsrJ3w2wA15sVHMmQA649MLJ", "voter": "0x50eE80E8a86D50B8e7f302B23bB666a4f5d89e4A", "created": 1628080923, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUFK6B6wRLEydu5J7efvEMS57y4FFMB2b4rQLsasLEJi1", "voter": "0x1929A0454cDD4d925E8Fc9b6c366ECD7844866F2", "created": 1628079314, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmaeg9GrcCqY4YSAwtarXK9cZsgqFR9WF22G9jgXQza3uU", "voter": "0x62D6d2c1dDeeA9b2E9c26A8B4edF7042ab81C419", "created": 1628078995, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQPe9fSSYxkoQQxjXiuEYScVcyAF5cGrZ5yo9AT3jV7QB", "voter": "0x34AAa3D5A73D6f9594326d0422ce69748F09b14F", "created": 1628038753, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWcNG7gUEho7TVWZhUWV6mtbtsoNjim9iLhbq97g7BeEE", "voter": "0x2bC44F6c34d9200C258AC07A56D81963d4f92c4c", "created": 1628004333, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWScJwTTv3t3HTqdv3UvZTTettQxxzNRAnj64jrkKTrb6", "voter": "0x50DA03C08b3269AA2B47a0b8bE03dBCeA4cB3990", "created": 1628003255, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYf4mJare16FYH5QyVHGxzp8oS4iPU7F9YBmMqEt9eiLb", "voter": "0xb373F5f09d9875b94661776201165D01a7AE7bF7", "created": 1627998728, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcESHUmPkRkS4CYx9hCfk8rh1pbuqDbM4t8uwst3dqczk", "voter": "0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540", "created": 1627918507, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}]}
