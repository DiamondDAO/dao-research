The deal would onboard strategic partners, such as proactive contributors that can guide mutual integrations between protocols and act as bridges between DeFi and B2B/D2D partners or institutional capital.\n\nThe Idle DAO has a strong community-first ethos, a continuously growing product suite (millions in TVL and ecosystem partnerships growing daily), with new products being delivered systematically and pragmatically with high-security standards, and a skillful, talented, and forward-looking Leagues team.\n\nWe must continue to add value to users and partners. Diversifying now allows us to grow the Idle Leagues structure and to keep stable operations through DeFi market evolution and maturation, and the actions herein will allow Idle to keep growing steadily.\n\nThe purpose of this poll is to gauge community sentiment and move forward with deal specifications and partners\u2019 contact.\n\n\n### Details\n\nThe diversification of a small part of the Governance funds would bring the following benefits:\n* **Capital efficiency**, by partially or deploying the stablecoin reserve into Idle pools;\n* **Fund expenditures** such as rebalancing and protocol maintenance costs using a non-volatile asset.\n* **Long-term sustainability and risk mitigation** to continue to thrive, even during non-favorable market situations, guaranteeing resources for League scaling over the next 2-3 years.\n* **Venture League** set up an investment arm that would use part of the resource to fund strategic DeFi projects and teams in their early stage. This unit would work towards sponsoring deeper DAO2DAO relationships, allowing Idle to become an active participant in other protocol's ecosystems.\n* **Improve visibility** and reputation in the DeFi landscape, standing out with the backup of additional solid strategic partners.\n\nThe Governance will further define those specs during the fundraising phase. The parameters outlined in the treasury diversification post are not set in stone and do not represent a binding decision. The current poll is not voting to approve them, but it represents only the intention of the Idle DAO to proceed with treasury diversification\n\n### Voting Options\n\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n\n**FOR**: Proceed with this initiative\n**AGAINST**: Not proceed with this initiative\n\n", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST"], "start": 1623799800, "end": 1623969000, "snapshot": "12641610", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9993ADB62085AcB05Fc493f7A1D10C11227A78fa", "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth", "name": "Idle"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmaFCNiG7eE8BWrjTkhbRQuagx74GNd9GsaWDAogJyne7J", "voter": "0xE20F40A5b3d44189d12fb09Be60226F734082D86", "created": 1623941611, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRu65DSCLr5FbZFKtrt8uWm5xDrb7QbBpUbUAiRyyrynf", "voter": "0xb7FeE4f0e877A348481355FFf757D8A079A2A48b", "created": 1623895232, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbnxTuE1EQQFf7EZp6vCdVoWd8wQy55EPE61XjQvf5S52", "voter": "0x2bC44F6c34d9200C258AC07A56D81963d4f92c4c", "created": 1623881735, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYgD3r9oRpo1NtwA8raKoCbnbjPdHpCUmMc2oJXkN7Toy", "voter": "0x5395020b599312b462D3A7f12819710837c39E35", "created": 1623881119, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZFGZfvwEuiRVwopjajctZR1bZN2qU2hc193Su9G3XsF1", "voter": "0x4D904df422Ec729d627A289D6913c34D8c347b1D", "created": 1623845193, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbu5xZwLcAgtPiy98AVjLsXKrVWB2TZoUCxmSz772P4gB", "voter": "0x50eE80E8a86D50B8e7f302B23bB666a4f5d89e4A", "created": 1623845126, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdiAE9mHUyzW3VU1qETV2EAVjphtiTUqiHYwA6acnBnoW", "voter": "0x5485623Ac7e4F38cC0B3979F4E7BB916BBdB3D88", "created": 1623832843, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUHNhggH6T5GRcaK8pfYU2XjJSBh3JMmTH4qXPjpgcbmw", "voter": "0x5bCfC2dee33fBD19771d4063C15cFB6dD555bb4C", "created": 1623811014, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}]}
