All users are strongly encouraged to close any open position and withdraw from all lending pools before the Close Date.\n\nIdle [tokenized dYdX Layer1 positions](https://developers.idle.finance/advanced/yxtoken-dydx-tokenization) to allow users to earn interest on DAI and USDC, and that source is currently used by Idle strategies.\nWith the upcoming wind-down, Idle Governance should proceed with dYdX support removal.\n\nIn that scenario, DAI and USDC pools will deploy funds only across Aave and Compound.\n\nThe [forum post](https://gov.idle.finance/t/dydx-deactivation/695) analyses Fuse, highlights the lack of pools able to host Idle\u2019s liquidity without affecting our risk profile. Fuse support on DAI and USDC is not part of this Temperature Check.\n\n### Details\nThe technical implementation will be developed by Dev League.\n\nActions:\n* dYdX removal from Best-Yield DAI and USDC pools: 2 actions\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve DyDx deactivation\n**AGAINST**: Vote against DyDx deactivation\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST", "DISCUSS MORE"], "start": 1635339600, "end": 1635512400, "snapshot": "13499509", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540", "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth", "name": "Idle"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x2d4e3a4d6780c1bc4a1b85c0c3e7095390129e999e084e51cdd85c7684c15aaa", "voter": "0xC29A440e4BbBb506949eDb7F76DF06d76A7BB0b2", "created": 1635361893, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe1aa24ef0811eaa38e5dec1bcb4762fe235c6b58bd491a2dfeea7d06b64beb50", "voter": "0x2bC44F6c34d9200C258AC07A56D81963d4f92c4c", "created": 1635340658, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}]}
