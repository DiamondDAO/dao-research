The attacker used a complex blend of collateral/borrow transactions and inflated the price of yUSD to game Cream collateralization ratio and leave a $130m underwater loan.\nTechnical analysis of the attack is available [here](https://mudit.blog/cream-hack-analysis/).\n\nThe [Integration Standard Requirements](https://gov.idle.finance/t/integration-standard-requirements/513) evaluate losses on a case-by-case basis. Hacks directly related to protocol\u2019s smart contracts represent a red flag, especially when there are no mitigation mechanisms and the maximum stolen amount is equal to the protocol\u2019s TVL, like in this case.\nFollowing this incident, Cream can no longer be compatible with Idle\u2019s risk profile and Leagues propose to remove it from idleFEI (the only pool supporting it).\n\nThere are no material risks on Idle side, as the rebalancer already paused any possible Cream deposit, but this proposal would finalize the protocol deactivation.\n\n### Details\nThe technical implementation will be developed by Dev League.\n\nActions:\n* Remove Cream protocol from idleFEI: 1 action\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve Cream removal from IdleFEI\n**AGAINST**: Vote against Cream removal from IdleFEI\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST", "DISCUSS MORE"], "start": 1635760800, "end": 1635933600, "snapshot": "13530854", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540", "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth", "name": "Idle"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x720b4bd150b236219074c2546cd0e30c8d54e159d4f070c93cb090bf6ab0615c", "voter": "0xC29A440e4BbBb506949eDb7F76DF06d76A7BB0b2", "created": 1635880923, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "0x44fd969cc1148c10e43cea947cb68564b06d3119fe7994d21d1941e79e2434fc", "voter": "0x2bC44F6c34d9200C258AC07A56D81963d4f92c4c", "created": 1635853030, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYQTRsgaxxeSodnHEJzsXit5DHUjgSQuM6UyK8a1WYHJr", "voter": "0xDB478114EB8301A7acE35513c3312C1EEB8D99d0", "created": 1635839482, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc78be426ba4f4efd2628888319d56421fc786e23e0ab783907f755bc5479476c", "voter": "0xe4a94f336988dF07220C2Ec18672B2AbBcd02351", "created": 1635783290, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}]}
