The number of selected contributors can be rounded up if a part-time candidate achieves the top position (in this case, League would accept 2 part-time members or up to 1.5 full-time members).\" With the current voting results (IDLE + stkIDLE), the full-time open position for Treasury League members would be filled by @Biaf. \n\nFurthermore, two points must be highlighted:\n1) Her application post had the focus also on the Business Development area, and given the recent managed initiatives (e.g. Polygon), this role is becoming more and more crucial for the League.\nSo Kaylee, in this case, would cover a Treasury League need.\n\n2) Being a Part-time, Junior application, her compensation, added to that of @Biaf (which is a Mid-level), would have no further impact on costs because the sum of the compensations corresponds to what is already allocated for a Senior figure compensation.\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n\nFOR: Proceed with the proposal\nAGAINST: Not proceed with the proposal", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST"], "start": 1630317600, "end": 1630526400, "snapshot": "13128919", "state": "closed", "author": "0xf27d7e8E96e891D77F42E1d88dA872A1cFaFe91a", "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth", "name": "Idle"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmc8UZXiVGgB9Aj4jmi7XbbuyxsP16CphuyV2o1WnVPHJ6", "voter": "0x50DA03C08b3269AA2B47a0b8bE03dBCeA4cB3990", "created": 1630410144, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNx2Yz8AaQyfT2spTHEmxNCdCSRbFqm7zLWArQibVwwxa", "voter": "0x2bC44F6c34d9200C258AC07A56D81963d4f92c4c", "created": 1630409146, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaTQqpCXzVVTsfhqd316rGChb5CbrFsLbcB6jDZAEqkaV", "voter": "0x237e01Ae458A6Db3370E2977fDbf620f392053E5", "created": 1630393846, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSjkhKb1AkTwJWY96oLVp5KJ1iktMq9UinDn9SkUwCKQb", "voter": "0x78A8d0d7D89Dfc326e2AaFfEBb74bc7b310aBA25", "created": 1630383561, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTvq35oWFNMTqJsyvmPkpSjB1E3xRBAjfwRE51yaK9Mvz", "voter": "0x34AAa3D5A73D6f9594326d0422ce69748F09b14F", "created": 1630383435, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "idlefinance.eth"}}]}
