Therefore we propose to enable $IDLE farming for the RAI pool. The idleRAI pool will then be included in the $IDLE liquidity mining program, dynamically receiving $IDLE depending on TVL and APY of the pool.\nCurrently RAI incentives Idle with Reflexer (see details [here](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-distros/blob/master/all_distros.md) ). Idle\u2019s Liquidity Mining program linearly distributes 2,340,000 IDLE (0.5 IDLE per block) until 26th November 2022. We therefore would like to officialize the ongoing Reflexer rewards program for the same duration as our liquidity mining program. IdleRAI depositors would then be able to receive both $IDLE and $FLX rewards until the end of Idle's Liquidity Mining program. \n\nThis Temperature Check complies with the [stkIDLE Voting Framework](https://gov.idle.finance/t/voting-framework-for-stkidle-holders/567). This poll is available for both $IDLE token holders and stkIDLE holders. The final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**Voting Options**\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options to decide if we enable IDLE farming in the RAI pool:\n1.
