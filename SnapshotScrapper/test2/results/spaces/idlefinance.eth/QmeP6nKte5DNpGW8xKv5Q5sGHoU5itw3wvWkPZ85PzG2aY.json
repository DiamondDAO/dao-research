The process will consist of an initial application bounty to test Solidity development skills, with a following Governance & League election to include the new member in the team. \n\nSelected applicants will enter a 3-week sprint phase, where they would receive the midpoint compensation for their seniority level. After this bootstrap sprint, Supervisors will define the final compensation package. In this timeframe, SVs have the right to upgrade/downgrade if it\u2019s clear that the proposed seniority level is not matched.\n\nEach address can only vote for one choice and it is not possible to split the voting power (this is how the current Snapshot polls work). Note that you can change your vote at any moment, therefore if the name you chose is already in the top positions, you can switch the selection and pick another preferred profile.\n\n### Other References:\n- [A Step Towards Idle Leagues \u2013 Dev & Treasury](https://gov.idle.finance/t/a-step-towards-idle-leagues-dev-treasury/419) \n- [About Idle Leagues](https://idlefinance.medium.com/about-idle-leagues-73fa538f18e5)\n\n### Vote Options\nA candidate is successfully elected if reached at least 10\u2019000 IDLE votes.
