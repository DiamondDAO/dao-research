{"id": "QmcXKE9Kw77reTQecoUHkevFsfUxEoHe29NjP3FCpZrEdZ", "title": "Should I quit my job?", "body": "I work making a 6-figure salary at a large tech company. I'm considering leaving my job- I'm doing well here, but I'd like to move on and try new opportunities. The thing is I don't have anything in particular lined up; I was basically thinking I would mess around for six months or so. I have a few things I'd like to get into:\n\n- Getting more into Ethereum development. I've been helping out with a small Ethereum project and enjoying it, I'd like to explore this some more.\n- Learn Russian; I've been trying to learn to speak Russian but it's difficult to do with a full time job. I think I could make a lot of progress by devoting 10-20 hours a week to this.\n- Generally decompressing from a stressful job. I share an on-call rotation, and even outside of the oncall there are often pressing production issues to deal with.\n\nOn the other hand, there are good reasons to stay at my job:\n- I make a lot of money. (My partner's job can get me covered for healthcare, though.)\n- I'm being encouraged to work towards a promotion. Within 1-2 years I believe I could reach the role of Senior Software Developer.\n\nShould I quit my job, work on random things online, then get another real job later this year? Or should I stick with what I have now?\n\n_(Quorum is set to 0.70 kiancoin; if less than 70% of kiancoin participates in this poll, the decision is nonbinding.)_", "choices": ["Quit your job", "Stay as is"], "start": 1616626800, "end": 1617037200, "snapshot": "12104493", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5295b474F3A0bB39418456c96D6FCf13901A4aA1", "space": {"id": "kian.eth", "name": "kiancoin"}, "votes": 18, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmaEg4xvQ8BBgPbbmCohKbuHkMmLXqaSuhwWJmG7HEgjbf", "voter": "0x2d4eC0C8616A39103a062c16281E78C99e0a50E1", "created": 1616704766, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNjgKVhyqiwYqgKtdeVGH47qicERMnJKyAuSmzKr85FoB", "voter": "0x860C4604Fe1125Ea43F81E613E7AFb2Aa49546AA", "created": 1616666198, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmatrmpkkwQkVtFJkMSr2EPGEFF1qfvmd7RkW3MjpY6wWd", "voter": "0x08B4249c79215FDd6a048AF43E9fF86b9ee6Be2e", "created": 1616647610, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRqPwbHZDsLPpm32EkDD4PXfgb7Bd53osytQQummXbscA", "voter": "0xD7D91d77506bDDBD86ABfC5158aF587c75068afd", "created": 1616636720, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmars1AAdRWZcHX7yH53TmhjrD3ksfuo1gAUZoEvJVh4jS", "voter": "0x73Bd1162e9DA1b551d4601Acf83158F3AC2247A9", "created": 1616635509, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaAsYKrLtbmA9Ms9VLtynTYGNCcdrkUW4ucsRrwXCWnWd", "voter": "0xFf82289231128Fc6F185137f445D34E30D036c98", "created": 1616635418, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWUW3GYSBb63ThpWWTkjY1xMosMDp2W5zegq7razDTvuW", "voter": "0x4FC9dDfc545b92e57a50231d1ea2F21870921e8C", "created": 1616634654, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcKUXpU6Zk2gx5o5EkDUXRXGmEPX9g5dNhCmyUJD3rmrA", "voter": "0xEA72D4635D7509984bB145844608441FDd111179", "created": 1616634345, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT63Nj6FUdGZHDwRkW6oesBS9HfP9B3nQU2XybWcR34LQ", "voter": "0xbdb6EB461e9602ab64ca5E805A3906dbc1095250", "created": 1616632898, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNui4QWbb9kUai5N49EeHHGAjReNmn4zN6UW7bwamwDF9", "voter": "0xbC31FdA98eD7CF6dAaf50327d922b78Cbc486d23", "created": 1616632677, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaviuWxKvmdSkZsEm87dRGUKwJgyRaG49Ku4AJMMDfvCx", "voter": "0x122Fed718c784AD25E2a5AB351F034FC57512A48", "created": 1616630324, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdwCPwHouicMT8FEr6p6dbuj482zVZQrZDjhkT637sTEX", "voter": "0x4c71526D3F7b112aAA4c0Af173A6a47aB69D54CD", "created": 1616630200, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYRBMqSiZ9ssWYU82mosvZRe75tDGLoHZVcFpjRJZxMwT", "voter": "0xf46c5CF1164D30f7A09Fb61c495341896Aee32b2", "created": 1616630159, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQXcXRGxz2YbmJ93rUEcKesA9uTixjPDnFdipnY6cBFWK", "voter": "0xe3A2b4da15130C7830862E945A2383f0a29B8BC8", "created": 1616630077, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZAZJpia1yPByKMeWyX4mTLhTPLALQmnc64UvaPNVSWAB", "voter": "0xd819a9239Dfce679Fa5C10fC13367485B09b52cB", "created": 1616629044, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNo1qvPFXwnipxeDhkEUozdP3DK1G86p1o86XBzy9i2TK", "voter": "0x0f78961F03678eb1CC4ED6c57Cc2F8bD8833935C", "created": 1616628905, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeLnvdN9sbnxwDpKYhvehPtrNjPyhNEuGa2iady91kvsd", "voter": "0xfc6F9A3C0Fe29423Ca6B974109817a323998f762", "created": 1616628518, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVeWidXMfLQxjbK3QmvoCHXbDsr8HxAcNtqBzd7fEgAuA", "voter": "0xEd130187D66432b33377F36A4637135a2579c2f5", "created": 1616628453, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}]}
