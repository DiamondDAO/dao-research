Improving kiancoin and finding new use cases. I have a few things to improve: I need to fix a bug with the ***top kiancoin holder*** list on [kiancoin.com](https://kiancoin.com), and I have a few ideas I want to explore, particularly around quadratic voting and incentivizing Uniswap market participation.\n\n2. My car's defroster does not work. I think I know how to fix it (there's a small motor that diverts the airflow from my face to the windshield). It'll be a fair bit of time to investigate what's wrong and take apart my car's dash to get at the problem.\n\n3. Chair pocket. I have this poofy, red rocking chair that I use every day. I love it. I would like to sew a pocket on to the side, maybe using velcro so I can take it off and clean it easily. I'm considering this a big task because I have no idea how to sew but want it to look nice.\n\n4. My job. Instead of doing the above, I could divert my free time into important backlog tasks at work, increasing my visibility within the organization and potentially resulting in salary increases and a promotion in the future.\n\n", "choices": ["improving kiancoin", "car defroster", "chair pocket", "job"], "start": 1611288000, "end": 1611547200, "snapshot": "11703075", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5295b474F3A0bB39418456c96D6FCf13901A4aA1", "space": {"id": "kian.eth", "name": "kiancoin"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQJJtWG5PutQDLxzgobGq7MdaPjKoRqGwMpEsUEPyAcgT", "voter": "0x969B81BBA3a3Eae0FccC78f8b64f012fD823A912", "created": 1611457325, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbvUHxZhCC1maWhRH1Crd69kGmBD69aK8JVemh674PWqR", "voter": "0x3Af14FfAF8d41951f75c415325f342d0A75d6F3d", "created": 1611434452, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ4m4WsRMFk3cKEWyAG4h6ZiagU88TJqHMvb9sTybFqFt", "voter": "0xe3A2b4da15130C7830862E945A2383f0a29B8BC8", "created": 1611351286, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQmR3rFgyxiAVTwLjp8JGxPxYC8qxprYceE2vB8eHdiv8", "voter": "0xfc6F9A3C0Fe29423Ca6B974109817a323998f762", "created": 1611336085, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTZoDiAJAwvWiSDqFFwC7LvRvqjYtbKRyZFCfs8SYZZbs", "voter": "0xc7ec2fe70353d860F37f75299b1FFBB1762938A9", "created": 1611333936, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW4CY1cNqGRuviuKR1WLpSDE7yX3JZT173tM1S87NjTnV", "voter": "0xbC31FdA98eD7CF6dAaf50327d922b78Cbc486d23", "created": 1611290300, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "kian.eth"}}]}
