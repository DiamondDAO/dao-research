And which working group should this be organised under? \n\nPerson 2: \"Oh that should go under workflow and processes but we have not passed the snapshot for that yet. Hmm should  we just put it under vision mission branding?\n\nPerson 3 \"Nah thats disorganised. We really need to get around to making the snapshot for workflow and processes. \n\n/end\n\nWell this is that snapshot. \n\nExamples of how this budget is to be spent. \n\n-Admin-\n\nAdmin of website, YT channel, discord, token streaming, social media accounts, tools, google drive, trello,  MULTISIG*. \n\n*See Fugu's new financial section which is extremely valuable to keep our finances organised. He has done that will zero certainty about getting paid (because there is no budget for that stuff defined) this proposal fixes that. \n\n-Workflow / Processes-\n\nGo checkout the workflow processes channel to see all the stuff we are already working on. And we are only scratching the surface.\n\n70k is max budget for 3 months it does not have to all get spent. It does not mean all of it will be distributed. \n\n\n\n", "choices": ["nah 35k is enough", "70k is good", "No. Peeps should jst work 4 free"], "start": 1635210000, "end": 1635469200, "snapshot": "13489720", "state": "closed", "author": "0x069e85D4F1010DD961897dC8C095FBB5FF297434", "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth", "name": "CRE8R DAO"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xc60a92b8807f1720a89162ab9a439dc918ef8a123293332f3d1383586fb2c0d2", "voter": "0xCFFE08BDf20918007f8Ab268C32f8756494fC8D8", "created": 1635305977, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "0xeb239bcd685f8b711dd38d21cc6e2f83333a0f1ad50a7a9fa6b537bb95d091b4", "voter": "0xB403F791E418E3b7D93C4609C1C4b711061182cd", "created": 1635279125, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQoWdyXArjBB2wxaPt9tYX9cxotc6s8ZQqzP19hT1Z6Bu", "voter": "0x3c5Aac016EF2F178e8699D6208796A2D67557fe2", "created": 1635263677, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTfW6CmqJ5XzjmH3pMWU9ZF45jxzvB872b6pxoCMKYRHR", "voter": "0x38dAEa6f17E4308b0Da9647dB9ca6D84a3A7E195", "created": 1635242186, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcXhAWmkzHUbwQWVsdneKFLsg8NuKV8FfWhVipW3sG4y9", "voter": "0x9b96698cFfDB410cacE39E5187b8bC64b516Ac8a", "created": 1635241653, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma5SFejDUBPxtQneFr4gSASEQbW6tDS1CaqTh8WgWPS1B", "voter": "0x069e85D4F1010DD961897dC8C095FBB5FF297434", "created": 1635213487, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT3QZ61CBg3QNGXg6bmEQRgaendAEqPDCaqSLmXN9Hebi", "voter": "0x72eA986B93b63bc0e0d146b850003C2e6FF187aC", "created": 1635210661, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}]}
