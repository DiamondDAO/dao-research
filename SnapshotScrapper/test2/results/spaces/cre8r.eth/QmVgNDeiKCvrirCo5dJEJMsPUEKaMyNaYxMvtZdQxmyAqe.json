In my opinion this should not count for the Coordinape because it is low effort, and low quality, especially because much of the time, the watermark from the website is still visible in the corner. These kinda of things are embarrassing to showcase to clients and as we're maturing as a DAO we need to up the quality, and in the case of memes, LOLZ of our work. It is also a major waste of resources because these kinds of memes are getting some CRE8RS hundreds of dollars each epoch. \ud83d\udcb0 \u27a1 \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\uded1 WE NEED TO END THIS. \ud83d\uded1\n\nThat's why I am making this snapshot vote. We need work we are proud to showcase, not the kind of memes you find on the Telegram of a third tier rug on BSC. \n\nThat isn't to say if you have a silly meme idea and want to run it off quickly, Tweet it out, or whatever using one of these sites it shouldn't be allowed, but it should be disqualified from the coordinape.", "choices": ["No more money for these memes \ud83d\uded1", "Keep these kind of memes in  \u2705"], "start": 1630440000, "end": 1630857600, "snapshot": "13135331", "state": "closed", "author": "0x72eA986B93b63bc0e0d146b850003C2e6FF187aC", "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth", "name": "CRE8R DAO"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZVArBukCmushUYEY9cU6SKNqYZVdn7NYvxymtR5To6pa", "voter": "0x2164d6b2EF215A4f46912BdD18F27a25041EBe29", "created": 1630601048, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmepJieuis39Lqr4Qk2tjAcMLqrSXo5iut2Ep9tSPy3dG3", "voter": "0x4Ee34BA6c5707f37C8367fd8AEF43F754435F588", "created": 1630491508, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRvx1MABsQnAGDgxngc7YHvLxwhxwPmAdYP9xgvVSQoLC", "voter": "0x70a77Ab3492da757AAe4FBeE03F8a14880523Df5", "created": 1630474735, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXTvypjgAa2UPCm5aNW5NkhkgPuMcR5FqFxQ1rbGgDsbf", "voter": "0x38dAEa6f17E4308b0Da9647dB9ca6D84a3A7E195", "created": 1630472687, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVurUhwtuTRVJoRokp8C4n2fXTCriS7edhNrLvN2wfZgs", "voter": "0xEfce38f31Ebeb9637E85D3487595261FDf6ebeEb", "created": 1630472262, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRjkwYYhKX6PbzAoDwhsbrUpDwDWFt2H9521aAJEvUDsM", "voter": "0x6AB880AFd1E0C7786cc5D05F4FD9b17761768da8", "created": 1630464181, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeP2pKgeerAstSjmGcb7oyhBk18E4wDqHRnZcZbDmQmBe", "voter": "0x9b96698cFfDB410cacE39E5187b8bC64b516Ac8a", "created": 1630461029, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYXiGwR4w5Lhx6i8ag9nwanYy65rWmacBhNpnrpRAd5mi", "voter": "0x3c5Aac016EF2F178e8699D6208796A2D67557fe2", "created": 1630456628, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTzUKjQvLqdfxg161swAnSdjB38Gkq5W5wWf3MnYGHoLT", "voter": "0xCFFE08BDf20918007f8Ab268C32f8756494fC8D8", "created": 1630444929, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfM9fPqTJV2mQfGfeG6ZFndVp1pDvLZZimtNrstoZRdhs", "voter": "0xf04946c11127A096Bcd6a572c01C89C164f2fa12", "created": 1630440723, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXsx868gbTBsQ57PFXbpeA8BEBhHGgf3b4pGMnZJr4sfn", "voter": "0x72eA986B93b63bc0e0d146b850003C2e6FF187aC", "created": 1630440414, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}]}
