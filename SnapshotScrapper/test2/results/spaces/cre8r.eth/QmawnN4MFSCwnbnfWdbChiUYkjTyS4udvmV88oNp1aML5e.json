However, I think I might have found a solution to this and might be able to do it afterall. \n\nThat being said, I had some interesting conversations with people as an outcome of this. \n\nSome said, \n- we are all Degens and holding ETH is what we do.\n- the cost to send ETH (gas) is cheaper than any other ERC20\n- if stables are sent, it limits the usability. USDC-->ETH--->shitcoin\n- if ETH doesn't makes it we all NGMI\n- ETH has upside\n- we could very simply make each GIVE worth x amount of ETH (ie 0.003ETH)\n- holding USDs in the war-chest is very irresponsible as it could be yielding somewhere.\n\nOthers said\n- ETH might dump soon in USD value.\n- The bigger the pool the better.\n- USDs historically has better yield in deFi (if we were to actually deploy it)\n- trading fees between USDs are lower then tkn-ETH LPs\n- one of our former clients has a use case for USDC (BMI) whereas none of our clients have one for ETH only.", "choices": ["FOR Vitalik", "Against Vitalik"], "start": 1630123200, "end": 1630382400, "snapshot": "13107647", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3c5Aac016EF2F178e8699D6208796A2D67557fe2", "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth", "name": "CRE8R DAO"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRopCSUBMm3CESyVZ11ANrerrmYywBCrVn9YUAPSWcb6Q", "voter": "0x069e85D4F1010DD961897dC8C095FBB5FF297434", "created": 1630305433, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTzEERPCcsmULhHh1xaK2CsB8DwGcRmnsaert3JVHsxf1", "voter": "0xD8B3AffA8747b9aea0f60FF97D7797942276Fcda", "created": 1630268953, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNR11pA2cU3dxwrB8dNmgjVEFjc2u9Lh16yaq8Njdttac", "voter": "0xBc005Fa1476d6E4f582B6B067D15D4ed512536ae", "created": 1630200819, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTTM3g4QppdhMPuLdGhQ62GqQaJgcbkUYtqHCEq1aYvAb", "voter": "0x72eA986B93b63bc0e0d146b850003C2e6FF187aC", "created": 1630173173, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU2ZrTEoY4bBRgXYBHn2BBons7UNki3CZjQuDVbUtc4Zu", "voter": "0x70a77Ab3492da757AAe4FBeE03F8a14880523Df5", "created": 1630163812, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme4hbpUsor7fimWtfrEBJxnxFaj2TGQZ3vuqeuyeiRCDi", "voter": "0x38dAEa6f17E4308b0Da9647dB9ca6D84a3A7E195", "created": 1630135928, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPTyUSuLPFUBBj82RoUudxFBpggoeMEtcNLeG8UVZPrYc", "voter": "0x3c5Aac016EF2F178e8699D6208796A2D67557fe2", "created": 1630125528, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRQEU8DJHr2PDWFcWotnrFz6ucYbwfHSbCetbGiQwqMQv", "voter": "0xf04946c11127A096Bcd6a572c01C89C164f2fa12", "created": 1630123274, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}]}
