Currently these are organised into threads. \n\nThe idea of this is pretty simple. Weekly meetings cover too much stuff and there is to many open conversations in discord that are not being worked through to a conclusion. So now we can make dedicated groups that anyone can join. These groups will create proposals (for budget or otherwise) which will be voted on in snapshot if needed. \n\nThe members of these working groups should be rewarded for their effort! This proposal makes that possible.\n\nCurrent examples of active working groups (please note each one of these needs to apply for their share of the 100k budget). \n\nAlso note these groups may apply for additional budget which is outside of the 100k which is purely to reward working group members. \n\n-Token Use \n-Workflow Processes \n-Incentives for joining working groups and participating and getting the result \n-Strategy For Campaigns \n-Content Marketing For CRE8R DAO\n-Incentives program for KPI based clients\n\nWe ( @Bee926#4033 @PassiveCrypto#6857 @dunks411  ) propose  100k CRE8R Tokens to be made available for working groups. Each group will need to make their own proposals for their share of that budget.\n\nWorking groups can have their own Coordinape circles to distribute their share of the CRE8R tokens.\n\nThe proposals for share of 100k budget will need to pass certain criteria which may include:\n\n-timeline\n-specific, measurable results\n-etc\n\nThis criteria itself will be a work in progress that can be futher defined based on feedback from proposals. Founding 100 will be required to vote and give feedback the working groups proposals.  \n\nFinal note:\nThere is no timeline for the use of this 100k. Working groups can apply for as little or as much as they feel they need and the timeline and deliverables will be defined in those proposals. If all the 100k budget gets allocated then it will be up to the DAO to renew this budget or not. \n\nThis proposal just provides a basic framework and gives some permission to DAO members to apply for budget. \n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1631757600, "end": 1632016800, "snapshot": "13238400", "state": "closed", "author": "0x069e85D4F1010DD961897dC8C095FBB5FF297434", "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth", "name": "CRE8R DAO"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXMU845dXDqtx4gJ823jcCw39cPCNrchwU2PqM23hGgFK", "voter": "0x3c5Aac016EF2F178e8699D6208796A2D67557fe2", "created": 1631974107, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQf3hS4rU58UyLCkNV4WYzHZZ1kivT4g8KuvdK2UC6266", "voter": "0x72eA986B93b63bc0e0d146b850003C2e6FF187aC", "created": 1631905159, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYxRpKgCoq6GRPZMTEyXbsGtZkJW66ceGyNmdr1FhscUo", "voter": "0xf04946c11127A096Bcd6a572c01C89C164f2fa12", "created": 1631879130, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTPW8CSrAKHyMWxuVL5wkoRtbBjehm7wgZ9YJFAhbsqsG", "voter": "0x4Ee34BA6c5707f37C8367fd8AEF43F754435F588", "created": 1631835869, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmecVqYctVr8QQKaCm9t5twmCheg1Bn97cA3SZv9ASZobq", "voter": "0xBc005Fa1476d6E4f582B6B067D15D4ed512536ae", "created": 1631832441, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUeMMjp9qNarsheViseZawy8pAciHUDSCm8P2hNbsev4f", "voter": "0x38dAEa6f17E4308b0Da9647dB9ca6D84a3A7E195", "created": 1631821869, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRzgCcP6oXNAom3v15BTuePeAScpv9H5WryVNbwmNqamS", "voter": "0xEfce38f31Ebeb9637E85D3487595261FDf6ebeEb", "created": 1631817986, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbeVavvEG4UaXMZCQtJ9NXN7gDge3tQ7aYmaWZMDcD6r1", "voter": "0x069e85D4F1010DD961897dC8C095FBB5FF297434", "created": 1631817064, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}]}
