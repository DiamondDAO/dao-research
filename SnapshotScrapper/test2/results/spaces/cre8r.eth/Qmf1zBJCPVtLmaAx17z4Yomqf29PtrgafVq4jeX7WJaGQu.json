But even these ways (pfp project) will cost money as well. PFP project needs devs and artists plus a lot of design and planning. \n\nIt may take months to do the PFP project properly without it being a low quality cash grab. If we are going to do it properly we should have money in treasury to pay for what we need not asking people to do stuff for equity (isn't that the suggested reason we don't want to sell our founding 100 NFT LOL?!?!). \n\nConsider the numbers 2% (rounded it up its actually 1.75%) share of DAO for min 50ETH (doesn't count price increase per epoch).  = 50ETH. Which is 150,000USD. \n\nThis puts full valuation at $7500,000 \n\nWith price increase per epoch we may not sell these fast (that's good we want to save a lot for creators) but the people who buy them will buy them for a reason. Because they want to be part of this and they will be paying a lot of money for that privilege! \n\nWe are not just selling a 1.75% (half of 3.5% assuming half sell half earned) share of the DAO we are offering different kinds of people who are not creators a chance to join us and help us in many ways. Clients can buy these if they want to be able to vote or we can gift them to repeat clients. People who like the project and have vision and energy to help steer it in the right direction can buy these and join in our early governance as well as helping with biz dev and internal processes, knowing that they are working on something they own a share of. \n\nAlso it gives these NFT's real value NOW. They are purchasable but you as a creator can earn them WHILE getting paid for client work. It also puts an incentive to work hard and get them quick because they can get bought up. Otherwise they can just sit there for months with no urgency to earn them. \n\nPlease stick to the original design of this. We have already sold one and the guy who bought it is super cool! Maybe chat with him and find out his perspective? IMO he is already a great asset to the DAO. \n\nNo matter what we need to honour his share of the tokens when they launch.
