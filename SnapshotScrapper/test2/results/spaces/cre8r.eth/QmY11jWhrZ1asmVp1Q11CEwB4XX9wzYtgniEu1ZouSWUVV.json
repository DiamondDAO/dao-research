There are two of us working on the content but for simplicity, we\u2019re using only one account to vote. That\u2019s my account. As such bowtiednerd will need to go through this path to get voted in instead of the usual criteria way, because he won\u2019t ever have fulfilled the criteria based on his account alone. I think that\u2019s not fair for him.\n\nReasons:\n\nWe have a total of 7 epochs, getting over 6k USDC since we joined the DAO, so this is more than enough for the criteria for 2 persons to be eligible for the F100\n\nOur voting address and wallet for payment from the DAO is this: 0x46236f725FDc61DF68e6AB12D094Cf5995a15802, so feel free to verify. Most are in eth mainnet and a part of it is in polygon.\n\nI always believed in deeds, not words. I hope both of us have proven to be valuable members of the DAO through our actions, not merely in words.\n\nWould love to hear if there are anyone who opposes this? Please state why and I hope to address this.", "choices": ["LFG", "NO"], "start": 1634000400, "end": 1634173200, "snapshot": "13407131", "state": "closed", "author": "0x069e85D4F1010DD961897dC8C095FBB5FF297434", "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth", "name": "CRE8R DAO"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmW6edfNh8KR1MGcjzChDF6oiY59dqpLKTBRhiRJB8xsdX", "voter": "0x4Ee34BA6c5707f37C8367fd8AEF43F754435F588", "created": 1634155170, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTj3q3zYeP38NnQaJsvEPk8ZpZ7uLpt2qWK7fJVkeRJ2T", "voter": "0x38dAEa6f17E4308b0Da9647dB9ca6D84a3A7E195", "created": 1634109059, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "Qman2LS6RrooenjWrbZBghWN7diX1pAu3m2amuQAy1YuU9", "voter": "0x6AB880AFd1E0C7786cc5D05F4FD9b17761768da8", "created": 1634106980, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRdoptaAcprrPtWSa5G3Lveb2dHFUH2GYBaEbmwCLXsKK", "voter": "0x46236f725FDc61DF68e6AB12D094Cf5995a15802", "created": 1634095234, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP2VkPXfDj78UUXb2qkT89tMh1zRYjh5FUJhgsQs4So1i", "voter": "0xBc005Fa1476d6E4f582B6B067D15D4ed512536ae", "created": 1634091320, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRB1v7WmLg4QEs2WrZ7i6h2qS6DHatK2QL6dSgMUiX6ui", "voter": "0x72eA986B93b63bc0e0d146b850003C2e6FF187aC", "created": 1634089749, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmefJZLS91nUDMuC1B5L3cH1E38GVTuvHy8q5G8F6bBC2N", "voter": "0xf04946c11127A096Bcd6a572c01C89C164f2fa12", "created": 1634088818, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNMJiKntnUkRekQpa2odpXyYLSuYnsVEvQurFU4EyrSkj", "voter": "0x069e85D4F1010DD961897dC8C095FBB5FF297434", "created": 1634088261, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}]}
