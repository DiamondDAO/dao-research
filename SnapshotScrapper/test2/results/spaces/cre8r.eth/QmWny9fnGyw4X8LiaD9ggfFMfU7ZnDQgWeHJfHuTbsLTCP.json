{"id": "QmWny9fnGyw4X8LiaD9ggfFMfU7ZnDQgWeHJfHuTbsLTCP", "title": " Token Initial Distribution", "body": "\n**SUMMARY**\n\nThis is a proposal to distribute some CRE8R tokens.\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\n* Some Cre8rs are concerned about the tax implications of distributing tokens post assignment of value.\n\n* Some Cre8rs have done a lot of admin, and marketing, work that has gone unrewarded.\n\n* In order to get whitelisted for Bancor LPs, we need to have the token distributed somewhat. So I would like to propose some. \n*(This proposal is not agreeing to use bancor as our LP,  just to get the option to do so)*\n\n\n**SPECIFICATION**\n\nThe $CRE8R token has a max supply of 88,888,888\n\nThe proposal is to allocate 8,888,888 tokens (10% of the MSup) for immediate and later distributions.\n\n* 25% of the 8,888,888 to the Multisig.\n\nThey have been here since the start.\nThey have done many things to take us where we are today.\n{insert your validations, or conflict below}\nIf this is to pass, that would be 2,222,222 tokens or 370,370 (rounded) each\n\n* 70% of the 8,888,888 to the F100 NFT holders\n\nThey have earned their place in the DAO\nThey will continue to partake in further projects\nWe won\u2019t need to add CRE8R tokens to individual Circles\n{insert your validations, or conflict below}\nIf this is to pass, that would be 6,222,222 tokens or 62,222 (rounded) each - Many of these will remain in the treasury until all F100 NFT have been given and earners that become eligible after the value is assigned via an LP will be streamed via sablier\n\n* 5% to the people that have been active in the discord channel proportional to their activity. Dunks can explain this better than me. \n\nThese people are also the dao, and they deserve compensation. We COULD consider this also a way to recruit more to the discord, but I worry about this.\nIf this is to pass, that would be 444,444 tokens or assuming 620 members 717 (rounded) each\n*Dunks has a tool to grade people in the discord based on their contribution so although it the total is divided by the members, they will not all receive equal shares.*\n\nFor the discussion: \n\nhttps://discourse.cre8r.vip/t/cre8r-distribution-proposal/36", "choices": ["GIB dem CRE8Rs", "GIB no-one"], "start": 1633838400, "end": 1634356800, "snapshot": "13391425", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3c5Aac016EF2F178e8699D6208796A2D67557fe2", "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth", "name": "CRE8R DAO"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNYHw54SusVeaLqHqntYxywMWGNupeKMXnXAw2y9b3MfX", "voter": "0x9b96698cFfDB410cacE39E5187b8bC64b516Ac8a", "created": 1634219039, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWwEjRkduL2adCJDMt4bY3TxcxebFrLarrUcHzD5GRdwu", "voter": "0x70a77Ab3492da757AAe4FBeE03F8a14880523Df5", "created": 1634126850, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ6uZA3TgZZK6WmsLTvGyKwcQQGoypPHthpRqef26m2mT", "voter": "0x38dAEa6f17E4308b0Da9647dB9ca6D84a3A7E195", "created": 1634109143, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR8dwNYrGhDGp71BqH5E38yQJ9zVf3K54KJ9qiyo5gVDn", "voter": "0x6AB880AFd1E0C7786cc5D05F4FD9b17761768da8", "created": 1634107071, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTCdHwTjqdesjpFdX1GTMLzq4ToNRa8NJWAFSKYoRx9e7", "voter": "0x72eA986B93b63bc0e0d146b850003C2e6FF187aC", "created": 1634089795, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmcdy9UZ7JARHVaaMzbj1BhPoJNzcun78mN7UYHDtMscTZ", "voter": "0x46236f725FDc61DF68e6AB12D094Cf5995a15802", "created": 1634051353, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZN7VVgLFLKWgNvhFiteDCYJB8wCPAxok6RpY7r5Y4C6K", "voter": "0xEfce38f31Ebeb9637E85D3487595261FDf6ebeEb", "created": 1633976411, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU16Q7736E6NBqPpvUNcd2o9P4uU1RqR96jbXPLuocqqP", "voter": "0x069e85D4F1010DD961897dC8C095FBB5FF297434", "created": 1633904578, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdBC6NCazHPJPiNAVp5ukK8JLD5VvJQEzAYztCJSVScMZ", "voter": "0xf04946c11127A096Bcd6a572c01C89C164f2fa12", "created": 1633892594, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVJ2wSk8QhwnXbTERu9Eoa38Si6B9zrX1vzQGPkHkFcmo", "voter": "0x4Ee34BA6c5707f37C8367fd8AEF43F754435F588", "created": 1633881899, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVdSzJfE7WaF9TcyLUqAfg99Dih4LuVUTfNzHmujEi2h1", "voter": "0x3c5Aac016EF2F178e8699D6208796A2D67557fe2", "created": 1633880839, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSQ6bZmnigm6Qeb7MBgv9u6r7mRzuVBnttaxzGxDnD4bK", "voter": "0xBc005Fa1476d6E4f582B6B067D15D4ed512536ae", "created": 1633878380, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}]}
