Then this proposal is invalidated!!\n", "choices": ["Hodl the ETH. no \ud83c\udf44", "Vault the ETH", "Vault and farm \ud83c\udf44"], "start": 1634974200, "end": 1635220800, "snapshot": "13472379", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3c5Aac016EF2F178e8699D6208796A2D67557fe2", "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth", "name": "CRE8R DAO"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWeNWnriGPuS4944G3pbMdKuyT9z8VxGwevNqQenqDTLm", "voter": "0x3c5Aac016EF2F178e8699D6208796A2D67557fe2", "created": 1635084964, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTfL878wVmWX7XGo9HnRgnmDcXZnnWiN3ioqJynp2RrJr", "voter": "0x69C2dab0B7add3C71310f3791F02bFc0BfD240ae", "created": 1635044565, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTT4A7RDXfKp2P3uqenDZBEDYZC9Zhdc8qA2CLPVVVj95", "voter": "0x46236f725FDc61DF68e6AB12D094Cf5995a15802", "created": 1635044153, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQfHAMorHURb9anKfZuztbX1EcYeSDZopgFtEPgsNG2LV", "voter": "0xEfce38f31Ebeb9637E85D3487595261FDf6ebeEb", "created": 1634992431, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVsTB94q1kZwpc35EngKUyEFoC6ZbBVPMEZVJiqWRShCM", "voter": "0x72eA986B93b63bc0e0d146b850003C2e6FF187aC", "created": 1634986507, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmavyM2Xhp2ZUF58XYRTnZYCpoCwdZcFkZsdsG7PTnq6F5", "voter": "0x6AB880AFd1E0C7786cc5D05F4FD9b17761768da8", "created": 1634984600, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVaAQFcPwfaRaMgJSzVFQjHyncMTiKKtjDrfFGYfQ5VGd", "voter": "0x38dAEa6f17E4308b0Da9647dB9ca6D84a3A7E195", "created": 1634975436, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cre8r.eth"}}]}
