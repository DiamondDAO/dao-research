Due to the Ethereum miner fee, it is difficult for small trades to generate a net contribution. Thus many users who only make small trades cannot obtain LON.\n\nGoal\n* Allow users who trade in small amounts to obtain LON, thereby enjoying fee discounts by holding LON, and gaining the right to participate in community governance.\n\nProposed Action Items\n* Add rule: A trader will receive a base LON mining power for every trade, base power = gas fee in USD * 0.1\n  * Example: If you make a trade and paid $2 in USD for gas fee, you will receive 0.2 base power for LON mining.\n* Implement it to take effect in the second phase of LON mining.\n\n----------\n\n\u80cc\u666f\n* \u6839\u636e\u76ee\u524d\u7684 LON \u6316\u77ff\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u9700\u4ea7\u751f\u51c0\u8d21\u732e\u624d\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97 LON\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u77ff\u5de5\u8d39\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c0f\u989d\u4ea4\u6613\u7528\u6237\u8f83\u96be\u4ea7\u751f\u51c0\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97 LON\u3002\n\n\u76ee\u7684\n* \u4f7f\u5c0f\u989d\u4ea4\u6613\u7528\u6237\u4e5f\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97 LON\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u6709 LON \u4eab\u53d7\u8d39\u7387\u6298\u6263\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u53c2\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u6743\u5229\u3002\n\n\u63d0\u6848\u6267\u884c\u9879\n* \u6dfb\u52a0\u89c4\u5219\uff1a\u5728 Tokenlon \u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u6613\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u57fa\u7840\u7b97\u529b\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u7b97\u529b = \u4ea4\u6613\u77ff\u5de5\u8d39\uff08\u4ee5\u7f8e\u5143\u8ba1\uff09* 0.1\n  * \u4f8b\u5982\uff1a\u4f60\u505a\u4e86\u4e00\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u4ed8\u4e86 2 \u7f8e\u5143\u77ff\u5de5\u8d39 \uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u4f60\u5c06\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97 0.2 \u57fa\u7840\u7b97\u529b\n* \u5728 LON \u6316\u77ff\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u751f\u6548", "choices": ["For (\u652f\u6301)", "Against (\u53cd\u5bf9)"], "start": 1603854000, "end": 1604030400, "snapshot": "11142788", "state": "closed", "author": "0x25A087dC3512e3BE548F0cA13233ae29d3781bdC", "space": {"id": "tokenlon.eth", "name": "Tokenlon"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
