The settlement cycle is long, so it takes a long time for miners to know the exact LON allocation result.\n\nGoal\n* Shorten the mining settlement cycle so that miners can obtain LON allocation results faster.\n\nProposed Action Items\n* Change the LON mining settlement cycle from once a week to once a day, and the settlement time to 0:00 UTC every day. It will take effect in the second phase of LON mining.\n\n----------\n\n\u80cc\u666f\n* \u76ee\u524d LON \u6316\u77ff\u7ed3\u7b97\u5468\u671f\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5468\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u7ed3\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5468\u516d 0:00 UTC \u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u7ed3\u7b97\u5468\u671f\u8f83\u957f\uff0c\u6316\u77ff\u7528\u6237\u9700\u8981\u8f83\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u624d\u80fd\u77e5\u9053\u786e\u5207\u7684 LON \u5206\u914d\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\n\n\u76ee\u7684\n* \u7f29\u77ed\u6316\u77ff\u7ed3\u7b97\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u8ba9\u6316\u77ff\u7528\u6237\u8f83\u5feb\u5c31\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97 LON \u5206\u914d\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\n\n\u63d0\u6848\u6267\u884c\u9879\n* \u5c06 LON \u6316\u77ff\u7ed3\u7b97\u5468\u671f\u7531\u6bcf\u5468\u4e00\u6b21\u4fee\u6539\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5929\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u7ed3\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5929 0:00 UTC\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 LON \u6316\u77ff\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u751f\u6548\u3002", "choices": ["For (\u652f\u6301)", "Against (\u53cd\u5bf9)"], "start": 1603854000, "end": 1604030400, "snapshot": "11142580", "state": "closed", "author": "0x25A087dC3512e3BE548F0cA13233ae29d3781bdC", "space": {"id": "tokenlon.eth", "name": "Tokenlon"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
