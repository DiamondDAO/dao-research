Some community members reported that the settlement cycle is too short, which resulted in a significant impact on power-to-LON ratio by the total volume of the day.\n\nGoal\n* Let community members vote to decide the mining settlement cycle again.\n\nProposed Action Items\n* Make changes based on the voting results of the proposal (if necessary), and take effect at 0:00 UTC on November 7, 2020.\n\nVoting Options\n* A. No change, keep the settlement cycle once a day. The settlement time is * 0:00 UTC every day.\n* B. Make a change, modify the settlement cycle to once a week. The settlement time is 0:00 UTC every Saturday.\n* C. Make a change, modify the settlement cycle to once only. The settlement time is 0:00 UTC on December 20, 2020, the end of the second phase.\n\n---\n\n\u80cc\u666f\n* \u76ee\u524d\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5 LON \u6316\u77ff\u7ed3\u7b97\u5468\u671f\u4e3a\u6bcf\u65e5\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u7ed3\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a\u6bcf\u65e5 0:00 UTC \u65f6\u95f4\u3002\n* \u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u505a\u5e02\u5546\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0cLON \u65e5\u5206\u53d1\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\u4e3a20\u4e07\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u793e\u533a\u6210\u5458\u53cd\u9988\u7ed3\u7b97\u5468\u671f\u8f83\u77ed\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f53\u65e5\u603b\u4ea4\u6613\u91cf\u5bf9\u7b97\u529b\u4e0e LON \u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u6bd4\u503c\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5927\u3002\n\n\u76ee\u7684\n* \u8ba9\u793e\u533a\u6210\u5458\u518d\u6b21\u6295\u7968\u51b3\u7b56\u6316\u77ff\u7ed3\u7b97\u5468\u671f\u3002\n\n\u63d0\u6848\u6267\u884c\u9879\n* \u6839\u636e\u63d0\u6848\u6295\u7968\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u51fa\u4fee\u6539\uff08\u5982\u9700\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a 2020 \u5e74 11 \u6708 7 \u65e5 0:00 UTC\n\n\u6295\u7968\u9009\u9879\n* A. \u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u7b97\u5468\u671f\u6bcf\u5929\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u7ed3\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5929 0:00 UTC\n* B. \u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u7ed3\u7b97\u5468\u671f\u4fee\u6539\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5468\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u7ed3\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5468\u516d 0:00 UTC\n* C. \u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u7ed3\u7b97\u5468\u671f\u4fee\u6539\u4e3a\u4ec5\u6709\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u7ed3\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a 2020 \u5e74 12 \u6708 20 \u65e5 0:00 UTC\uff0c\u5373\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u6316\u77ff\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6", "choices": ["A.
