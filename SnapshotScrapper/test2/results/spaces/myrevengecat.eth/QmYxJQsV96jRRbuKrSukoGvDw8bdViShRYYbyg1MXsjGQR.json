It was the morning in the US and I awoke to some terrible news. Our beloved boy died of boredom.\n\nPart of me is so proud of everyone for our three week run, collectively caring for this amazing cat and being a part of something incredible.\n\nI want to apologize that I did not follow my routine check ins and let this slide; I've been trying to keep him topped up with dev funds to ease the transition to a rewarding future where profit will be abundant.\n\nWhen speaking with the community, I found that large LOVE holders were concerned that they were carrying the game - forced to spend to keep it going.\n\nI also found that other, smaller caretakers with JUST AS MUCH passion for Carl and this wonderful community felt very bad that they couldn't give more.\n\nWith that said, I propose the following:\n\nWe use the owner's ability to revive Carl.\n\nWe implement a new smart contract called EmergencyLove. This contract will hold BNB funded by the dev, and allow anyone to interact with Carl only paying the gas fee. Carl's attribute must be below 11 to call the functions.\n\nThis contract will ease the concerns for caretakers that feel strapped for cash, but love Carl all the same.\n\nThis contract will also take the LOVE gained from these interactions and BURN it, reducing LOVE supply, helping LOVE appreciate in value, which is great for our more generous caretakers.\n\nThe lesson we all learned today is that Carl's life really is in the hands of the community. That's why I feel that this solution best solves the problem and makes the game more fun and interesting for all players, without changing any core mechanics.\n\nPlease consider this and vote with your LOVE on if this should be implemented.\n\nThanks you so much for enjoying the game and loving this silly Cat.", "choices": ["Yes, Revive Carl and Implement", "No, let's do something else"], "start": 1633903200, "end": 1633989600, "snapshot": "11662930", "state": "closed", "author": "0x408ECB06EF97705Afb02646ae1E5537F370a6bfB", "space": {"id": "myrevengecat.eth", "name": "My Revenge Cat"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNTJQ1BEBnZdxTZ43kHNx8uRAoVpRE55VchfGU2oH5VCw", "voter": "0xaC81228C2F025df0df4ed6468479AC066079dc8c", "created": 1633928915, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myrevengecat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTYx2vScZ6W1kmgp96XQxxZDjRXnre6xH75jrR4Lq4p31", "voter": "0x73366664A7AfbDC6ab63AE3CB4A4f552be9F95ce", "created": 1633928728, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myrevengecat.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbv3gH79AHA1b1YWGhQTZcQo4PwvkpEqLHRmhfTjbHahg", "voter": "0xC986B1Aa3bFD11069e1e1bC67C712895Bc5DbC40", "created": 1633928409, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myrevengecat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbnCiqsj9kW9dWiTrZ1Gb4nmT2QnDwSfTHjuXtqeiSYAm", "voter": "0x4D0faA0bb56DdC9989DcB64a4fE5Ab0c2D6d7cf6", "created": 1633928361, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myrevengecat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQBZzSECaL8vki6qmGesYcZdmWt7Hqd2hMgnRWs7JjGmc", "voter": "0x33F7B2E8762990F350C549BA0C8322BEB8Dd0a65", "created": 1633926696, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myrevengecat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWwTjmzCiK9Laos9GwoN2QtJ3CtocWkiaSXbTWXtj5dYq", "voter": "0xFB7D32916BbBed4cdD73e38814d239C83BfB3b97", "created": 1633925947, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myrevengecat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV42mvx3d9HsnYCbgMFs5UcDLh61Jin8xUdesJkUToGDp", "voter": "0x0b74A6F930abC0cdE6C1c6231392aFC59a27F219", "created": 1633925240, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myrevengecat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT2VC1jBLX3RM2hsZbwZARq29GM1Zu4mCkC7fMsDDYmZv", "voter": "0x3bc13761c860B6c3AE50E17A3691CDC99762B4E4", "created": 1633912743, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "myrevengecat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcpnETAVqgpqwBgK3MrAmMzvXti7FBMPRSozupG3X6tTq", "voter": "0xC51283E6A879744b272BaeCdAe1036799352Dfe9", "created": 1633906796, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myrevengecat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVG1ZUpAyz6knov7sJ29zfs77k11PqK4A9FHYEt9BRzK9", "voter": "0xE589570F38c319e557bD1360f6be52F0d59d6685", "created": 1633905578, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myrevengecat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcEktdV7GQkwWDr7fP43uGUe6a3qj4BmSK32LzbUuTUpZ", "voter": "0x1125a9f95f2338F53D91278bA313194C6cBF2BeC", "created": 1633905349, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myrevengecat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQADzNirSksq5z18RfwMqgJB7KjnxYJegAeUMnuGCVabC", "voter": "0x46a2E3b18c5264074e3b6b63ECbC41Be4e731351", "created": 1633905191, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myrevengecat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZgrAvVfiRedfpvVz3wFsENepdesJUrb29d9p4pteA9Lf", "voter": "0x751eD896c6F48F9768603f96650f80E319922012", "created": 1633904887, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "myrevengecat.eth"}}]}
