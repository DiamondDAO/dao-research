No other project offers DCA into indices\n- It will create synergy between our communities. Indexed is supported by Molly Wintermute and promoted by Redphone Crypto, so would add their weight to our supporter-base\n- This opens the door to future collaboration with Indexed in both directions, and furthers our reputation as innovators in the new wave of Defi\n\nThis vote is meant to be a pre-vote.\nIt allows the concerned parties to make preparations for an implementation which will then be voted on onchain once it's ready.\n\n\nNow it's up to you. Yes? or No?\nThe voting period is 48h (snapshot hours are confusing so forgive me if it's slightly more or less)\n\n", "choices": ["Yes, make it happen", "No,  because reasons"], "start": 1620900000, "end": 1620986400, "snapshot": "12427824", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7165ac4008c3603AfE432787419eB61B3a2CEe8B", "space": {"id": "inversefinance.eth", "name": "Inverse Finance"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTJpXDMBf6ieokrEDyL5ccWVzBGWfk7QDZtRJSp7eEk1x", "voter": "0xB9b93bF2DB3678b010E71Ef701d763Aee144E93E", "created": 1620983350, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "inversefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcR7UmMBBnQt5py9kjzSybRkxUADXk3H1E9EpKyU4sRzD", "voter": "0x2E96dBe6709b412D9A496f2b35854790cC8552Ae", "created": 1620981976, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "inversefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR9mP3oMWhFKxz6ES1f4mz2AvzckaAUN59fJonJ76Ybtw", "voter": "0xDcdB53E8E1123BAA64a0B7d3Da13E360CA843797", "created": 1620974950, "choice": {"1": 1}, "space": {"id": "inversefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPouVuPHbEbEVZct7tmg2hoah1mTMubEiT7BQ4WY2Sb57", "voter": "0xDb5564b59ACF4A8Ff72E717394dB60fa58D9bBAc", "created": 1620972973, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "inversefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXi8v4P8oUfyvD3zQgLAQyphkWRSrFc6rrpa8P3CaUKTB", "voter": "0xc0060A35dD60E6f03C1257adf496591a392E79a4", "created": 1620970021, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "inversefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfR9dXPUXuCCcz3szBpyc4e2mMZiM9gUGdaMX1s15b31e", "voter": "0x5aec3d8d78b59c99Dbb5950015825aa633BCBD23", "created": 1620957602, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "inversefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP81eCPA2ThivgcdWZoFMhKntbMLzFpebYXaeGq89BZDj", "voter": "0x720E5D6f26A2780c0015580CAcCD28FE1E3D89cF", "created": 1620956948, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "inversefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTNSBgJkbeZhdpY7kouvaTMN53GrakDueuhXmHmcRNTpL", "voter": "0x5B33FA22DBc17a6c3Fb6cb550C3775C1ceaF57A0", "created": 1620954704, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "inversefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWszvEqtkRi3VmKLmjmXaCrtHjRkeaZPv1BH3KbuztBUz", "voter": "0xBD1f7d88C76A86C60d41bDDD4819fAe404e7151E", "created": 1620947268, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "inversefinance.eth"}}]}
