{"id": "QmVWis3rH8XwjgrbrNehhPkqnNNahDE18H133gSkhwBZju", "title": "[Proposal] Use still vested and locked PERL tokens (PERL) to mint synthetic assets", "body": "Summary\n=========\nTo use still vested and locked PERL tokens (PERL) to mint pxUSD and other synthetic assets (pxAssets).\n\nAbstract\n======\nThere are currently nearly 40% of PERL tokens held for Team, Treasury, Early Adopters and Seed token holders that are locked up until the agreed timing according to the token vesting schedule in this proposal, I will call these PERL Tokens a \u201cVested Token\u201d or \u201cVested PERLs\u201d. These tokens should be permitted to be used by Perlin to mint pxAssets to enable adequate liquidity and I propose that they not be able to be actively traded in the market until the appropriate token vesting schedule date as agreed. \n\nUnderstanding that PERL is not an inflationary token, Perlin\u2019s treasury is unable to pay out lucrative rewards compared to projects with inflationary tokenomics. This proposal is a way to bootstrap liquidity without dilution to token holders. This allows early supporters of Perlin to participate in the program and in the growth of the ecosystem while strictly continuing to adhere to the vesting terms.\n\nMotivation\n======\nUsing the Vested PERL will allow the project to quickly add significant liquidity to PerlinX. The benefit to the Perlin token holders and community is that there will be extra liquidity and more PERL Tokens to be bought back under the buyback programme.\n\nSpecifications\n======\nAllow Vested PERL to be used by Perlin for the sole purpose of minting and providing liquidity for pxUSD and pxAssets. If requested by the original Vested PERL token holder, the Vested PERL tokens can be removed from this role and distributed to the token holder but only in strict adherence to the predetermined token release schedule.\n\n* 40% shall be returned to the existing holders of Vested Tokens;\n* 40% shall be used to fund the next buyback under the Programme; and\n* 20% shall be used to fund the operation and expansion of the Interface and the Perlin Ecosystem.\n", "choices": ["Approve", "Reject"], "start": 1615197600, "end": 1615370400, "snapshot": "11997050", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7FB992F62eA8AC1f0efBd1e2cd8555E74b92723a", "space": {"id": "perlinx.eth", "name": "PerlinX"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPpXHsZJ78f5JDi6vKCKpDBQgqJ2PkCsz672i5Kbx3oWK", "voter": "0x5cC7148770472b0B79bCB4De5857Ca38F8f71d88", "created": 1615353856, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "perlinx.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfRxD1hKrpwU8GLUPckfcbqHzhakGVCzUXhizgjfrFhPT", "voter": "0xE2e3c755b4c963E38Adcf1Aa3Af31d247787aEeD", "created": 1615301243, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "perlinx.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVnLhaTCRzE4YFHYHw2rSgCmArSV9WUCjmYUEgfgckDx5", "voter": "0x9D6Ff74ebfd95C32912167Eda0A4396a88c7b5e1", "created": 1615283188, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "perlinx.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR23XjYZbiaGuzxpzLqVPEGETeyh4RJ4h4e3AuAfG1z5Q", "voter": "0x381B4b6F8a2375A8f1F6D9f55EE3A876c974eA1A", "created": 1615201685, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "perlinx.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXunAZ7tGQvTwGQ6Pg9v1abxJJjmDjkW4fg5jkWZqKpBi", "voter": "0x9060108572dc39886F80d83B3aebbDd77cBF342E", "created": 1615201658, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "perlinx.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSqrNLveHEDc674vh5SkfS9yvfMd4tcWcCndkZdXfvBZU", "voter": "0x7FB992F62eA8AC1f0efBd1e2cd8555E74b92723a", "created": 1615200005, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "perlinx.eth"}}]}
