Those of us who have been loyal liquidity providers have been dealing with reduced reward value and impermanent loss of 60+%. The current returns are not attractive to new stakers either. \n\nAs a way to drum up some more interest and reward the believers. I thought it may make sense to increase the rewards through a reduction in Epoch 2  duration.\n\nThe vote is to:\n\n1. Reduce Epoch 2 timeline by 1/3 from ~66 to ~44 days.\n2. Reduce Epoch 2 timeline by 1/2 from ~66 to ~33 days.\n3. Keep Epoch 2 timeline the same at ~66 days.\n\nI have reviewed the medium article and looked at the code and this is noted as something that can be changed through governance.
