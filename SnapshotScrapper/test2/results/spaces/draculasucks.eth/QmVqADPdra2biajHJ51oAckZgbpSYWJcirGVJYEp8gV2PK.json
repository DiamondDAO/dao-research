The problem is the additional minting makes staking your LP tokens more attractive as to provide higher rates to farmers. \nUltimately we want a deflationary and limited supply DRC token as this encourages holding and increased value. \nThe happy medium between these 2 goals should be the following -: \n\nHard cap on total circ supply : 10 mill (the dev/treasury wallet should be included in this figure) \n\nAs the protocol starts to hit this ceiling essentially the rate of minting slows down to the rate of deflation burning. Keeping the total supply at 10 mill. \n\nBut the rate of minting still has a cap on its highest emission rate so in theory WHEN enough tvl exists in the project deflation will out weigh the minting inflation rate and drive the circ supply down from 10mill. \n\nThis seems to be a happy medium approach to these 2 goals and what the community should be looking for on a votes of this issue.", "choices": ["Agree", "Disagree"], "start": 1605038700, "end": 1605661200, "snapshot": "11231799", "state": "closed", "author": "0x82f0Ec97272571c44fCF84F2A97f360380Ead161", "space": {"id": "draculasucks.eth", "name": "Dracula Protocol"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmeqYob4src4578wwSms6uYKrnF13Wo7hWzMTEsxMPRZHM", "voter": "0x7Fb7e28B8bbbA6A0C28c8Ac6a522C2FEFe44ee96", "created": 1605370034, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "draculasucks.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS3Rj4dNeGcuPERmpL6JKZvx8LUYQZVYufKmdyMtYzVf9", "voter": "0xe5df77b5c1C541cDA961bAFBdaB2b9FB94831f98", "created": 1605254579, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "draculasucks.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUo2D4WwNhFsGUNC9FWELhC6gY8AKHcXqB3kt8M4vtfND", "voter": "0x1c70D3a0A945a5146cB852C47C9f93cA0b59aFb1", "created": 1605217075, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "draculasucks.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYZdtRzzvs87Re1Hg1NdqSekTRPNnkgRpWhewx9FXVRP4", "voter": "0xe4D7bA519F9CABfD53d26e6b6dd2A1247f6636e4", "created": 1605107978, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "draculasucks.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbse9WZJ72A4NPiGrxByqvMqSU4grkrrEmYhQPtXDQNqA", "voter": "0xf5E705F1b801785b278beb3679D6d6eeC1879e9c", "created": 1605068632, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "draculasucks.eth"}}]}
