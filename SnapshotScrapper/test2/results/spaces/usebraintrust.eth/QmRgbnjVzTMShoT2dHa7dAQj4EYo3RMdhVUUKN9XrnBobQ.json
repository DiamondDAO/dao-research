{"id": "QmRgbnjVzTMShoT2dHa7dAQj4EYo3RMdhVUUKN9XrnBobQ", "title": "[Temperature Check] Changing the fee payment model for Braintrust", "body": "Current state:\n-Currently nodes on the Braintrust network charge clients a 10% success fee on every invoice and that fee is paid in USD and flows to the node that brought the business to the network.\n-Referral fees for the parties that referred talent and clients currently come from the network\u2019s treasury and thus when they are paid, deplete the existing treasury, eventually completely exhausting it.\n\nProposals:\n-Create a new requirement that all fees on the network, including the current client success fee but also any other fees that may be initiated in the future, must be paid in BTRST.\n-Nodes will convert client fees collected in USD into USDC to send to the new Fee Converter smart contract\n-The new Fee Converter smart contract will purchase BTRST tokens with the USDC on a decentralized exchange\n-The newly purchased BTRST tokens will go to Braintrust\u2019s on-chain treasury (Governor Alpha) to be used for community development grants and to pay referral fees\n-The node that submits the USDC to the Fee Converter smart contract will receive a bonus at the end of the year from Treasury equal to some % of the USDC they contributed.  The exact % can be voted on by the community later.  This incentivizes participation in the program by nodes.\n\nNet Effect:\n-The effect on monetary supply of BTRST will be 2-fold:\n1. The demand for BTRST will be programmatically linked to the GSV of the network as 10% of all GSV will be used to purchase BTRST\n2. Referral rewards and grants, paid in BTRST, will no longer come from existing treasury but will come from actual client fees.  This way the treasury will not become exhausted by paying referral fees and grants.\n\nImplementation phases:\nPhase 1: testing\n-Execute the USDC/BTRST swap using on-chain governance via Governor Alpha\n-This proposal includes a request to purchase $10,000 USDC worth of BTRST as an initial test\n\nPhase 2: automatic conversion via new Fee Converter smart contract\n-A new smart contract (\u201cFee Converter\u201d) will be written to execute these trades at Uniswap when new USDC is deposited\n-The scripts from Phase 1 should be re-used\n-Newly purchased BTRST is sent to Governor Alpha on-chain treasury\n-Construction and security audits for the new fee converter will be grants from treasury to a community developer.\n\nFee Converter Smart Contract features:\n-Initially interact with Uniswap, other DEXes later\n-Nodes should look at liquidity and market conditions before sending USDC so please provide instructions / guidelines for doing this\n-Need instructions for when trades fail / high slippage\n", "choices": ["Aye", "Nay"], "start": 1634166000, "end": 1634338800, "snapshot": "13412533", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5318E5b4321f0c9d866F65b571a4b4fEC2689617", "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth", "name": "Braintrust"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSH2xPDgMJptRJX7wSGaDS9iDR87ERYqBpSwXvsobE9mY", "voter": "0x7e8370b2180101D6DaC8896973Bfb1cE2145E66e", "created": 1634331772, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRD9u76rDhzSMbWSXxc4Lhd5PCSPiBZZT7ctjd5J98N7v", "voter": "0x55DC546a8b2D06f39f811602A4fD074579bF940D", "created": 1634253039, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeZQCTGdGgTnuoycAJXFWMsaZmY87zbyr6M26bZ5WPRsQ", "voter": "0xC33aa71c518F1D4430fd2CBeaCd402315b3dCbF2", "created": 1634253002, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRQpTe393DzJ81hsxGsZjrwKJZQp7smb29NxnZwSrYxKS", "voter": "0xA0F8FaeD3ed20D4C8E6B422EdFD0A07C69fF9711", "created": 1634232555, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZoobf9qAwCB6jAhh8UZPhJq2tVWwXtz3Uvut94sbJg8E", "voter": "0xC6eD63963db7489a0633ef9351cE556fB018CEcE", "created": 1634182277, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQbbf5RwQCX5z1VZVhbhhDbJRiJ2cJHqmMoHixu6Y1YUH", "voter": "0x363b39d15CC9A10438F26Fba51D41bC78cEB7fC4", "created": 1634176886, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZjeRW5Z8Rfur5E1JdaCDXp6vbLSoFT85nMCBy9eXeuP1", "voter": "0x5318E5b4321f0c9d866F65b571a4b4fEC2689617", "created": 1634168818, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS36XWnmNXNovQps2Uu5eu6aWFnbr3bF9GwPS7z5zQMY4", "voter": "0xdd892d0c8448fE759D2b19b8cbc15793596Cc749", "created": 1634166380, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}]}
