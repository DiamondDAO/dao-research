Usually, that location is the US, however, there have been other restrictions as well, in which a job will require the candidate to be in one of a few select countries (usually, English speaking ones).\n\nConsidering that Braintrust employs a global work-force, and that we test extensively for English language capabilities, these restrictions are sometimes unnecessary and appear to be non-inclusive to many people on the network.\n\nSome of the companies have legitimate reasons to require certain locations for their candidates, for example, if they require a security clearance, however, most other reasons (administrative, time-zone, language etc.) are not always valid reasons and we need to educate our clients about the possibility and benefits of hiring talent abroad.\n\nPROBLEM:\n\nAt Braintrust, our goal is to create a global freelancing platform and we want to create an environment that is as inclusive as possible to everyone. Currently, a large number of companies on the platform are going against the grain by being overly selective on location, for reasons that could potentially be unnecessary.\n\nResolving this would require multiple changes/proposals in the future, but the first step we need to do is improve transparency and start educating our clients better about this issue.\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n1- Require employers to justify their reason for restricting candidates to a location\n\n2- Require our talent-matching specialists to discuss location restrictions with the employers, in an attempt to educate them and possibly get them to loosen their requirements.\n\nEXECUTION:\n\n1- Upon creating a job, employers wishing to restrict to a certain location will be required to choose the reason from a drop-down. The options in the drop-down will be:\n\nA) Security clearance required\nB) Time-zone\nC) Language\nD) Culture\nE) Economic/Administrative\nF) Other\n\nPractically speaking, we\u2019d have 1 free-form text input that lets them enter the location they are restricting to, a drop-down listed in 1- above, and another free-form text text input in which they must elaborate on the reason for the restriction; ex: \u201cOur HR policy doesn\u2019t allow us to hire abroad\u201d. The last input would have a minimum character restriction of 20.\n\n2- Our talent-matching team should gain the reflex to educate clients on our platform and how we aim to be a global workforce. Assuming they want to restrict to a location, we should discuss with them and see if their restriction could be waived. Some examples of arguments:\n \nB) Time-zone \u2013 We have workers abroad who have chosen to work US hours for the past 5 years, why not let them if it doesn\u2019t bother them?\nC) Language \u2013 All our talent has been vetted extensively for English proficiency\nD) Culture \u2013 If you\u2019re looking for talent with a similar culture, why not consider expats working abroad?\nE) Economic/Administrative \u2013 Did you know there are financial benefits to hiring contractors over w2 employees? They are considered an expense, and you don\u2019t need to pay for health insurance...etc\u2026.\n\n\nVOTE:\n    \u2022 Vote WITH if you would like customers to be required to justify their location requirements and would like the talent-matching team to educate clients better on the subject.\n    \u2022 Vote AGAINST if you want to keep things as they are currently.\n", "choices": ["WITH", "AGAINST"], "start": 1634223600, "end": 1634922000, "snapshot": "13416969", "state": "closed", "author": "0x363b39d15CC9A10438F26Fba51D41bC78cEB7fC4", "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth", "name": "Braintrust"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWgKyCbsDASgR7qH5ztdWQb42rfenpo6nQremqietejFA", "voter": "0xe9c1b1ED748eC205561e5218B437F905426A6611", "created": 1634557830, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNpgE7fZ6L3FXi7XzhEVVQeNBsAc7GYkT7ZPE66BYyWmt", "voter": "0xC6eD63963db7489a0633ef9351cE556fB018CEcE", "created": 1634411058, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSnetyFrf6o5FoWQonyYjBV9fkYRwUGaj7DaMyKe1Pqat", "voter": "0xA0F8FaeD3ed20D4C8E6B422EdFD0A07C69fF9711", "created": 1634232624, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfDG9Et2QgS4KRj53FFhY83oxjo23BJ4Gw9fBSoUZXfkT", "voter": "0xC33aa71c518F1D4430fd2CBeaCd402315b3dCbF2", "created": 1634231254, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf4hMMGtpHHk5aWoWw4c6VRH9aTM6kExaD2Zq5sYqeoov", "voter": "0x55DC546a8b2D06f39f811602A4fD074579bF940D", "created": 1634231216, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfAaVTGAAXo7Sbnxeu2kuyxXwLf2EH4iE6Vt7zM8Yr5tB", "voter": "0x03519a55Ada87109F5F678B887E8d5A5833525F9", "created": 1634226369, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWpy6gjjDtVHBJ4QHuB2quVyWzKhDCASbd4qrBCipmkAg", "voter": "0x363b39d15CC9A10438F26Fba51D41bC78cEB7fC4", "created": 1634223764, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}]}
