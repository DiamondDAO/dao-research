{"id": "QmRP7AnJhwCZKb1Mqt9HV9QNopNmshafwxFhCx4SXoKKuQ", "title": "[Temperature Check] Should Braintrust implement token staking?", "body": "**CONTEXT:**\nToken Staking is the concept that Braintrust token holders could stake their BTRST tokens to indicate urgency and interest for certain actions on the Braintrust platform.  \nStaking is a differentiator that can help certain users stand out with their proposals, their jobs, or their referrals.  \n\n**ABOUT:**\nToken Staking should be the second core use case for BTRST tokens as it offers greater control and influence in the network for BTRST token holders. \n\nThere are several options for token staking already discussed in Discord.  So far, options include: \n\n- **Proposal Staking** - Talent adds a BTRST stake to their proposals to show their high level of interest in the project.  Clients keep the stake if the talent doesn\u2019t deliver.  Talent keeps the stake after the first invoice is paid.  \n\n- **Job Staking** - Clients add a BTRST stake to their jobs to incentivize proposals and show commitment to the community pool.  Clients keep the stake if they hire on the BTRST platform.  The stake is distributed to talent if the client does not hire on the BTRST platform. \n\n- **Referral Staking** - Talent adds a reputational stake to their referrals, allowing their talent referrals to skip the screening queue and get to the front of the line.  Referrers keep their stake if the talent is approved.  The stake is returned to the treasury if the referral does not pass the screening.  \n\n\n\n**EXECUTION:**\n- If this proposal passes, I will next propose a consensus check where Braintrust community members can vote on which type of token staking they would like to first implement.  \n- A simple majority vote is required to pass, no quorum is needed.  \n\n**VOTE:**\n- Vote WITH if you are with this proposal\n- Vote AGAINST if you are against this proposal", "choices": ["WITH - Implement Token Staking.", "AGAINST - Do not implement."], "start": 1634052600, "end": 1634626740, "snapshot": "13404411", "state": "closed", "author": "0xdd892d0c8448fE759D2b19b8cbc15793596Cc749", "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth", "name": "Braintrust"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPxeL944X2eyVwxTuHASjTfnhtSKaa4BS5HN149VH59eN", "voter": "0x8E5E8a41E61E41b5A748FB6e0EA6687686c0E11e", "created": 1634579507, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT4Br7mLRjLWspj8q75znLvi3ayYyood4VbFhRaSc9Bim", "voter": "0x55DC546a8b2D06f39f811602A4fD074579bF940D", "created": 1634158266, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSUgfMq3kELPt3jP51q1K76XFo2UrfC7cBHK6cvHgo95y", "voter": "0xC33aa71c518F1D4430fd2CBeaCd402315b3dCbF2", "created": 1634158228, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbeu5qnzEKzT7EtRDoxeKw3PFJPQ2F5T225tSjcqjqZYH", "voter": "0x33F3A1e8fDBc5e85fbA15cA7F00D0098068777f3", "created": 1634107170, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUavSvfeUy6wwM8X1jEoLcNFvSs346rYCLySh1CMrqgUP", "voter": "0xC6eD63963db7489a0633ef9351cE556fB018CEcE", "created": 1634060209, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ6AcAwSUWpyeHdfCyCpxr8H3Pvvb1tfhb99u3HrpLPXV", "voter": "0xdd892d0c8448fE759D2b19b8cbc15793596Cc749", "created": 1634056829, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}]}
