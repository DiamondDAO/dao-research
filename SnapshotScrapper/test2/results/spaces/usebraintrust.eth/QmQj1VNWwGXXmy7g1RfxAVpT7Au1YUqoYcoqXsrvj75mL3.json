And it should sit outside the Governance because it should be just for the website platform and not for Braintrust as a whole. So should house suggestions for things like the job board, profile, integrations, etc. \n\nObviously, this does impact resource management from the BT team but it does significantly increase transparency and user agency.\n\nThe way this could work is a board could be created on Canny.io (or similar) that lists features being worked on, user suggestions, and what has already been implemented from this point forward.\n\nA good example is Zapper's Canny board (https://zapper.canny.io/).\n\nAll this is publicly accessible.", "choices": ["Aye", "Nay"], "start": 1634115600, "end": 1635674400, "snapshot": "13409553", "state": "closed", "author": "0xe9c1b1ED748eC205561e5218B437F905426A6611", "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth", "name": "Braintrust"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmfKiqsPPqSn122d13KVWvyAZtF5qs5gJQJmBibJjawNqb", "voter": "0xdd892d0c8448fE759D2b19b8cbc15793596Cc749", "created": 1634584477, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdePD53p34Xwiu5YBGUcmNJ9amejnbEdZRWJospMEqWPb", "voter": "0xe9c1b1ED748eC205561e5218B437F905426A6611", "created": 1634557985, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfT5zzjhFAnVwuhNCdDh6chdajvN6GfpYXmZZrCBAmygA", "voter": "0x363b39d15CC9A10438F26Fba51D41bC78cEB7fC4", "created": 1634181346, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}]}
