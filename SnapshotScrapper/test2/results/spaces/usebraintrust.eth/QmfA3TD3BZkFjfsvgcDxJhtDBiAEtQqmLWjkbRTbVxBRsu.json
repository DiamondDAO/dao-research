Given that the token value has fallen considerable during the last month, I'm not asking for \"full reimbursement\" but rather just the current number of tokens that were burned.\n\nThere are a number of examples of other communities that have reimbursed users in similar instances in the past. I think this is a great opportunity for Braintrust to step up and help a community member. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any feedback or if you have any other suggestions for reimbursement.\n\nThank you\n", "choices": ["Reimburse 2,810.59 BTRST Tokens", "Find another path for resolution"], "start": 1634169600, "end": 1634774400, "snapshot": "13412976", "state": "closed", "author": "0xA335ADE338308B8e071Cf2c8F3cA5e50F6563C60", "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth", "name": "Braintrust"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmT8N2bE3B7tdBeUEir3y7Q4ywzZppWe4hVTnM1Pcbc6MT", "voter": "0x363b39d15CC9A10438F26Fba51D41bC78cEB7fC4", "created": 1634679305, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVWEbDsnPSiWDVY5mGRhSwMZLsf9SfrCTEjTZjZ7hpKzj", "voter": "0xC6eD63963db7489a0633ef9351cE556fB018CEcE", "created": 1634313028, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUuysFCZESmtEgUzjBHrmX1hQk1P3qAFXcaj38iNRyyed", "voter": "0x33F3A1e8fDBc5e85fbA15cA7F00D0098068777f3", "created": 1634239348, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU1R1SYTgVCaQsLnZzmR2KcS9zJnmieS5rbJPcSBx7JT6", "voter": "0xA0F8FaeD3ed20D4C8E6B422EdFD0A07C69fF9711", "created": 1634232602, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW5sfs3i8sHnW5wmak4krQJxyLkGqVWcf5S6mf31EA5kq", "voter": "0xA335ADE338308B8e071Cf2c8F3cA5e50F6563C60", "created": 1634218055, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}]}
