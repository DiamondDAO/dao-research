", "body": "CONTEXT:\n\nToken Staking is the concept that Braintrust token holders could stake their BTRST tokens to indicate urgency and interest for certain actions on the Braintrust platform.\n\nStaking is a differentiator that can help certain users stand out with their proposals, their jobs, or their referrals.\n\nThe community has recently passed a [Temperature Check](https://snapshot.org/#/usebraintrust.eth/proposal/QmRP7AnJhwCZKb1Mqt9HV9QNopNmshafwxFhCx4SXoKKuQ) that confirmed that there is interest in implementing Token Staking.\u00a0 The purpose of this consensus vote is to determine which of the following Token Staking proposals should be implemented\n\nOPTION OVERVIEW:\n\nThere are several options for token staking already discussed in Discord. So far, options include:\n\n-   Proposal Staking - Talent adds a BTRST stake to their proposals to show their high level of interest in the project. Clients keep the stake if the talent doesn't deliver. Talent keeps the stake after the first invoice is paid.\n\n-   Job Staking - Clients add a BTRST stake to their jobs to incentivize proposals and show commitment to the community pool. Clients keep the stake if they hire on the BTRST platform. The stake is distributed to talent if the client does not hire on the BTRST platform.\n\n-   Referral Staking - Talent adds a reputational stake to their referrals, allowing their talent referrals to skip the screening queue and get to the front of the line. Referrers keep their stake if the talent is approved. The stake is returned to the treasury if the referral does not pass the screening.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nA deeper dive into the rewards, risks, and considerations of each token staking option is explored in this [Staking Proposal Overview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sqf1Zhx0bollsoatuUZzTLCxEldLcOyw4FEwnaCD3io/edit?usp=sharing).\u00a0 This document also includes a scorecard ranking system that analyzes the different options, potential impact, and level of effort to implement.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe last two pages of this document include some data modeling analysis to predict the outcome of the options on GSV.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEXECUTION:\n\n-   If this proposal passes, Braintrust will begin implementing the chosen form of token staking.\n\nVOTE:\n\n-   Vote \"Option 1: Proposal Staking\" if you believe Braintrust should first implement proposal staking, which is available to talent.\n\n-   Vote \"Option 2: Job Staking\" if you believe Braintrust should first implement job staking, which is available to clients.\n\n-   Vote \"Option 3: Referral Staking\" if you believe Braintrust should first implement referral staking, which is available to talent and connector referrers.", "choices": ["Option 1: Proposal Staking", "Option 2: Job Staking", "Option 3: Referral Staking"], "start": 1635278400, "end": 1635800400, "snapshot": "13493585", "state": "closed", "author": "0xdd892d0c8448fE759D2b19b8cbc15793596Cc749", "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth", "name": "Braintrust"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x2a5bab1913c9908a8892f830a107b5fe1b04c15cd6a8086839e6fdf635c9624c", "voter": "0x3425277f9af09097713051882d25D1F7AC49b0c6", "created": 1635795772, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "0x2859800ea89c8c205669f08b095a2cf367dc01d9f9da100ed5627bc8b7f27c4b", "voter": "0x351A26D1B0f64991FB4FE897A9db9FEC62CC7d8f", "created": 1635783903, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "0x50b3ae242d53ec912325adc1cf632eae77e16dfd0781a4072a443457d807faf1", "voter": "0xdd892d0c8448fE759D2b19b8cbc15793596Cc749", "created": 1635548241, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "0x6fc7df0b66b701c2e50ada00e551544a1a81f95e032f638c40d6cf1d8c8fce4e", "voter": "0x1b0Fbe697519d8ff689dE7bEdA80d6e0e0Eb5a73", "created": 1635543444, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "0x02bf01639cf8111b0a0439518399f612a0eb7b7821ae84a13f0c4cc6a6887277", "voter": "0x1fb89B91bf0dfa5AC5e24d52eedD003a10aaC924", "created": 1635521868, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVSyeor1UR6RrTzy8Yd4pS51CkzLiVcNKJPrjKg4om4k9", "voter": "0xA0F8FaeD3ed20D4C8E6B422EdFD0A07C69fF9711", "created": 1635521826, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXkaVHfm3g7Tsh22rK8HL6SErWCT2zmtMjLymN1HvTDw8", "voter": "0xC33aa71c518F1D4430fd2CBeaCd402315b3dCbF2", "created": 1635461655, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "0xcd99bdd6f53a13fbd3eab04e02452f26902dc15ecee6905b1b4abb5dd9cb0845", "voter": "0xF6B3cDaefb5DBc4B9B4ef2054f4A637dF903c778", "created": 1635451542, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "0xf4608d6e0e01fba59a5580520023f972eee3d512fb5b5fc693b1b95bfd6790d6", "voter": "0xd160930b103f59bf66A7Aaaf02Fd800Ef0Fa001c", "created": 1635420305, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "0xddc8b755352578b61f9a56d5c93e76cdc0bcebf1151e79b84b2632d9bb6669c1", "voter": "0x33F3A1e8fDBc5e85fbA15cA7F00D0098068777f3", "created": 1635406101, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "0x36524568775e6bb8725aa622ee585c414dd9fd7c078712d1cf9ba86fc2de39f6", "voter": "0xC6eD63963db7489a0633ef9351cE556fB018CEcE", "created": 1635381820, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRLZKYSPi2yqi7qcZoFL1naRQzhmHgesrPub2RWXDMxak", "voter": "0xa7a64A373634cDc6f51EF77cDFffe30ACEd59F45", "created": 1635362668, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "0x98e42b8bfbca341c56b1bc48a724d50dbb13ec1615c537ae829f48fcc6cd3082", "voter": "0x1F13a73dCf1c03fE752DDDC10dFFD67680B0d326", "created": 1635350566, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0935e0022213dc4d11172774be9d9bccc61a214925c7736d506e129c008c3ec7", "voter": "0x317673D4a3BB3886a23533Af0ff503684988F162", "created": 1635288584, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "0x23a530e284cd65869769c0bfaaa5824314e41803607954c58b379266fcdb6034", "voter": "0x55DC546a8b2D06f39f811602A4fD074579bF940D", "created": 1635284666, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "0x391139c0438dfa9be8fda72d2aa7e95aeab7acbb00f3967308da662f53790ef7", "voter": "0xD12c97401683228261eF5445efDC309Cbfc2d8bd", "created": 1635284235, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}]}
