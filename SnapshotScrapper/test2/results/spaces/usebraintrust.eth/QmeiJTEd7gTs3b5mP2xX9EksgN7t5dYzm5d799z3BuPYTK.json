Fortunately, this resulted in no loss of BTRST tokens stolen from the treasury, but it did create unusable accounts and highlighted a need to add another level of protection to prevent and discourage fraud in the future. \n\n### PROBLEM:\n- A Know Your Customer solution (KYC) would enable Braintrust to validate the identity of individual users and make it far more difficult for bots to perform token performing activities on the platform.  \n      - Users would need to submit documentation proving their identity.\n      - Braintrust wouldn\u2019t store the information and would go through a third-party vendor to process and clear users.  \n- A Know Your Customer solution (KYC) would preserve the integrity of the Braintrust token and enable more automated BTRST token earning activities (like Braintrust Academy).  \n- A Know Your Customer solution (KYC) would eliminate the current manual and labor-intensive prevention mechanisms used to identify duplicate users on the platform that are attempting to earn tokens across multiple identities.  \n\n### SOLUTION:\nI propose that Braintrust explores a Know Your Customer solution.  \n\n### ADDITIONAL USE CASES TO EXPLORE:\nThe following are use cases to explore as a community.  Passage of this proposal enables a continuance of this conversation, it does not finalize use cases: \n- Some Braintrust Clients request background checks on talent.  Talent could preemptively use their BTRST tokens to pay for an add-on background check (on top of KYC) that verifies identity and background as clear as a differentiator for their proposals.\n- In an effort to control costs associated with KYC, we could gate activities before KYC is used: \n1. Activate referral link\n2. Unlock the Braintrust Academy courses and associated rewards\n3. Withdraw tokens\n4. Become Verified (approved) Talent\n\n\n### EXECUTION:\nIf this proposal passes, a community-led committee would be convened to evaluate at least three third-party solutions.  \n1. Cost Analysis\n1. Workflow / How it would Work\n1. Risks\n1. Rewards\n1. User Experience\n1. Performance\n1. SLA/Support\n\nThe three solutions would be presented to the community for the final vote on which solution should be implemented.  The consensus vote would include an option to not implement a KYC solution. \n\n### VOTE:\n- Vote **WITH** if you would like to continue exploring a KYC solution at Braintrust.  \n- Vote **AGAINST** if you do not want to explore a KYC solution at Braintrust. \n\n\n", "choices": ["WITH - Explore KYC option", "Against - Do not explore KYC"], "start": 1633666800, "end": 1634021940, "snapshot": "13375988", "state": "closed", "author": "0xdd892d0c8448fE759D2b19b8cbc15793596Cc749", "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth", "name": "Braintrust"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmacS9B2fcGZoGbqFnCEau6MRHPyvhtTTwVKSQq8BeW3ni", "voter": "0xFb032693428B308093504D7e36d25Bfdf3101539", "created": 1633981762, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYBs7d7da9ZbULyzJLMgj35RTdGcbVHCEM2ESfSxMUrqL", "voter": "0xdd892d0c8448fE759D2b19b8cbc15793596Cc749", "created": 1633965915, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRbKZa4X4DVpCJCjJypCmmwaamVoEb8img8dSyC3eZp8A", "voter": "0x7C5139838a211D76E16f87D7780fd78e60dE06d2", "created": 1633804541, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbTpEGkfLPjinijgQ7wsr6xkxXkrwaHCN2YsSj6TDrgc7", "voter": "0xC6eD63963db7489a0633ef9351cE556fB018CEcE", "created": 1633794296, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQzDRaj13Mozaz4EJz7QVtypWXZSEeMqnw9DAC11EPLvx", "voter": "0x55DC546a8b2D06f39f811602A4fD074579bF940D", "created": 1633719693, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmScfayUdQRR9hHaxTDT6pFu3iWeLxSS3w6YLjn2hb5AMN", "voter": "0xC33aa71c518F1D4430fd2CBeaCd402315b3dCbF2", "created": 1633713971, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXGr9BWpM8obJtfR8pwrnamaFEP6nHycMj9kgr1Nwfjt4", "voter": "0x33F3A1e8fDBc5e85fbA15cA7F00D0098068777f3", "created": 1633710525, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS9d2GZPKKsmyB1oH2XJS9t7ka1Yk35Y24Y3e8gdih2b4", "voter": "0x363b39d15CC9A10438F26Fba51D41bC78cEB7fC4", "created": 1633666971, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "usebraintrust.eth"}}]}
