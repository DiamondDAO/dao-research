It allows you to raise an objection to the publication of the official PoS Working Group statement on the BMF draft regulations.  If you raise an objection this will be noted and your company name can be removed from the proposed publication. This will not however stand in the way of the opinion being published (due to the looming submission deadline (Monday, 19. Juli 2021). \n\nOnly in the case that a majority of the total validator members oppose the publication will we move back to the drawing board. In case of individual objections, individual action will be taken instead. The plan is to send out the document to the BMF by close of business on 16 July (Tomorrow) and the voting will be open until 17:00 CET on 16 July. Following that, final changes to the document will be undertaken and it will be shipped.\n\nDraft response: (Stellungnahme)\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/192UbXHYpYuWk8-8sPRDnCHlqriPm3zP5/view?usp=sharing", "choices": ["Yes!
