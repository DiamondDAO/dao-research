Problems\n\nA. Currently, the ratio of Genesis Mining in HD is too much compared to circulation. In addition, this is not done through HD, but is mined with HDT. This cannot generate additional demand factors for HD, but rather is a negative factor that causes selling power. Even if HD will be unlocked for 50 weeks, the same is true.\n\nB. In the case of the current Genesis Mining Round, the structure is designed to be advantageous to HDT miners acquired through external ecological coins rather than the advantages given to HD holders. This also doesn't add value to HD.\n\nC. Currently, HD tokens are only circulating in centralized exchanges. I don't think this is the right direction for the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nD. The HDT mined by the miners is not valued. This lowers the morale of HDT miners.\n\nE. It\u2019s needed to compensate for these initial design mistakes.\n\n\n\n2. Proposals\n\nA. I propose to change the structure of HD Genesis Mining 2round.\n\n1) Using Uniswap, create HD/ETH and HDT/ETH pools to generate HD LP and HDT LP tokens.\n\n1.1) Change HD Genesis Mining 2round\u2019s token mining distribution.\n\n1.1.1) Use HD LP tokens to mine 80% of HD tokens distributed in Genesis Mining Round 2.\n\n1.1.2) Use HD tokens to mine 15% of HD tokens distributed in Genesis Mining Round 2.\n\n1.1.3) Use HDT LP tokens to mine 5% of HD tokens distributed in Genesis Mining Round 2.\n\n\n1.2) Change HDT token mining distribution\n\n1.2.1) Use HDT LP tokens to mine 80% of HDT tokens.\n\n1.2.3) Use HD LP tokens to mine 5% of HDT tokens.\n\n1.2.4) Use other tokens to mine 15% of HDT tokens.\n\n\n\nB. I propose to change the duration of HD Genesis Mining 2round.\n\n1) Currently, HD Genesis Mining is designed to mine for 1 week and divide it for 50 weeks. However, this method cannot increase the value of HD. Therefore, I propose HD Genesis Mining 2Round as an immediate distribution for 50 weeks.\n\n2) This method will increase the value of HD tokens by encouraging HD mining through HD LP tokens.\n\n\nC. I propose to increase the value of HD by issuing new tokens to compensate for initial design mistakes.\n\n\n* It is suggested that voting be held for one week to determine whether the above matters proceed. All of the above are suggested for the stability of the entire HubDAO ecosystem, so I hope for active acceptance.\n\n\n\uc800\ub294 HD \ubc0f HDT\uc758 \ud640\ub354\uc774\uba70, DeFi\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc751\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uc800\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 HD Genesis Mining \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uba70, \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc774 \ubcc0\uacbd\ud560 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\n1. \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\n\nA. \ud604\uc7ac HD\uc758 Genesis Mining\uc758 \ube44\uc728\uc774 \uc720\ud1b5\ub7c9 \ub300\ube44, \ub108\ubb34 \uacfc\ub2e4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc774\ub294 HD\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc44\uad74\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\uace0, HDT\ub85c \ucc44\uad74\uc774 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 HD\uc758 \ucd94\uac00 \ub9e4\uc218\uc138\ub97c \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70, \uc624\ud788\ub824 \ub9e4\ub3c4\uc138\ub97c \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubd80\uc815\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. 50\uc8fc\uac04 Unlock\uc744 \ud558\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4, \ub9c8\ucc2c\uac00\uc9c0\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\nB. \ud604\uc7ac Genesis Mining Round\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0, HD \ud640\ub354\uc5d0\uac8c \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uc774\uc810\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \uc0dd\ud0dc \ucf54\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud68d\ub4dd\ud55c HDT \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd \uc720\uc800\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5b4\uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub610\ud55c HD\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uc544\ub2d9\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\nC. \ud604\uc7ac HD \ud1a0\ud070\uc740 \uc911\uc559\ud654 \uac70\ub798\uc18c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub9cc \uc720\ud1b5\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc800\ub294 \uc774\uac83\uc774 DeFi \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\nD. \ub9c8\uc774\ub108\ub4e4\uc774 \ucc44\uad74\ud55c HDT\uc758 \uac00\uce58\uac00 \ucc45\uc815\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 HDT \ub9c8\uc774\ub108\ub4e4\uc758 \uc0ac\uae30\ub97c \uc800\ud558\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\nE. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucd08\uae30 \uc124\uacc4 \uc2e4\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\n\n2. \uc81c\uc548 \uc0ac\ud56d\n\nA.
