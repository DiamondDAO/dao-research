Polyvertex unfortunately did not have that luxury and despite a successful launch, investor interest has dried up. We\u2019re in need of a cash infusion in order to invest in the development of this DEFI application such as an audit from the big three, new developers, marketing and finally, improvements to the UI for the purpose of differentiating ourselves and improving user experience.\n\nFortunately, there is a solution, Cross-Chain development! During the beginning of a farm, investors often flood in for high yields bringing in deposits fee\u2019s and overall TVL. It also allows developers to generate more income as they can sell at open market fetching a high price due to the initial higher market-cap. Through cross-chain development Polyvertex has the opportunity to generate high yields to fund further growth of its ecosystem to new heights. In turn, it will also bring attention to Polyvertex on the polygon chain; potentially renewing interest and being able to leverage our existing investment on polygon to our benefit for example:\n\na. The farm has been around for approximately two months \u2013 low risk of a rug and is trusted.\n\nb. The developers have KYC\u2019d already. Another element of trust.\n\nc. We have an existing strong community and partnerships that we can work with.\n\nWith that been said, for the first cross chain expansion I would to recommend the following two chains:\n\nBinance Smart Chain: due to the low transaction fees, stability, and existing popularity. BSC presents an opportunity due to its maturity when compared to other chains and sits up there in Total Value Locked and therefore has a wider audience/customer base.\n\nArbitrum: For the exact opposite reason as above, due to arbitrum being new, Polyvertex has an opportunity to gain popularity as a first mover in that space and attract new bridged capital.\n\nI believe this is the next step to help fund the development of Polyvertex and renew investor interest as well as bring in a potentially lucrative second source of revenue. If this proposal passes, we will build out a strategy with the intention of partner proposals and marketing prior to launch.\n\nProvided this proposal is accepted, as we\u2019re a community oriented DEFI protocol there will be a number of other proposals to follow in order to choose how we will develop across a new chain. Primarily:\n\nWe will need to decide whether we will mint an entirely new token that is separate from polygon or keep our existing token and split emissions across the two chains.\n\nIn order to help this expansion, benefit the market cap and token price of Vert on Polygon, a proposal will be created to decide the following: Relative to their holdings of VERT and VERT LP. Reward a ratio of the new token,  \u201cratio to be voted on\u201d or perhaps an airdrop relative to their holdings if we decide to not create a new token.\n\nThis will help drive growth and ownership on the polygon side as well as benefit and lead by example that Polyvertex rewards its long-term supporters for Hodling.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this proposal", "choices": ["Launch on Binance Smart Chain", "Launch on Arbitrum", "Other to be voted on", "Remain solely on Polygon"], "start": 1631822400, "end": 1632168000, "snapshot": "19178538", "state": "closed", "author": "0x75043Ac1Ac8300483E32B9bccCcaA340b18D2bB7", "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth", "name": "Vertex Finance"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXZFD7g9HTo7KcMoFJ4sPPJSTMo9jbFbsx2QJxxZRnhmS", "voter": "0x3d04adb5061dd930680D530B1158B50a7cbe57a4", "created": 1632155181, "choice": {"2": 3, "4": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdPMtb8urbrrBzmSGiNacZT77JWt6YANWVeWeDvenbjXi", "voter": "0x9117F74adcc19b767DBBF6Af7B08E33d8702A2D4", "created": 1632155130, "choice": {"2": 3, "4": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTZyEsyWpwESEZFK5BuN5QnxM29FV7k46TSyYnZ5fdxt3", "voter": "0x044C8B5F4083fed980E055A769114AC8a794DDce", "created": 1632155096, "choice": {"2": 3, "4": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZLANypjsvWxw1e7TatURBCK89KHUEhnwbNjcSam5PWsR", "voter": "0x90BE94eaa59387FfeaC2EF6a866398D1C85E1FD8", "created": 1632155045, "choice": {"2": 3, "4": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdjDLpW9j7ohWToeffbuHe6N9SQGCZq9YDqEiSdv7u6MK", "voter": "0x3A5D53f76737c9f6651D292CC348A84611C41917", "created": 1632154967, "choice": {"2": 3, "4": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWL1v5EPb16r8nfWcRu6w48noXzZtdfAGi3HSTQTa2zLJ", "voter": "0xAC78D039Cf16dD194f2cbE456239951d3D338331", "created": 1632143347, "choice": {"4": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNugpFjNyRkSr2j3AXkkMVFYU1W1Ji5eMe6mh6zZt1mxr", "voter": "0x7a120D3150530a1Cb538711eF04623aA8D90fF4E", "created": 1632106262, "choice": {"2": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYDxRfXyVawDPamQUSokzpQi1w3BU55eMuSuTQPQk7XTB", "voter": "0x36533fA26F038b4A17e585Bf8C326903959BBf0b", "created": 1632029738, "choice": {"4": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRKFuJV4M63Fsw3xGcTT5KobjS51kbNYUfHPBskKk4GMu", "voter": "0xB88D5496411b41e69aC7e49B013A5DA6447acce6", "created": 1632005158, "choice": {"1": 1, "3": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVuVexrERBFHfcVdTaEUGat4sBMJseA8QmCqa8zHh6Ps6", "voter": "0x75043Ac1Ac8300483E32B9bccCcaA340b18D2bB7", "created": 1631998305, "choice": {"1": 1, "2": 1, "3": 1, "4": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXQxxg5bsErEbHdQ6jkjCzCe49mVgFoneTh7zXP5absvg", "voter": "0x1c634804ba4f83a66134cd92961066F7adC6B928", "created": 1631998166, "choice": {"1": 1, "2": 1, "3": 1, "4": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS1gS2M2fSPnCoCcGygpAF44gqj21Bkk7VcRjbEYJLCwY", "voter": "0x3ACC73A5E87c24CDe92c69a52a9db9f5EE55294B", "created": 1631994842, "choice": {"1": 1, "2": 1, "3": 1, "4": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaL4rYP7tsRFkmEny8FmSS8ZbZwoktxUrWRAxV34tDXWd", "voter": "0x7F2e54d53258Dc45b8581f11F924075146608D19", "created": 1631941349, "choice": {"2": 112}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNQ989VzPeBjUww1vKrpw3xMVviWiDD5tKDuRoTUPQfP6", "voter": "0xcCB9c2B79C5e2a3d82aD6Cd7e4924648A776BB19", "created": 1631900576, "choice": {"1": 2, "2": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfDeQ9tw4wnm6G4N3smyGUu5ML9nCNZR3QrjZ4V691fJm", "voter": "0xDdFFeEE2C39D3c6F96295fDf4ff7355b9B3f35cF", "created": 1631895683, "choice": {"2": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSrb3RKDLk4N8secfKeUDAuWUDob4RvDj1ZmA1NUdxGDt", "voter": "0x28Aa5c6653bF726A70EC922Dc310dBcfb90C7dC6", "created": 1631870032, "choice": {"1": 1, "2": 1}, "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}]}
