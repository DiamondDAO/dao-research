One of the candidates has dropped out, and the voting style has been simplified.*\n\n---\n\nWelcome to the first ever proposal writing delegate elections.\n\nNever before has a tokenized governance at launch...\n\n- Released with an anti-whale function.\n- Hybridized their democracy.\n- Held elections for proposal writers.\n\n***We're making history here.***\n\nBefore voting, please review our updated governance documentation, now with a section on Delegates, a section on Countering Voter Fraud, a video overview, and updated voting participation minimums: https://docs.polyvertex.finance/general/governance\n\n## MEET THE CANDIDATES\n\nPlease take some time below to review each candidate. Each one has their own vision on what it takes to move the project forward. Feel free to scan the Telegram chat for their username: https://t.me/polyvertex\n\nUsers are listed in order of acceptance.\n\n### Crocodile Arms (@crocodile_arms)\n\nCrocodile Arms is extremely dedicated as he is long winded. He has the ability to break down complex things and deep dive into all angles. He's written the first proposal and will train others to do the same.\n\n### V K (V)\n\nWilling to take suggestions and turn them into proposals. Short and sweet and to the point. V K has recommended Route as the strong alternative to entering the DFYN ecosystem, and recently has shown interest in seeing PolyVertex have more presence on Reddit. He has recently been added to the core team as an advisor and to help with AMA's when possible.\n\n### TheKidd (@ThaCryptoKidd)\n\nTheKidd is interested in attracting new investors and using successful launches as a model for PolyVertex success. In particular, he has mentioned cross-chain development as being a perfect second shot opportunity for a major breakthrough in investor interest.\n\n### K2X (@x_K2X_x)\n\nK2X has a knack for find the missing pieces to puzzle and knowing when something needs to be investigated. He would like to see PolyVertex fill some of the holes Polygon has left unfilled in its ecosystem compared to major chains. He believes that Web 3.0 is the next revolutionary innovation where the Internet becomes a huge  decentralized/tokenized network.\n\n### Sam (@Chadwick777)\n\nSam is an individual capable of writing detailed information on focused topics. He's unstoppable when he dives in. For example, he organized the joint AMA with EvoDefi.\n\n### Manuel DB (@manuel_db)\n\nManuel is passionate about bringing stronger trust between the core members and its community and will provide a voice for the community and accountability to the core team. Manuel is a great thinker and cares about vision and fundamentals.\n\n### PuppyMonkeyPoly (@VegasPackFan)\n\nPuppyMonkeyPoly would like to see more utility for VERT and a stronger brand on our unique value propositions. He has been an active contributor for some time and is always scoping out the latest projects for the most interesting ideas to build upon. Has taken up interest in our future NFT system.\n\n## VOTING\n\nVoting for delegates is not a simple \"pick your favorite\" style of vote such as the first proposal. This proposal uses approval voting.\n\n### REMINDER: GET ENOUGH VERT POWER FOR THE SNAPSHOT\n\nThe snapshot is the block on Polygon where you must have voting power. See our [governance documentation](https://docs.polyvertex.finance/general/governance) on how snapshot works and how your voting power is calculated. Every vote counts, even the little ones, so take up as much VERT as you can before the snapshot occurs. The link to the snapshot is in the upper right hand corner of this page.\n\nIf you have zero voting power when you go to vote or zero power at the snapshot, you will not be able to vote or it will not be counted, respectively. Keep as much as you can on hand and have some crypto dust in reserves.\n\n### HOW TO VOTE\n\nFor approval voting, select all the candidates you think deserve a shot. Each candidate will receive 100% of your voting power, like a bunch of mini-proposals. As such, quorum is practically meaningless, but each candidate's votes can be evaluated with the modified plurality rules shown below:\n\n**Minimums to Become Elected:**\n\n- **1.75% of weekly active wallets at the start time of the proposal**\n- **20% of voting power of highest vote**\n\nEven if you are not sure now, **you have time until the proposal closes to change your vote.** You have nothing to lose if you vote now, but a candidate who does not make it because of voter procrastination does lose out.\n\nThis is not a competitive campaign. So long as the election reaches minimum targets, the candidates will get elected and begin the process. ***We need more delegates than less, so vote for everyone unless you disagree with them becoming a delegate.*** \n\nRemember, everyone can win. Diversity is key to progress.\n\n# Vote for everyone you like and everyone who deserves an opportunity to prove themselves.", "choices": ["Crocodile Arms", "V K", "TheKidd", "K2X", "Sam", "Manuel DB", "PuppyMonkeyPoly"], "start": 1629863940, "end": 1630799940, "snapshot": "18715000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3ACC73A5E87c24CDe92c69a52a9db9f5EE55294B", "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth", "name": "Vertex Finance"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmY9nFwH6m8EoVNLHKSgkRjfZRXzXwd2S6XtJhff3LdNvX", "voter": "0x7F2e54d53258Dc45b8581f11F924075146608D19", "created": 1630779515, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbyyeDU1vNwx3LPgNVRh1NX4Ush9w3S9z8DVCjUDfXc2c", "voter": "0x28Aa5c6653bF726A70EC922Dc310dBcfb90C7dC6", "created": 1630651197, "choice": [1, 3], "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ77GC6xEcwyPQER25WJtfNnEp84AvwM6iEySPpHSJvQb", "voter": "0xC8e2D5fE62fC0F9c1680bc07546a1d6B758FDD1A", "created": 1630648150, "choice": [2, 1, 6, 5], "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNkJXq9JSjj5sAq4BpXwSg8S23RcXkb6buuciCEpscFwa", "voter": "0xB88D5496411b41e69aC7e49B013A5DA6447acce6", "created": 1630641501, "choice": [1, 2, 3], "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbVWsuv1MakE37KxY4FjrEkWmWEtpkqw4NZFTCpBWHbyi", "voter": "0xBb188Da1FCDbeF44d3546135240e2ae116E4AC1B", "created": 1630629687, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZBakGupsam69QkRm11NVxDMtBCoitrqqgTNeLafnXtiS", "voter": "0x1c634804ba4f83a66134cd92961066F7adC6B928", "created": 1630623092, "choice": [3, 7, 1], "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTbe7GqvVCuQNPZUHntxctypard9aLT6bUa3H4eHciwMZ", "voter": "0xAC78D039Cf16dD194f2cbE456239951d3D338331", "created": 1630598945, "choice": [1, 5, 7, 4], "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSG1AK9p3kwcD3TwQt1JGMqxWuMiDTrPQGsdF28NFivqw", "voter": "0x3ACC73A5E87c24CDe92c69a52a9db9f5EE55294B", "created": 1630581367, "choice": [7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 6], "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZxLXp6Nay4dRDBdPZHT4turbcWwMZk96G6RRgtPVSJhc", "voter": "0xcCB9c2B79C5e2a3d82aD6Cd7e4924648A776BB19", "created": 1630573829, "choice": [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2], "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth"}}]}
