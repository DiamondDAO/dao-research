Organized by lowest to highest TVL as of the start of this proposal. Values will fluctuate. Being that this will become a regular activity, proposals are numbered OR1, OR2, etc. for offering removals and OA1, OA2, for offering additions.*\n\n## Select any pool you do ***not*** use and do ***not*** intend on using.", "choices": ["WBTC-USDC ($143)", "WMATIC-USDC ($723)", "USDC ($950)", "WETH-USDC ($1405)", "WETH ($2894)", "USDT ($2918)", "WBTC ($3109)", "WMATIC ($3850)"], "start": 1632499200, "end": 1632844800, "snapshot": "19451914", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3ACC73A5E87c24CDe92c69a52a9db9f5EE55294B", "space": {"id": "polyvertex.eth", "name": "Vertex Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
