Thus contributing to an increased price impact. The AQUA-BNB & AQUA-CAKE vault multipliers are each 25x. The TVL in the BNB & CAKE pools is over $2 million while the BUSD pool is sitting below 500K. The APY in the BUSD pool is currently higher, but it wouldn't take much new liquidity to cut that in half.\n\nPrice Impact Calculation:\n10 AQUA -> 4.197 BNB  = .1% price impact\n10 AQUA -> 1190 BUSD = .57% price impact\n\nThe price impact when trading AQUA utilizing BUSD is almost 6x that of BNB. Increasing the TVL will help stabilize the price of AQUA and minimize the large price fluctuations per trade.\n\nThe community should vote on what the new AQUA-BUSD vault multiplier should be, with the option of keeping it as is.", "choices": ["25x (equal to BNB/CAKE pairs)", "20x", "15x", "5x (remain the same)"], "start": 1626713400, "end": 1626799800, "snapshot": "9298380", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9Dd317ca17082e31f4aF50686EFAa6dCfFCF37C0", "space": {"id": "planetfinance.eth", "name": "Planet Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
