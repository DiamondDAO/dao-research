Once we pay off our first contribution we use ALL of the mining revenue for more farms until we get at least 3 running. At that point, we cut down how much goes to mining and start paying rewards to holders.\nBy doing this we will eliminate the need to constantly pull from funding and will eventually not even need it.\n\nCommunity\n\nSubmmited By:\n\n0xf81C76315E5F1f8aD36e609A3B1E4a76be98703B", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1636167600, "end": 1636426800, "snapshot": "12405687", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6D2FF65B04f47aF0b3d784a425CFD000dbF3baa4", "space": {"id": "vote.solarmoon.eth", "name": "Solar Moon Crypto"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x12213da63cd6028158223ea11d9bafb8c083504b2bc0075454d54450111c9287", "voter": "0x81D6dBfb2ec09E618BBf8A97f2c30a9545eEBF82", "created": 1636345453, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.solarmoon.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSwEXfGeotAtKfACcfzckHKuiiHA6vaB6uHSMxWE1nzGY", "voter": "0x43347293eC482c17895c2de16A3a73926B6B6466", "created": 1636185832, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "vote.solarmoon.eth"}}]}
