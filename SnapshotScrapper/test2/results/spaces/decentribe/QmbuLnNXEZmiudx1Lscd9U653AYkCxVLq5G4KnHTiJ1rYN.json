So far the team has: \n\n-Released an in-depth white paper providing an overview of Decentribe's vision and short- and long-term objectives \n-Spent time and financial resources developing the concept, initial game art and NFTs for CoinEmpire \n-Developed and released Crypto Races and Crypto Challenge, a dapp featuring short-term price prediction markets \n-Developed and distributed TRIBE and the DECENT governance token to the community\n\nOur next planned step has always been to launch the CoinEmpire NFT Genesis sale, which will enable community members to purchase chests featuring a bundle of NFTs, TRIBE and DECENT tokens. The Genesis Sale proceeds are to be used to fund development of CoinEmpire and to support CryptoChallenge and Crypto Races. \n\nNow we are asking the community to participate in a vote that will determine the future of the Decentribe project. \n\nAs outlined in the white paper, we have prepared for the CoinEmpire Genesis sale where we will be raising funds for the following purposes (read up about the sale here: https://bit.ly/3ljWBue): \n\n1. Continue CoinEmpire development \n2. Market the Decentribe project in order to expand the community and ignite engagement / interest in the project. (We will also use TRIBE tokens allocated for marketing as well)\n3. Fund the existing Crypto Races (provide ongoing races sponsored by the team) \n4. Increase liquidity for the TRIBE  and establish liquidity for the DECENT token\n\nWe are also including a possible step prior to the Genesis Sale, which is to mint some TRIBE tokens in order to market our project to a bigger crowd through airdrops and other events. A small part of this batch would be sold to fund the CryptoChallenge(Races) mobile port.\n\nBefore launching the sale, we would like to determine the community's interest in the sale and get a sense of what the community feels is an achievable fundraising goal. \n\nPlease, using a wallet with DECENT tokens, provide your view on the CoinEmpire Genesis Sale fundraising goal that would be appropriate for us to target at this stage\n\n1. Fundraising Goal 50 ETH (Marketing, provides some support for Crypto Challenge  - funding races) \n2. Fundraising Goal 150 ETH (Marketing, CryptoChallenge support, CoinEmpire development)\n3. Fundraising Goal 300 ETH (Marketing, CryptoChallenge support, CoinEmpire development, initial funding; TRIBE/DECENT Liquidity) \n4. Minting 500K TRIBE (Marketing, CryptoChallenge mobile support; TRIBE/DECENT Liquidity)", "choices": ["50 ETH", "150 ETH", "300 ETH", "500K TRIBE"], "start": 1605178800, "end": 1606388400, "snapshot": "11241658", "state": "closed", "author": "0xaf10Fd21B2E1a7221f5BAEE17a61D7489E3D7E8B", "space": {"id": "decentribe", "name": "Decentribe"}, "votes": 18, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmagycBSPxQayyKQ7XCNEjV7ACt7HnZENAMMBr5Y88CF3n", "voter": "0x50d737e3fE3e060007c68AD5E892Ae45FE271027", "created": 1606302211, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmdKinw1ao6K5h2d85JhWCwiFD6mu34jKj1d8jZ2jgvHGT", "voter": "0x91bB3B444c4aE8eA86EF3D75E7D34010c4bE62C8", "created": 1606248174, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmdVwdwn6YMCw44QycH3VeMdmNKPzsCGzLj74ahSxTDgDv", "voter": "0x3B3a56458E037c694D2DdC5f620531eCeBdE29f7", "created": 1606152823, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmRhpkRzohb3U9ffjTVwwg8ZknWCApp8ZQJ64hCVCHSiFt", "voter": "0xb5cbe28F9eC51Bd208cd7FECd0B71b4d86F77A77", "created": 1605979010, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmQAXXYh1zrBbJf8YALWtSCYYMPiwAkrryPmvvkVRLXisp", "voter": "0xBB91239340fa13451b01F7F3C97FF9362B269Db1", "created": 1605769468, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmcwnkZx56MjySRmzQHs1eN93cXHGWBaNDwMwL17m2HAQj", "voter": "0x12f8622Bb94Ebe9BDD5b29d7762c0bfc06C1E401", "created": 1605675951, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "Qmd9h2NnpjGN6MZCNkVteQ2LgKbR8XnsSeur9f7hZsj2QE", "voter": "0x89eCCEEc77B11172382d452217E9ef635c013275", "created": 1605623735, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmVk1TabDAZxaGbTXJ7Jt1AG6ZuJkf82mMZZJFVZ76mCWk", "voter": "0x42a3FDad947807f9FA84B8c869680A3B7A46bEe7", "created": 1605542963, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmeJR6pXFrBRP8H2nuU8oDfDvRm8uGWoXqe9vKQ61PLEmB", "voter": "0xe25f30ec58980a933C95a53cCf2D08d9fB60d201", "created": 1605483566, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmP43e9cByzJ6dtxnPgv3Upg7jteR4esxHvsh7MkDwVDUE", "voter": "0x7dc2d7105A6c34b107c2F57C3A49954f41Df15fE", "created": 1605476505, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmPV7AnJkHCixxHboNz4YKRXcB2qFEuSLyh9FFrzykHDBu", "voter": "0xa0904227ffb90D5B259e9343B9FFfEF10466dBd0", "created": 1605389876, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmSDJMVEjE9dGjejNDTUJZrCM5vigk3FRqm62t7dB6PPoK", "voter": "0xa81931577fCd345D4Dda9a92F1bBAa0B5f7FaDd5", "created": 1605389876, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmXhWpHEXENu4sCKQAgjFqVMeFC88gwjxXwFVB6CTU5feS", "voter": "0xA85F0D90Aed5215d0e8f4712a8356817C63D7f17", "created": 1605369840, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmeyVma1u5aFLW13oKQCTM53eSNh916PsAZ6Tn92KopHHH", "voter": "0xC221725Ca3f6C0f4df65042Eeb65682362eCa407", "created": 1605281206, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmeE33doV7mLLfkNsgHbT9dai3iK1AT3pNc3yxv7GdWXUX", "voter": "0x8AA54E2602cb8F8742e810b00CD4b4954AaC4F92", "created": 1605253217, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmbwmnWA4xVCzdbAwWZAQdjPsnydyAupytPEeRFNZZMgVZ", "voter": "0x871c8E3c7ee9086c0306f11fc272Ca18Daa58dBD", "created": 1605203250, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmNxGdru6nWX1uxdDHd4924u8hvtAyJyjwhEdUze2nHvk4", "voter": "0xF5e635FC3c795c11AE6B58e38828CDF962845ac6", "created": 1605203017, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}, {"id": "QmVpHScgAZi5CuvMEmcGSySJM98MSD3DZEfptZiDcC3Ryz", "voter": "0x36A0742d75CfBA8e2981b307C156e1de6EBd88A7", "created": 1605178995, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "decentribe"}}]}
