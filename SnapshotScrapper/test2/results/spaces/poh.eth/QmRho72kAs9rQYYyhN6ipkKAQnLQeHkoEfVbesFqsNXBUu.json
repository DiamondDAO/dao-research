In addition, the current group of people managing the website, snapshot, and forum are designated as an interim board for the duration of 1 year after approval.\n\nAbstract\nFor the dao to function, it requires trusted members to act as advisors to the management as well as a check on it. This board should handle the access to funds and resources to the management, monitor their performance, and ensure that the technical implementation of voting and other procedures are securely implemented.\n\nThese task are naturally already handled by the informal leaders instituted by the creators of the Dao. However, this proposal would give them a formal mandate by the community and put a time limit before the board positions would become individually elected.\n\nSince the DAO does not yet have a robust mechanism for voting the second part of the proposal is that the current members filling this task from Kleros and Democracy.Earth will be formalized as the interim board for the period of 1 year after approval.\n\nMotivation\nAt the moment, the creators of the DAO have control of all resources as a trusted group. However, to have a democratic institution this power needs to be under democratic control. In addition, the employees of the DAO need to be treated consistently by the same group of people to ensure good working conditions.\n\nSpecification\nThe current informal managers, from Kleros and Democracy.Earth are formalized as the \u201cMission Board\u201d for a period of 1 year after adoption.\n[complete list of people will be added for phase 3]\n\nThereafter elections should be held for the positions on the board before the end of the 1-year interim period.\n\nThe mission board will jointly manage the following:\n\nTechnical implementation of voting\nAccess to critical wallets.\nAccess right to funds by management\nPayment to employees\nAny resource requiring high trust by the community\nIn addition the board will\n\nAdvise management, administer their payment, and monitor their performance.\nAdjudicate if the proper procedure is followed on passing proposals.\nBe authorized to issue mission statements on behalf of the DAO.\nRationale\nThe proposal is meant to improve democratic control but not disrupt current operations. The role of the board is what is already being done by a trusted group or will be done in the near future. But this group would have some difficulty explaining their special role with no democratic mandate.\n\nWe could decide to elect a board immediately, but since we don\u2019t yet have defined voting robust procedures we would run a serious risk of taking a lot of time with this and disrupting the progress on other fronts. This is why the option of elevating the current informal leaders to elected (accept/reject) status but for only 1 year.\n\n** Implementation **\nNothing really changes, except that elections must be held for the board positions before the year is out. If possible the board members should be marked as such on Discourse.", "choices": ["Yes - create", "No - don't create"], "start": 1621591200, "end": 1622023200, "snapshot": "12476570", "state": "closed", "author": "0x77E851A926297fff2E6BC8FDbB5bB6087a617eC5", "space": {"id": "poh.eth", "name": "Proof Of Humanity"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdiJa7EXcCQdPhct1aLiuDX7vjktoEgHmsKm36Q9XYz3L", "voter": "0xe126b3E5d052f1F575828f61fEBA4f4f2603652a", "created": 1622014954, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYQ7sFj7X9DwRGusddYUTr9mhHcPoSeu6nmdTgSdKoAUc", "voter": "0x5Af2d81e42935A11358B8dE9cecEE600254c470b", "created": 1621729405, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXgHMJ25QBjYBkKUhMf75rAp8QsNguoEuyucucyn7w2zC", "voter": "0xae9504CbB923A48456bE55d75B637C8428575321", "created": 1621699808, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPCBevrPa97GbCZuAWinuzFzpSrjcexRuNcMvYEVJkEjD", "voter": "0x3cFAfcfE84BD1c5EED3d56EDF3dc482DE67a2e18", "created": 1621699119, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXtUQpGSQCgFsKAxjChTAH6V9H4Nx9z8cfSBzULe7bRpW", "voter": "0x06c00C12e945BBE5A056Ce4A6193F8350151042a", "created": 1621695773, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcXecPv8GiUN1h5D8BdYiw9naNd5U7cu5jYLijcTFeaH9", "voter": "0xF49A19f72d0E106df462CfD6B5BEBE42b6001616", "created": 1621695739, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPUXWj6MU7hMxe99hTDLTZ6612zxPZaJpcGSH2iJTUAUL", "voter": "0x66bE3e825cC2555A73546b9fBF28211055418d80", "created": 1621692329, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeJFxF3KeSx26nYRQojeAVP7FtpikwfFXf6JmrBQ7VVTe", "voter": "0x15B3f5060788Ff10622e4568d2070bf4C821080f", "created": 1621682402, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdTGqaFaQY1CHRyKRHXu7b6fLb7wJPt8GuGmLJfmjvyyf", "voter": "0x0B209CEA5D15801a5Ad620670EeBC116a733932a", "created": 1621682384, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcfwoWnWHAcfqp1VNj8p9Hnsx6n8azdW2SjCNmf1A3Nkj", "voter": "0x0D0b5C63bcb54566e7Ce6269f36ED2E657c61D3F", "created": 1621629914, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ6S2Zk9dUc3V5gFDviKweu4Q4AVXo56MeiTgVAeA2zmB", "voter": "0x504E7620069a0a8354434dED3150ed7E2ECF5153", "created": 1621613229, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmexEW8wwzTC2yLvc3ZQAJGT4W5rkeNVmvTGCZTDE98Zr1", "voter": "0x245Bd6B5D8f494df8256Ae44737A1e5D59769aB4", "created": 1621612493, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZM6fUrPumPEVwsX78YN473sT15kF4xQn2wyWmHAUxsu1", "voter": "0x77E851A926297fff2E6BC8FDbB5bB6087a617eC5", "created": 1621600403, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}]}
