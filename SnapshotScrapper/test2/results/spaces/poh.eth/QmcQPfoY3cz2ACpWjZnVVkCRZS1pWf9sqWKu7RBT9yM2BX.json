Furthermore to lock the decision using the locking mechanism proposed in HIP-10.\n\nAbstract\nThe issuance rate of $UBI is 1 $UBI/hour/person, which seems to be very satisfactory to the community. However, we lack a decision specifying this issuance rate. This proposal formally adopts this issuance rate and bans all other forms of issuance - for instance putting tokens directly into the DAO account. In addition, the decision will be locked using the new HIP-10 mechanism, which will need to pass before this proposal can be put to a final vote. The decision is mostly about sending a signal to ourselves and others that the issuance rate is holy and will not be changed, ever.\n\nMotivation\nA good currency needs dependability - if it operates under rules that are unlikely to change then people will be more likely to trust it. The burning rate question will be left open, but just fixing the issuance rate will already make future supply much easier to predict.\nAnd future problems can be addressed within changing issuance:\n\nIf we need to raise the income, then we but increase the value of the token.\nIf we need money, we but get outside funding or increase revenue.\n\nLocking Motivation\nLocking the decision will send a signal to ourselves and others that $UBI will never be changed. This will deflate arguments against investing time and money in the currency because \u201cthe DAO could just put 3 million in its account at any time.\u201d\n\nSpecification\nThe $UBI token will be issued at a rate of 1 $UBI/hour/human.\nNo other issuance of $UBI will be allowed.\n\nRationale\nThis proposal was split off from HIP-10 as a separate proposal because it had too great an impact on the future of the DAO.", "choices": ["Yes - lock the issuance rate", "No - do not lock"], "start": 1622016000, "end": 1622880000, "snapshot": "12508665", "state": "closed", "author": "0x77E851A926297fff2E6BC8FDbB5bB6087a617eC5", "space": {"id": "poh.eth", "name": "Proof Of Humanity"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdJDwBLTazEmQRUPyqbkf626bTyG7gWMsEGnqFKYkZ9SN", "voter": "0xe724C1D534284f2837F3ab310eF8329BBD7c045E", "created": 1622834022, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY9mQ181JNHvsm8seRifMfh3GDMoQHkywHgCaDkGkkzSV", "voter": "0x17a91203A9E9C3519c2F76210497eF7F4BE2352F", "created": 1622652481, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUTYfYjFqCRfb78vRN91F5UhmtnZQwtkf11AEeLTGmzXC", "voter": "0xE42Dc1a7a817377DA92b6f8e7Dd9b2a6DC806d68", "created": 1622463097, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW8LeRiFhkcE3Aj4PJdBAHTQFGG2XhYw6QNvu15fFnuYB", "voter": "0x5886f65425cad457776d7a89a399907c97e608e5", "created": 1622461183, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXFpU6AosY3KF3AWxENvU6C9ob1E6ubk1EFTaiZj3Jf9Q", "voter": "0x4a9A2F31E2009045950DF5aAb36950609DE93c78", "created": 1622445569, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXNSLRFnyvVovBgSJDuJQ684X2oHX2859xBnAY7cQ2t3p", "voter": "0xb9f6C43FaAe4B3bC0e00C4918C17B86Fc9f84C66", "created": 1622407904, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRFZCJYAgwv9ZfRayhovYuyiRKcEpDX61sZsfz88fTHW4", "voter": "0x6280dc842F55eCCA9B7a7d490F892BD9aDC4Ab17", "created": 1622182254, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSvWEvW37dpvGehiUY2vjJJN3CobdkbFeBpRntoDCNxfc", "voter": "0xf94bfBD175219331f9FF323eA703ebD2a05fD33a", "created": 1622182227, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVf4spqFp1woTicjQQUn3V8n6S4KnDTnVQh2wn4Ne33uB", "voter": "0xC6510245a3d961746DB4883916d2D600e19f4ff3", "created": 1622081635, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTwsmVoxzQ6iqJTLRrAi6U66pAsYs4nZQrnMUVrSfBPqZ", "voter": "0xaF9655eD0b27A2143bd4F099f9f2F1CF3c6DCC6F", "created": 1622080829, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeAJkM5KVkfYuEgFdvT4dJS7YTf5EYryigw5J1P8RmQ2B", "voter": "0x57F908C42F5a0e5DBBd3c35a137cC242cF89Add6", "created": 1622045523, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeQ8xLupNgRe569i8AoFZkHpCuZvSVQYubSFKhTLRTtJz", "voter": "0x77E851A926297fff2E6BC8FDbB5bB6087a617eC5", "created": 1622016791, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "poh.eth"}}]}
