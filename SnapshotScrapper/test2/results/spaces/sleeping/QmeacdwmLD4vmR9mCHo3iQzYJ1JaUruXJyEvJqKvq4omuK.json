We were previously thinking to transfer the ownership to a community owned multi-sig wallet, but among all the people who messaged us for self-nomination, there is only one person who shared his background and future plans for the sleeping.finance, and the rest have not replied us when we asked for more details. Therefore,  we are creating this proposal to vote the ownership transfer to this person only. His name is Oswald, and as many of you who have seen, he has been voluntarily putting a lot of effort in helping answering questions for our community members since day one of our launch. With his dev background and experiences in crypto, we trust that he will make sleeping.finance a successful project in future. \nPlease vote for this ownership transfer if you approve this decision!\n\nHere's an introduction of Oswald:\n\n1. My background is in Computer Science and comes from experience running a PC/Server/GameConsole repair+support business. I got into crypto 2013 after trying to buy a few BTC for $3/BTC by postal mail, not receiving those coins but being fascinated with the price action on this crazy new asset. I got into altcoins and soon learned Python and Perl to work on an IRCbot (polls price and market data and administered the channel) while becoming friends with a couple OG Bittrex developers. My day job took me away from crypto for a couple years and now I am back to crypto programming studying Smart Contract programming (Solidity, React, Web3, nodeJS) and building a trading bot for uniswap. I also have an interest in economics as per Austrian School of Business. I am currently holding the most liquidity on the SLEEP-DAI and SLEEP-USDC pairs, last I checked today. And likely may be close to a top holder if all my staked SLEEP are counted along with what I already withdrew into my wallets. (500k SLEEP and counting)\n2. My expertise lies in reading and writing computer programs so I would be interested in helping with development efforts as a part-time effort (second to my business). Otherwise, I can support the project by moderator work of the Telegram/Discord group(s). At present that is the best of what I can offer but that will likely change as I gain more experience and connections in the crypto realms.\n3. I have an interest in the long term success of this project as that is good for not only me but the community as a whole. I would be an active voter for governance matters and would only support signing multi-sig transactions that were in the best interest of the greater whole. As an example of how I support the projects which I am invested in:\n-I currently hold moderator-supporter status with HOLYheld stake farming (which has their debit card program coming soon after mining program ends) and am invested in them as well. \n-I also (unofficially) support WOJAK farm, GoldMining farm and just recently joined the ONIGIRI development team as a supportive member. \n-If you see any of the telegram chats for those aforementioned farming projects you will often see me there supporting other users, helping with onboarding process (I am a very patient teacher), keeping the conversation on the project and making sure that only accurate information was being transmitted to our respective communities.", "choices": ["Agree", "Disagree"], "start": 1602615600, "end": 1602874800, "snapshot": "11051204", "state": "closed", "author": "0xFD1AbE6F05A17C2dc198F6f56Cb5d85Cc2279Ea9", "space": {"id": "sleeping", "name": "sleep"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVvCgpbUxL5Nv4Th11UaGacag74fbavfR7cg3VNXaP92E", "voter": "0xc24B11b915f53050b83D1da45F6c56096655b7F7", "created": 1602865874, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sleeping"}}, {"id": "QmPvvs5d4ufpjDVKNndAvPFWQdGkjSA1kZpEjV8CchJZPA", "voter": "0x68C295d20E6C272Ce8229489385Ed22C8c62ea80", "created": 1602772803, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sleeping"}}, {"id": "Qmd99YwKLm5NXbyND5fY4omXLvHo77U4UEnxXzBchfpFB7", "voter": "0x1793d9B7ff6C67650828e912bD384EA19600435B", "created": 1602741130, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sleeping"}}, {"id": "QmPBpEKPoYBR17f1XM1AaFx8EGZ7GF4UeA3TjmfeQueAbn", "voter": "0xB344cA21ABaF85F24975B3d1D5Bfdc42DB09f9C4", "created": 1602726398, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sleeping"}}, {"id": "QmeeSzHhaSpv1f9BkiCWZfwuSBXstg2Qt4cBbqTeVnzm4Y", "voter": "0x985D554590F3f73B707259b58ceb5177De89D1E0", "created": 1602680684, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sleeping"}}, {"id": "Qmb7kgYfthTrufEPNscv7bq6UPARN71Sd72AVEV1kSWyU4", "voter": "0x7CD4F840074229A5ad0ef172Aa4A2114A75d0446", "created": 1602680630, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sleeping"}}, {"id": "QmNutbXemss717UJw3cinoWYSWPQH138zgvwpV69EToRmv", "voter": "0x116C53362F7b1c0E3Ecff44AB8379F3F6d993c8d", "created": 1602678596, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sleeping"}}, {"id": "QmYf3RW6CuPtJRanp3H79URyFf71iTnDDRnr31BXYBgCBH", "voter": "0xFD1AbE6F05A17C2dc198F6f56Cb5d85Cc2279Ea9", "created": 1602654415, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sleeping"}}]}
