As many subgraph developers initially signaled ~100K GRT when using the network, the cost of upgrading a subgraph currently sits around 2.5K GRT. This cost is in addition to the opportunity cost of locking up the signal as well as the cost of actually paying for query fees.\n\n## References\n\nEconomic Attack Evaluation:\nThe major constraint of lowering the curation tax was evaluated in Appendix A of GIP-0013, which is referred to as Subgraph Withholding Attack\n\nCommunity Polls:\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/graphprotocol.eth/proposal/QmRz29aE4TXpi9HrNbn6ZA1sRF1xEBeGbw8HxRpHZRZ4rD\n\nAudit:\nThe code that implements the curation tax has already been audited as a part of previous audits. GIP-0013 implements a parameter change in the existing code in the form of a reduction of the curation tax from 2.5% to 1%\n\n\u2014\n\n# Graph Governance Proposal-0006\n\n## Reduce Curation Tax\nThis proposal is to update The Graph's curation tax parameters from 2.5% to 1% as described in Graph Improvement Proposal (GIP) 0013.\n\nThe code deployed that implements GIP-0013 must correspond to the commit hash included in the front matter of this governance proposal.\n\nFollowing a successful \"yes\" vote, the protocol update should be carried out at the earliest convenience using The Graph Council's Gnosis Multisig.\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1633978800, "end": 1634583600, "snapshot": "13399201", "state": "closed", "author": "0x38FA68D1C06BD272893908a74E6BcC67E28d4Da8", "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth", "name": "The Graph Council"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qma9gcBrhAgfPnio5FTC35u95d4xh2zSFBwWwJEkHUunym", "voter": "0x37BC95e38235Ec42F185E945922a4E2C9795B391", "created": 1634222554, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNV4UdqxGrg1CzdW3QShgMGH7Z6pLosF6HSfMVtJ1Vhoc", "voter": "0x38FA68D1C06BD272893908a74E6BcC67E28d4Da8", "created": 1634146492, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcydFxH6HgDniZphJsWdmap5UpqF1msxAcJFEh1meeZkZ", "voter": "0x4530aFEaDe76579f4D4E6fF9e079520B7e7ebA9A", "created": 1634064489, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdwF3WtMoxhWuZCgbNWdEjGn1dng913ZnkbKAyHdRLxUn", "voter": "0xd201C95461F69A031Cdc317f453ff190890722aA", "created": 1634062641, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRHGijENbuQbHvcHTKdnguiic4e5hhq5GCfeyTHEiZz6U", "voter": "0xFe46c8B3a09993D35702a0790B00cAA2bb474dc2", "created": 1634035581, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZGmiwNRU7vqAq9BRNR9HeD3gVoPo6PyomJGmTZg3YE3Y", "voter": "0x7EbE5983FDA73749f94E39A215Cc80263A280385", "created": 1633985882, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRGfSN5tEKjxsnGmwd4s3RRxfrUbSErH98K9rc4jPtccj", "voter": "0xE0FADeFDb233C32C67a1e428951aEfE8dF6ce639", "created": 1633984498, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth"}}]}
