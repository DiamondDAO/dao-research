The motivation and scope of the changes are captured in the language of the proposal itself.\n\nThe code deployed that implements GIP-0003 must correspond to the commit hash included in the front matter of this governance proposal, which corresponds to the version of the implementation that was audited by OpenZeppelin.\n\nFollowing a successful \"yes\" vote, given that the change described in GIP-0003 is backwards compatible, the protocol upgrade should be carried out at the earliest convenience using The Graph Council's Gnosis Multisig.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1619708400, "end": 1620140400, "snapshot": "12336139", "state": "closed", "author": "0x37BC95e38235Ec42F185E945922a4E2C9795B391", "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth", "name": "The Graph Council"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWYR7M6co996huXXjRL9tgWRsf4NgUgGTEHCYX5kFEn5j", "voter": "0xd201C95461F69A031Cdc317f453ff190890722aA", "created": 1619736233, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaYjgPu6vRueas6c5QGLkjmYyhbCStB4u7GVvGbVTMMN6", "voter": "0x38FA68D1C06BD272893908a74E6BcC67E28d4Da8", "created": 1619724849, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPujXLYPZMchWM1crjTdFE19LTY2PYi5yaLkh7k21mFeQ", "voter": "0x4530aFEaDe76579f4D4E6fF9e079520B7e7ebA9A", "created": 1619717570, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVA17N3skY1LKPYvJULMRBXcYF3TDb88J3ajfjaw9MdYR", "voter": "0x47c6c166F462a2886cb45EFeE7FEAf29941ECEb2", "created": 1619712522, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSQnMC3YRDxMs8vemWZsr74p6mumzV2JJc2nJBeHwxWth", "voter": "0x7EbE5983FDA73749f94E39A215Cc80263A280385", "created": 1619710559, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQZ8pf5fE5MA1hiBbWExNui9cADfbP14FtM5WfpMCvXQD", "voter": "0x37BC95e38235Ec42F185E945922a4E2C9795B391", "created": 1619709782, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "council.graphprotocol.eth"}}]}
