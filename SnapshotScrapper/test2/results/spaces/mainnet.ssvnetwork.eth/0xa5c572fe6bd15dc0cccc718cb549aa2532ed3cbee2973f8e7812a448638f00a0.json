To date, we have served as community ambassadors and moderators, answering questions and providing assistance to users on Discord, freeing up the Blox team to focus on driving the project forward. We also perform other essential duties, such as network testing, educational outreach, and marketing efforts. As partners, we will stay committed to these efforts and further utilize our collective talents to serve the project.\n\nThe proposed token purchase is for 89,605 SSV tokens from Batch 1 at a price of $6.19 per token. The partners will be subjected to the terms specified in the [DAO Partnership Proposal](https://forum.ssv.network/t/dao-partner-program/52).\n\n **Motivation**\n\nSSV is a special and rare project. It is not just promising as a business venture or impressive as an engineering innovation. It is a critical and principled piece of the Ethereum ecosystem that is necessary to build a robust, decentralized, and fair staking economy.\n\nStaking is currently plagued with issues and inefficiencies\u2014 unacceptable slashing risks, centralization, custodial requirements, and lack of client diversity. But SSV is a clear and elegant solution to these problems, and it is without any commensurate competitors. Moreover, the team and community that have chosen to develop and support SSV are capable, determined, and kind. For these reasons, through this partnership, we seek to further entrench ourselves into this effort and formally commit to assisting in its growth and success.\n\n **Partner details**\n\n* Greg Foderaro (\u2018fod\u2019) \u2014 Greg is a long-time member of the crypto community as an enthusiast and investor.
