The goal of the DAO should be to completely distribuite the multisig signer committee.\nThe gnosis wallet and its signers are committed to execute DAO decisions as-is with no discretion, by following the DAO guidelines, thus serving merely as administrators to guarantee the safety of the wallet for a limited time. The committee and the DAO strive to add more signers and to replace those temporarily held by Blox, and, when technically feasible, move to a fully automated execution.\n\n**Mechanics**\nA Gnosis safe(wallet) was created at address: 0xb35096b074fdb9bBac63E3AdaE0Bbde512B2E6b6\n[Wallet link](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xb35096b074fdb9bBac63E3AdaE0Bbde512B2E6b6/balances)\n\nInitial multisig committee: \n- Lakshman Sankar (ethereum foundation)\n- Bitfly (creators of beaconcha.in)\n- Preston van loon (co-founder at Prysmatic labs)\n- Thorsten Behrens, a.k.a, Yorick (co-founder at cryptomanufaktur.io)\n- Sam Clarkson (sneaky.vc)\n- Blox (SSV.Network)\n", "choices": ["Yes, make them signers", "No, don't make them signers"], "start": 1631199600, "end": 1631804400, "snapshot": "13190000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9dcbD4eF4886dB706bC442F2d6F9AFA5175FeB63", "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth", "name": "SSV.Network"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmV28DSLjpPfEdTKx9FDBLUCD9Feo4syNCioMrFYRcuV6Q", "voter": "0x477f34514a5785AD3B56dBE6F4737a9218b53019", "created": 1631798938, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUPyYhYEgwu5funWj6fkWkmkT5d4uJHnV1cDhbPgt3Sxc", "voter": "0xBcd05a10235252d20e686194B1063E98D7474611", "created": 1631798845, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmScLgk9GhJ6FHwLo9CpZ4JU4X4X6gyAbhYxQq24rxQZFD", "voter": "0x68A511d3ca7850E5274F55301155cD80929EbD78", "created": 1631798720, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX239urUDNAzofbwovR2pdPnrkohFgewFr8wvei9QEXM8", "voter": "0x9dcbD4eF4886dB706bC442F2d6F9AFA5175FeB63", "created": 1631797311, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRQZj85ZjK72prYtvYmZqEDyzeetoivFsPgegSLjbJisq", "voter": "0xA0879bE36B13F63C92E12448a1A9e8fe32ff8971", "created": 1631797246, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPFBy7aufWFkvjbbmJoK4nrbr7x7Q2dbKmJYohWhjXKKb", "voter": "0x10DA778E1FBC226C8ef2aEB48256539e4117f928", "created": 1631366081, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYQbzrt9N36xQ8rebnjBrbPyttTgUtuoKBUJTrpFwW26u", "voter": "0xD6475C558A7220770b7b63df40ab4716D30584DE", "created": 1631210953, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP232teJ9SA5W5FwnFDCEvsYBfGC12zykofHznTA6iCix", "voter": "0xe1e550357DD309E360b045dE0713b13066efd701", "created": 1631204495, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}]}
