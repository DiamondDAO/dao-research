{"id": "QmeDT1SFkqvo6Auyc7GXa7qgys97UizuiaA8RXe9YW15jG", "title": "Token Upgrade CDT -> SSV", "body": "**Proposal Overview**\nWe propose to enable a voluntary upgrade of the CDT token to a new ERC20 contract, symbol, decimal precision and minting ability.\nThe name of the upgraded token will change to SSV.\n\n**Motivation**\nCDT was developed in 2017 using best practices and latest standardized code by the leading libraries (OpenZeppellin).\nMany innovations, repairs and advancements have been made to said code which should be updated to the current CDT token contract.\n\nAs SSV.Network is a fully decentralised network, governed by a DAO hence making governance decentralised, and is fast approaching its testnet phase (and soon after - mainnet). Therefore, a more suitable token symbol should be selected to represent these changes and to be affiliated with the network.\n\nThe upgraded token shall be used to run the SSV.Network, for its fees, and for governing it, thus mainiting the token\u2019s utility for its holders.\n\n**Mechanics**\nAn open source web UI will be developed in order to facilitate the upgrade.\n\nConcurrently, a new SSV token contract will be deployed to the ethereum mainnet, based on the code in this Github repository. \nThe contract uses OpenZeppelin's trusted and well tested ERC20 contracts.   \nThe SSV contract is fully ERC20 compatible, mintable and ownable by the DAO multisig wallet.\nSSV deployed address: **0x9D65fF81a3c488d585bBfb0Bfe3c7707c7917f54**\n\nTo complete the picture and allow the upgrade, a new TokenUpgrade contract will be deployed with the purpose of facilitating a safe and easy upgrade for existing CDT holders. \nA simple CDT deposit into the TokenUpgrade contract will send SSV tokens back to the sender at the rate of 1:100 (100 CDT = 1 SSV). \nThe DAO will mint 10M SSV tokens to cover token upgrades for all CDT holders (1B CDT in existence).\nThe newly minted SSV tokens will be deposited into the TokenUpgrade contract.\nTokenUpgrade deployed address: **0x2bf73A478cc6a7bA4E6758A3A52AbDc8CDBa735E**", "choices": ["Yes, let's upgrade!", "No, I don't want to upgrade"], "start": 1631199600, "end": 1631804400, "snapshot": "13190000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9dcbD4eF4886dB706bC442F2d6F9AFA5175FeB63", "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth", "name": "SSV.Network"}, "votes": 14, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmd17WEy5TJJ5F6v81ineRcw3HGvSihnyYBDQyjjqPFDBR", "voter": "0x42725A485C4DD073A3C15895C216ACb15872ABB8", "created": 1631804052, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVUpGN2PGfksQP6wJ2rfZXshzjSnUeSoxC3R95rvzqUXr", "voter": "0x150F2c2D199a54AaC8Dbb9959c99EED50BdC4eA1", "created": 1631803026, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTJSXvVfWktTUc6KCsVohsKwnBLo638j5V11Mokdmpqzb", "voter": "0xBcd05a10235252d20e686194B1063E98D7474611", "created": 1631798817, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb72NfM2VB8W7bWrSN85ms6ipikF6mAEo2u4XzuT28FUc", "voter": "0x68A511d3ca7850E5274F55301155cD80929EbD78", "created": 1631798757, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcJe4GJjvgZRv4DBYu1RBGMj65fD1KbVCZPQbavEjTKdH", "voter": "0xA0879bE36B13F63C92E12448a1A9e8fe32ff8971", "created": 1631797849, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSLvSc9UpXwZyA9JdqttymwSo6WQ32xoAnDi18RN3K4F4", "voter": "0x9dcbD4eF4886dB706bC442F2d6F9AFA5175FeB63", "created": 1631797833, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmavLmMnXjgsdBvH6jdUsjizevefRJcYGvoKRyHgTB5nvm", "voter": "0x555B5C5ca817eBF7325e62d38C73c2bD3D988E3c", "created": 1631612715, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP45sUtoDCKy3ADAuzdNVfPZnKC1q2eAU7f1JBB5HHfpS", "voter": "0x2F4462279328F6d0085D87f74f336D0f7D722242", "created": 1631480759, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTWUJp5zP9BGafcUkxSkzPfSBHFRjqwiRaKHPRnSRm2yG", "voter": "0x00000029fF545c86524Ade7cAF132527707948C4", "created": 1631476443, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZMRTTkxwXycPRmz35BAkybLwNcQEZxgx3wMWMb15FKvp", "voter": "0x10DA778E1FBC226C8ef2aEB48256539e4117f928", "created": 1631365945, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYwd1iH7PgTDjnnWWKmMgFB46YSvyBQsZS8rX26WqDWgK", "voter": "0x07c2af75788814BA7e5225b2F5c951eD161cB589", "created": 1631258262, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf43kh6jhwzeB774utWxrMXRct3ZGGW3Fgaa25bJzTCFn", "voter": "0xD6475C558A7220770b7b63df40ab4716D30584DE", "created": 1631210794, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeNsvLqcKxE7Qzgi9hugyuZGnoJpsYT9DTtrP5HL6xrjX", "voter": "0xe1e550357DD309E360b045dE0713b13066efd701", "created": 1631204456, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNPtrqrdXnCeVbAHPa3WLXCccDNEo5zBqXsJEyMYpTwv2", "voter": "0xeb2693537f1306f5A3820BD98a1A4580c60Aa410", "created": 1631199747, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth"}}]}
