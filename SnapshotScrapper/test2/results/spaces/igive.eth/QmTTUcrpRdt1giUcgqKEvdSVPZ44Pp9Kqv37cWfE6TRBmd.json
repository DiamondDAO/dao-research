", "body": "Since we're working to build out cross chain integration for BCharity platforms, we've run into some issues that we'd like to rectify immediately before moving forward with any new launches.  If we want to build our own native layered EVM blockchain, and provide the intended utility for GIVE to be that scalable native, we need to launch an ETH main net token, and then reissue/launch POD (proof of donation) versions of GIVE to live on the non native chain.  We also need a DAO governance token, so we'd like to launch the iGIVE token and GIVE token IDO on mainnet.  In short, in order to achieve better cross chain compatibility, we need our token contract addresses to be fluid across all chains.  This measure will enable us to tap into oracles and keep prices fairly stable across multiple chains.   Ideally, we'd like for everyone to farm on every chain, but we all have our own bags and preferences.  \n\nGIVE hard capped supply at 21 billion (for future utility purposes, we would benefit having a larger total supply for the native chain in order to keep fees in check and prevent major run-ups and manipulation of the price by whales.   IDO 21 Million GIVE tokens - @ .10.  and 2.1 million iGIVE @ $1.   The funds raised through this IDO will go directly towards making sure the token is properly listed, and plenty of liquidity is held in place to allow for the market to flow as intended.  All additional funds will go towards marketing.  Of course we'd like to launch a new website/dapp to handle the IDO, and become the centralized project website that can link you to the various farms and platforms.  \nHaving an ETH main net token and a basic build on main net is crucial if we want to be able to easily port and integrate into all future coming chains, and build our own.
