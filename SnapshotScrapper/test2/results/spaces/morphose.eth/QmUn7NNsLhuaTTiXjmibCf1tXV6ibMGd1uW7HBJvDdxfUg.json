Basically, make protocol free for MORPH holders.\n\nThis addition should potentially make people use the protocol more and buy/hold MORPH tokens to keep coming back for using again. \n\nSince it's for 1 BNB or more and fee is low as 0.0075 BNB for 1 BNB, buy-pressure on token should potentially be more than the sell-pressure of rewards.
