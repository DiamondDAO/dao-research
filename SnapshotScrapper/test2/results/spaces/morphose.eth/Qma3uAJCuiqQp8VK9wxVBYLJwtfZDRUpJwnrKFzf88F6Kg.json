{"id": "Qma3uAJCuiqQp8VK9wxVBYLJwtfZDRUpJwnrKFzf88F6Kg", "title": "Launch On Polygon with xMORPH token", "body": "We use covalent API which supports more than 9 popular EVM Blockchains. We can launch to any of them tomorrow. We also have to launch on TRON to support TRC-20 USDT and several other important blockchains such Solana, Cardano and Polkadot. Technically, it is hard and time consuming to create a bridge to move MORPH to every blockchain. This effort has to be put in making MORPH a privacy token.\n\nWe support multiple tokens that some are used rarely for privacy (CAKE). In down markets and off season protocol usage decreases largely. However the mixer has to reply to privacy user demand in any case so we have to reward people for depositing to get more deposits. Since users have to combine native tokens in deposits, we have to offer high APRS as well. MORPH with 100K supply is not suitable for this, in every Blockchain.\n\nWe cannot even create liquidity to put MOPRH in our native PancakeSwap v2, how are we going to create liquidity to put MORPH on QuickSwap? When we (community) sell tokens for a reason to make project better, holders sell 5 times more decreasing the token price. This mostly effects the ad money we spend, so the new users, deposits and token price. We can't do adverts because we don't get the investment we put back because of these sell-offs. We could never learn to act in coordination as a community, and many times proven that we won't. Liquidity that protocol needs cannot be created by selling MORPH.\n\nFor the 3 reasons above I propose launching on Polygon (and other blockchains) with xMORPH reward token with a small presale to create the liquidity we need for development and marketing. \n ", "choices": ["Yes Let's Do It", "No Let's Not Do It"], "start": 1624957200, "end": 1625083200, "snapshot": "8714201", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3e4Ff40a827d4Ede5336Fd49fBCbfe02c6530375", "space": {"id": "morphose.eth", "name": "Morphose"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmS6uS1uWzfYmwkSUa7uWg9ZGNTWpVnm1RrSaKeL1v8H7L", "voter": "0xb76D7948b1fF9aE3d6Bf117B1430a06078a05b74", "created": 1624957757, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "morphose.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY93ytDeR7ASRPh4beYsBxx1aQcwUkY3x96VGjo36Yb58", "voter": "0x638Ac2286d667353ED8740Ab4532D90a71E6bf14", "created": 1624957720, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "morphose.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQs1ErCkQY5mvg8RHDbbRXgvcyRHHAFe2stfc5rUmXgCV", "voter": "0x3e4Ff40a827d4Ede5336Fd49fBCbfe02c6530375", "created": 1624957485, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "morphose.eth"}}]}
