After every transaction, 0.3% of this commission will be used to automatically buy back MORPH from its BNB-MORPH PancakeSwap pool. Bought MORPH will be collected in LP Fund to be used as liquidity in PancakeSwap and other pools/exchanges. The rest (0.6%) will be sent to the Fees Collected Fund to combine with MORPH tokens in LP Fund to support liquidity. \n\nStaking applied this way will increase the deposit traffic and TVL of the protocol directly improving the anonymity of the private transactions. It will also put constant buying pressure on the MORPH token to equalize the selling pressure of using it for rewards. Since the MORPH token has a limited supply of 100K (compared to 5M-10M supply of Tornado.cash clones), tokens in the LP fund won\u2019t be burned but will be sold to new holders to add up positively to the equalizing effect of the reward-buyback cycle (to increase MORPH token value).", "choices": ["Accept", "Reject"], "start": 1618218000, "end": 1618563600, "snapshot": "6538738", "state": "closed", "author": "0x0D0C4edC0c1d9C2D5f6Eb20d3B0F75FCDdB1962B", "space": {"id": "morphose.eth", "name": "Morphose"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNgceHwvCVFqcog27ZdACjm5GWj7M6aNKm5q1HSDnmpZx", "voter": "0x0D0C4edC0c1d9C2D5f6Eb20d3B0F75FCDdB1962B", "created": 1618517514, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "morphose.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR5s1bH5gxBzWWRvJX9sUijtCTgbYkfv9j9D1VTgxouMW", "voter": "0x0675c4F001521c4F6564d446A28fE77110F9d125", "created": 1618517404, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "morphose.eth"}}]}
