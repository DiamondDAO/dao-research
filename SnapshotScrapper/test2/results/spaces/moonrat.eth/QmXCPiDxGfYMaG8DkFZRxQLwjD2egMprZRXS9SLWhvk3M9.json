Requires review by the community.", "body": "To all ratgang members,\nThis proposal might not be seen as a complete proposal. It is more or less an alternative to the previous staking proposal (using all 570 BNB for Cake staking) with an additional element (see proposal 2). It requires the combined ratgang brain power to fine-tune, that is if the team decides it wants to go down that road.\nThe reason I came to moonrat was that the aim was to develop the super Defi app. Additionally, there is a huge market for people who don\u2019t own or won\u2019t buy crypto as it is still too complicated. We should tap this market by establishing a fund \u2013 the moonrat global crypto fund. But we need revenue to pay for marketing, developing the swap and the super Defi app. Games are also an option but need far more work and new development than concentrating on what Moonrat set out to do from the start.\nThe previous staking proposal (using all 570 BNB) sounds rather risky with a 100% allocation to Cake. We all know what happens if you eat too much of it \ud83d\ude09. Hence I\u2019m proposing an actively managed fund (like a trust fund) that the team oversees and adjusts according to the market conditions. If the market runs well, allocate more to riskier assets, if it\u2019s in downturn then allocate more to stable coins. This fund then feeds into rewards, buy-backs, development (of any kind) and marketing.\nRevenue is obviously a problem with the current system and I wrote up two mutually non-exclusive proposals how to generate just that. This should in turn be used in certain fractions for development, to stock up the rewards/buy-backs, build partnerships and maybe as venture capital.\nProposal 1 \nFor normal/bull market:\nEven here it's important to spread the risk. Below are examples.\n1.\tAllocate 25-50% to USDX, a stable coin on Kavaswap, which gives a whopping 85-100% APY. If this decreases over time, we can shop around for other stable assets or LP pools for stable enough coins. This then needs to be further sub-divided to spread the risk.\n2.\tAllocate up to 15-25% to Cake, which can be staked with 80% APY. It\u2019s established and considered a safer platform but prices still fluctuate dramatically at times so this needs looking after.\n3.\tPick 5-10 small, high yield assets using yield aggregators like Autofarm or Beefy.finance with up to 5% allocation each but no more than 25% of the total we have at our disposal.\nExamples\ni.\tWEX 150% APY\nii.\tBanana 150% APY\niii.\tSwamp 200+% APY\niv.\tWings 200% APY\nv.\tNuts 160% APY\nvi.\tKebab 150% APY\nvii.\txBLZD 240% APY\nviii.\tany other high yield assets\nix. 5% accumulation of good projects or partnership projects\n\nThere are new assets coming out all the time so this space needs active management. If the market changes and a new bear market begins we should consider putting 75-100% in stable coins. USDX is a good option for high yield.\n\nFor bear markets:\nAllocate all holdings to high yield stable coins.\na.\t50% into USDX which still pays 85-100% APY (but as more adoption of kava happens this will decrease)\nb.\t15-25% Liquidity provision for USDC-USDT pools which do pay out over 10%\nc.\t15-25% Liquidity of ETH-BTC pools\nd.\tUp to 10% Cake\ne.\t10% vault for accumulation of \u2018cheap\u2019 coins with good prospective growth or projects we want to partner up with.\n\nThen we need to decide what to do with the yield from those coins. I do not believe putting all to rewards is wise, after all we want the staking pool to thrive and increase. An increase here will automatically lead to more rewards and growth. This can be adjusted using a vote later on. Here is an example which still needs working on:\n1.\t20-30% rewards pool (i.e. instant conversion) or buy-back (which also feeds the rewards and LP)\n2.\t25-50% compounding (that is more staking)\n3.\t25-50% development (e.g. the super Dapp, gaming), that is conversion into stable coins which can be used to pay developers\n\nProposal 2:\nLP generation can be used as a good source of revenue. We don\u2019t necessarily need 2500+ BNB in the liquidity pool. Yes, it looks good but so far hasn\u2019t helped the price and development. This needs to be transparent, however, so that investors can \u2018follow the money\u2019 if they wish to.\n\nSet a range for the LP pool and a threshold (e.g. 1500 BNB) above which the LP can be drained periodically (e.g. if 50-100 BNB above the threshold was generated) and used for:\na.\t20% rewards or buy-back\nb.\t30-50% go into the project staking pool, which follows the guidelines decided with the community (see proposal 1)\nc.\tRest goes into further development\n\nThis is a work-in-progress proposal that would benefit from active, constructive discussion over a reasonable time frame.
