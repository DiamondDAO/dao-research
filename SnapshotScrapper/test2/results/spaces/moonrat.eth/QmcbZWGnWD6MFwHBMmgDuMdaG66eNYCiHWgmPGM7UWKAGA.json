{"id": "QmcbZWGnWD6MFwHBMmgDuMdaG66eNYCiHWgmPGM7UWKAGA", "title": "Why are there no basic rules to vote?", "body": "Actual, it is possible, and according to the rules fully legitimate, to create a proposal with a 1 minute voting window. The only rule right now is: If an idea is stupid (who decides this?) and/or impossible to implement, it will be ignored. \nAlso, there are no minimum requirements in case of \"popular vote\" (number of wallets) and \"value vote\" (number of tokens). \n\nWith this proposal, I intend to include some rules and limits to the votes. This, to protect the project and token from votes like the two with only a 1 minute vote window and just one vote. The numbers are as I get up with the rules in writing. There is no meaning or hierarchy within\n\n1.) The proposal needs to be possible to implement. Impossible proposals like 30% burn, when there are no tokens left for burning by the Dev and contract has been renounced, are automatically discarded\n2.) There are no stupid ideas. If you don't agree, just vote no. \n3.) Every proposal on this plattform is official and legit. It doesn't matter if a proposal gets promoted on social media or not.\n4.) At least XX% of the number of SMRAT Holding wallets, at the time of opening the proposals,, must have voted until the end of the of the vote. If this target isn't reached, the proposal is automatically discarded. This is some sort of popular vote\n5.) At least XX% of the total token supply must have voted (biggest Whale has 4.1% at the time of writing. Just as comparison). If this target isn't reached, the proposal is automatically discarded. This is some sort of value vote.\n6.) This numbers of 3 and 4 have to be visible in the proposal\n7.) Each vote must have a \"No\" option (Similar words like Disagree etc. are cool too)\n8.) De default duration of a vote is N Weeks. All votes with a shorter duration are invalid and will be discarded. Longer timeframes are possible.\n9.) It has to be ensured, that everyone who takes a vote knows this rules.\n\nThe percentages and duration need to be determined by the community. I don't want to fix them with this Proposal. For this, a second vote is held, if this proposal passes.", "choices": ["Agree, basic rules are needed", "Discagree, no basic rules needed"], "start": 1621008000, "end": 1622217540, "snapshot": "7406510", "state": "closed", "author": "0x745404aA1260AFcA1A0C42140c0a2463F8D4fEd2", "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth", "name": "moonrat.finance"}, "votes": 17, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUuT5CsXVbdwdkFKPSs3ZchQPpRbiTf6N1A2aZ3iNnx5w", "voter": "0xf0EA89FdC3561aaE46A4ACDaA22adF14c7B98b7C", "created": 1621768165, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma3kXWj4fy2j3Q86WLiD6TnuPXa5JGN1e6ojfTMmiJd67", "voter": "0x80f84b9cE4b4d2e063c323b1f557E8c2F3A1A706", "created": 1621621330, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUYi2pyGckb2QyZoc5ad2fcQ2N9ewHawAZCfWPg11w31p", "voter": "0xfC6469527B3EB1366177eE8436653A837996c6fB", "created": 1621607398, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXkgRppSZe6cXfPD3gZLi9Jbqw4ZH6bh7Es5Ui3L7sLks", "voter": "0xE508A6Ae42D3Cc97a86dCE748e496E300360702a", "created": 1621607106, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVbvJnpSGrj7ocPzXBUdWvMPuDigRQGkZBVWmYVsUu4wg", "voter": "0xe67939628520B1ca45bF312D4F74C9A93116bE5b", "created": 1621361869, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTB9BHrXG6xa9snrimpbffGK472LmKHMmRiQRV2NxqWzy", "voter": "0x85431c78fe5e5b0f2135Ec2D994437A2B16f9d17", "created": 1621344113, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVdZdnePwScMUgnB85dsFpf3jjhybin5LAE85FjAtdmkM", "voter": "0x9724CBd94C5Fa9d2fB4e3836c0a143c7333c003B", "created": 1621332630, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQMEyxEGgKuqEkuDiFKY7PaQZrjzosbxFcvxvPvXdwdMN", "voter": "0x0Bb015cE8A78dDD98dfB882e56A408091F902Cb6", "created": 1621323639, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcRrc6VD7M2B15nrg7RyMGK3e8bZvHFc1THvct11HuPBX", "voter": "0x017fF21c6477702af17180E5C03e083e2331Ac73", "created": 1621218993, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZqAkmvmR1EU6hLJMuaUuuRDN3enhZoQfoH8a79A2iFJZ", "voter": "0x377e830d5Fc3955B7755ebC6994894A23948ea57", "created": 1621213437, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYkw2qGDof1umMwQTpTVJiWvvESBB7ntx1GW7CbJEp4fj", "voter": "0x60EC0DE3312fF19Aa728B6Eb01690A99b3239A5c", "created": 1621089753, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQWqwdRUwVeN51oDzhCqkNPQAnrheMLCsYF6HhGDfx7Ln", "voter": "0xc7F35530ecd884895eC225C2f2f63c2fC367a926", "created": 1621078241, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma1nZqiz8RCZz8hcfqktQiCM6Ho8eVkgW5Mhqgmb3Arhy", "voter": "0x1934ae94568ccA26760967734AEDDDb94057ec28", "created": 1621078202, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTo2fHhWU7YyPXjZ37kFks7qxxXd5qnYBM63N6RCLhssR", "voter": "0xca4BF72AE1b9C050729931e715Bd6653df951848", "created": 1621061836, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYRqG9HM7jvRuRANTB7eyhymHAwqbiHzKzfT5dZeyPbzR", "voter": "0x860e1Edbf5C3a23Ab2015cF54BE796f182e79A84", "created": 1621041247, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeNXtrh5cpDYHLo97i173n25fpCjbces2TDcz52o6WMNb", "voter": "0xB0268fAeDd7868A43741A583fe41Eaca3bf2A42C", "created": 1621017221, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNwzdJ5WfFZ1eX1nEuSB63FN115WxSe7TApEqf43TkAAb", "voter": "0x745404aA1260AFcA1A0C42140c0a2463F8D4fEd2", "created": 1621008215, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}]}
