Also some investors may need tos ell and buy again in order to mine MRX. BUT with the delay increase when he buy back the token he may change his mind and do not proceed with these transactions.\n\nExample:\n\nA user buys EBUSD on 15/08/2021 and waits for his weekly reward to claim on 15/09/2021 and then every week. If he sells his coins and buy again this date will reset and increase very much so then he will have to wait a long time in order to start claiming again..\n\nProposition:\nI believe that a solution could be to not reset his cycles of claiming and add more time only if he buy back amount higher than the one he used to hold before selling. \n\nSo in this case user mentioned above who waits for his reward on 15/09/2021 if he sells his token and buy back to mine MRX then his reward will be still available on 15/09/2021 and will be calculated based on the new amount which if it is higher than the amount he had before then he will have same delay only based on the additional amount than the amount he had before.\n\nThe most important of this post is to understand the problem ann what it causes to traders. The proposition could be changed with some other the team could find as solution.", "choices": ["I agree claim delay kill trading", "It is fine as it is now leave it"], "start": 1630576800, "end": 1630918800, "snapshot": "10561547", "state": "closed", "author": "0x160D3CE5a50973Ba50ca19e43505A1457CBF4fd4", "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth", "name": "moonrat.finance"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRuuHtSPpEScc8zVR6cVgKgTbmtzcLoc61a7bUW4ELJvo", "voter": "0x160D3CE5a50973Ba50ca19e43505A1457CBF4fd4", "created": 1630579028, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "moonrat.eth"}}]}
