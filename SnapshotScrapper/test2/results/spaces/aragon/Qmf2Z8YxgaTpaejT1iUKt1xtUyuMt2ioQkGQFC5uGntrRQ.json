{"id": "Qmf2Z8YxgaTpaejT1iUKt1xtUyuMt2ioQkGQFC5uGntrRQ", "title": "Merge ANJ with ANT: 0.0175 ANT/ANJ (no lock)", "body": "## Summary\nIf approved by ANT holders, this proposal will result in an offer to ANJ holders to perform a one-way conversion of ANJ to ANT at a rate of 0.0175 ANT per 1 ANJ with no lock requirement.\n\n## Motivation\nThe recent discussions have demonstrated the strength of the $ANJ community and its conviction in the Aragon Court thesis. While $ANT holders ultimately have governance power over the Court, we think it\u2019s important to at least understand $ANJ holders\u2019 views and use these to inform $ANT voting. From our perspective, the worst case outcome for both sides is a contentious $ANJ \u201cfork\u201d in which the community is split and Aragon Protocol now has a competitor with the same name (Aragon Court Classic?). Avoiding this outcome is crucial and, our research indicates, easily achievable.\n\nWe think $ANJ jurors who remain committed to the Court vision post merger are more valuable and are worth paying a higher premium to provide they convincingly signal this commitment. Projects such as Synthetix have exemplified the positive effects that locking up users can have on a community and on bootstrapping a supply-side and we feel there are lessons to be learned here. $ANJ holders who want to exit the system should still be allowed to do so and compensated for the upside they\u2019re giving up, but this should entail a much lower premium.\n\n## Specification\n- New ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.0175 ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders who take the one-way conversion offer and DO NOT lock and activate the ANT they receive.\n\n## Discussion\n[https://forum.aragon.org/t/proposal-next-steps-for-anj-holders/2478](https://forum.aragon.org/t/proposal-next-steps-for-anj-holders/2478)\n", "choices": ["No", "Yes"], "start": 1606147200, "end": 1606320000, "snapshot": "11315445", "state": "closed", "author": "0xA1d4C9e0a46068AfA3D8424B0618218Bf85ccaAA", "space": {"id": "aragon", "name": "Aragon"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPW1H4VYWvaQ61TWwwDobnAWV9chGw5VjGiXghpVbEiBb", "voter": "0x1710C1Cc43eaa38A7174d196fb319B514C8Ce1Fe", "created": 1606286510, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmfKwPGrZgE5QohDFMLCHeG9pbpW7MHNxv6W9XCthnzCd7", "voter": "0x95715f56D9fAf221a848CA6dA11BC603C53DC95E", "created": 1606244735, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmNi42xUKkkTkcBWCHNcs4qKtpmv7LTpTDX1gLd2qzEyZN", "voter": "0x5ba064c2024FAa0cD962a2CE19E80ab8aEaCed73", "created": 1606238339, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmQCoUtVjm5RMzrUvhL7KthBsa9YJ9C79TAiR7hbWK8Afs", "voter": "0x1a3e98369a9e935d5E807514Fd479Ebf075863c6", "created": 1606204207, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmVDJJg8gNubQwzMxXaX5c3TtgE7HAQpK9EXvxsfBGQHqo", "voter": "0xF5f08Ba7F46e2a86b5ef3BFD56c2097C9f4276D7", "created": 1606191686, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmQ8kPZyHPXCynwVSERrWZxTNeUp6WgtFmSVCdccrC3KLA", "voter": "0xa4C539368A1A3cd94F9e834Ededb8E1dB841e67D", "created": 1606183736, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmZv6mzv8BWqgyVJD9ujhhVBVzGYsQGgkrrmqCF8SSCbud", "voter": "0x197A78Fe1bD3BBb64c1325c027bdE8F67Bac1770", "created": 1606182491, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmfFt9fqtmd7Xp52FHmeTABPSNSX2QBXcfEFw5i7eA7QGc", "voter": "0x11B1785D9Ac81480c03210e89F1508c8c115888E", "created": 1606170812, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmQ4c5xghfMB4Pmk383qGPvEq1GkBaEBdNPujXot2MJbJq", "voter": "0xb3E951D799269F96F82175D04CCe4fC6D867E1E8", "created": 1606166760, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmWzwEay9rapxN18oeJMPAj5ct2ETV6NjLu7fBy8RZ9dym", "voter": "0xa08D4Ca03aa7E83785D6Eaf386F0b2ddBefcB482", "created": 1606163347, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmNQCFQWBKC4pWDASuFE8Yg2pfg29av3YfqziRECH2RdwS", "voter": "0x9990f00DD8167b83256A3159B2188DB4Bfe59116", "created": 1606157360, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "Qmb6rvBGWFeWqz7pKP1hd8myks7JAZZtrQ7ZVu4ULQEebs", "voter": "0xdD36C6C74abd4feF4EbCFB42D4622435D5f2c5f0", "created": 1606150899, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmVEbhGHc4y1ftXi1g8e45iaxDUXGYnoz8A5TNXGgsHxTE", "voter": "0x1a9cEe6E1D21c3C09FB83A980EA54299f01920cd", "created": 1606150056, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}]}
