{"id": "QmcYJrPQPHmvy6ax25gv5yYaiBTi6kg95eNbEoyr1W1ZJC", "title": "Merge ANJ with ANT: 0.015 ANT/ANJ (no lock)", "body": "## Summary\nIf approved by ANT holders, this proposal will result in an offer to ANJ holders to perform a one-way conversion of ANJ to ANT at a rate of 0.015 ANT per 1 ANJ with no lock requirement.\n\n## Motivation\nThe recent discussions have demonstrated the strength of the $ANJ community and its conviction in the Aragon Court thesis. While $ANT holders ultimately have governance power over the Court, we think it\u2019s important to at least understand $ANJ holders\u2019 views and use these to inform $ANT voting. From our perspective, the worst case outcome for both sides is a contentious $ANJ \u201cfork\u201d in which the community is split and Aragon Protocol now has a competitor with the same name (Aragon Court Classic?). Avoiding this outcome is crucial and, our research indicates, easily achievable.\n\nWe think $ANJ jurors who remain committed to the Court vision post merger are more valuable and are worth paying a higher premium to provide they convincingly signal this commitment. Projects such as Synthetix have exemplified the positive effects that locking up users can have on a community and on bootstrapping a supply-side and we feel there are lessons to be learned here. $ANJ holders who want to exit the system should still be allowed to do so and compensated for the upside they\u2019re giving up, but this should entail a much lower premium.\n\n## Specification\n- New ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.015 ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders who take the one-way conversion offer and DO NOT lock and activate the ANT they receive.\n\n## Discussion\n[https://forum.aragon.org/t/proposal-next-steps-for-anj-holders/2478](https://forum.aragon.org/t/proposal-next-steps-for-anj-holders/2478)\n\n", "choices": ["No", "Yes"], "start": 1606147200, "end": 1606320000, "snapshot": "11315445", "state": "closed", "author": "0xA1d4C9e0a46068AfA3D8424B0618218Bf85ccaAA", "space": {"id": "aragon", "name": "Aragon"}, "votes": 15, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZVamUZihH1e2CstzznMMKm7gdayyUYWq5bGfvKth63Fc", "voter": "0x1710C1Cc43eaa38A7174d196fb319B514C8Ce1Fe", "created": 1606286440, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmZrKCeakCd1HEDz2h2NoiFYmoU2uv8chUQKAU9FYd3DWM", "voter": "0x9b6a30F55d74b5d08D1816F37C89FF050a2770c2", "created": 1606255558, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmPuAH9Ch3oP7cTKoLNeLQKnkjPYfdkLcqLh9ixTW9NU2m", "voter": "0x95715f56D9fAf221a848CA6dA11BC603C53DC95E", "created": 1606244713, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmbiapqFU7ij3P32S3n7wVoKcEc8LK3SVipBL6CpdsVt7n", "voter": "0x5ba064c2024FAa0cD962a2CE19E80ab8aEaCed73", "created": 1606238370, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmXQKTDG8pL2Z7rdrC62UL4kPbQFbVjXiMiyCrD9kTYv7h", "voter": "0xBe627296de041f628ef67e744563DB9822e72d20", "created": 1606225317, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmfKjTK2R2CSKipi5oghMWFzVe2KRSVt421dVeGG1jkXua", "voter": "0x1a3e98369a9e935d5E807514Fd479Ebf075863c6", "created": 1606204264, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmdaGeAjNBmXdKMSKAQxBQJBCjB2twY6MbPxishg3K882E", "voter": "0xF5f08Ba7F46e2a86b5ef3BFD56c2097C9f4276D7", "created": 1606191642, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmX2ngz7yhbR8Jj7z8xsPkgfQ5GmvJMaYdWLhxSZMyzwpk", "voter": "0xa4C539368A1A3cd94F9e834Ededb8E1dB841e67D", "created": 1606183820, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmTiW77KxUe75hgQQgS1UpxZysF1VZWj5nHtYZEbLnySyQ", "voter": "0x197A78Fe1bD3BBb64c1325c027bdE8F67Bac1770", "created": 1606182435, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmNS5eatyKiBoA9Njr4T66ZKnBY6jy7HeuXg1BQPbeLXBY", "voter": "0x11B1785D9Ac81480c03210e89F1508c8c115888E", "created": 1606170834, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmRB177PBoo5ak5aWjW22dRHdVWvcUDj1KCqcTdKWRgii3", "voter": "0xb3E951D799269F96F82175D04CCe4fC6D867E1E8", "created": 1606166822, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmaceCQafPbzM5LseWhWE6xSQfYgxVyWJiGkQKMRKC2QUk", "voter": "0xa08D4Ca03aa7E83785D6Eaf386F0b2ddBefcB482", "created": 1606163230, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "Qmdb6TxVjGxMpkkoLNuf9kxSrrw7UCtr9CusnnBcaH1fnq", "voter": "0x808A023B72260170c95d831F589A1ae0DCa1e43E", "created": 1606162334, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmXhWiafbSxqkhN3A1dBHcNAWecsrsDM8155xvCz42QzTr", "voter": "0x9990f00DD8167b83256A3159B2188DB4Bfe59116", "created": 1606157311, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmStAQRukZZxFhDL3Vkys3XiTXtGZut29gXyGjKvLCmAAt", "voter": "0xdD36C6C74abd4feF4EbCFB42D4622435D5f2c5f0", "created": 1606150872, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}]}
