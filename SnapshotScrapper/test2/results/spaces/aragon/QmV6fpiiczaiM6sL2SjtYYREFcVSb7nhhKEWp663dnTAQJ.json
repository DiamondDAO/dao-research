{"id": "QmV6fpiiczaiM6sL2SjtYYREFcVSb7nhhKEWp663dnTAQJ", "title": "Merge ANJ with ANT: 0.0396 ANT/ANJ Proposal", "body": "## Summary \n\nIf approved by ANT holders, this proposal will result in an offer to ANJ holders to perform a one-way conversion of ANJ to ANT at a rate of 0.0396 ANT per 1 ANJ. To take advantage of this offer, ANJ holders must commit to locking and activating the ANT they receive in Aragon Protocol for a period of one year.\n\n## Motivation \n\nThe recent discussions have demonstrated the strength of the $ANJ community and its conviction in the Aragon Court thesis. While $ANT holders ultimately have governance power over the Court, we think it\u2019s important to at least understand $ANJ holders\u2019 views and use these to inform $ANT voting. From our perspective, the worst case outcome for both sides is a contentious $ANJ \u201cfork\u201d in which the community is split and Aragon Protocol now has a competitor with the same name (Aragon Court Classic?). Avoiding this outcome is crucial and, our research indicates, easily achievable.\n\nWe think $ANJ jurors who remain committed to the Court vision post merger are more valuable and are worth paying a higher premium to provide they convincingly signal this commitment. Projects such as Synthetix have exemplified the positive effects that locking up users can have on a community and on bootstrapping a supply-side and we feel there are lessons to be learned here. $ANJ holders who want to exit the system should still be allowed to do so and compensated for the upside they\u2019re giving up, but this should entail a much lower premium.\n\n\nAs such, we seek to give $ANJ holders a chance to express their views and signal what premium they would require in order to convert and lock up their $ANJ to $ANT for 12 months. Our goal is to avoid a splintered community and keep as much as possible of the $ANJ community as part of the future of $ANT.\n\n## Specification\n\n- New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of  0.0396ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders who take the one-way conversion offer and lock the ANT they receive and activate it in Aragon Protocol for a period of 12 months.\n\n- The Aragon Association will schedule a follow-up vote by $ANT holders on Monday November 23, 2020 lasting 48 hours to decide what conversion rate $ANJ holders who take the conversion offer but do not lock and activate their $ANT will receive. There will be three options, each option put to a separate vote with \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d as the response. The option that gets the most \u201cYes\u201d votes AND has more \u201cYes\u201d than \u201cNo\u201d votes will win. A tie will be broken by a vote of the Aragon Association Board of Directors + one advisor. The options that will be put to a vote are:\n  - New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.015ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders to convert their $ANJ to $ANT with no lock + activation requirement.\n  - New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.0175ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders to convert their $ANJ to $ANT with no lock + activation requirement.\n  - New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.02ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders to convert their $ANJ to $ANT with no lock + activation requirement.\n\n## ANJ poll results\n[https://snapshot.page/#/anj/all](https://snapshot.page/#/anj/all)\n\n## Discussion\n\n[https://forum.aragon.org/t/proposal-next-steps-for-anj-holders/2478](https://forum.aragon.org/t/proposal-next-steps-for-anj-holders/2478)\n", "choices": ["No", "Yes"], "start": 1605715200, "end": 1605888000, "snapshot": "11282870", "state": "closed", "author": "0xA1d4C9e0a46068AfA3D8424B0618218Bf85ccaAA", "space": {"id": "aragon", "name": "Aragon"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQHxJCJQAcA6snW7d5W1DBLocsmxgKy89F1UFyo9Jyn4K", "voter": "0xe3534F90E367F5bd62AF306d9F36804a82ba6cAc", "created": 1605883545, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmTx1W8VTyQEwRnWLLbYpWWahmDpPkJdDBuNnDjwKb2szY", "voter": "0x4C632beE45E771Beb190B821bb7aa9f2c3D152ba", "created": 1605805866, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmWffKUPdYNvy9cd59zz64iiwh2yAAgaGS9ec5rrwHv4s7", "voter": "0x6405127E97C3c9D0FB49a48a3332F82581a1EE03", "created": 1605782581, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "Qmaz5CTvmfd7nLAyE9KbpM72VmaLfEi1rzJFpAgRf3U3QR", "voter": "0x1a3e98369a9e935d5E807514Fd479Ebf075863c6", "created": 1605772879, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmPe9yr5fkTPRmDjV4dWoDu8amERufZsBEwDzE6Qi7oGzB", "voter": "0xa4C539368A1A3cd94F9e834Ededb8E1dB841e67D", "created": 1605761792, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmUSQiWS21pJJ6Q212nXKTSYm36Aq5zC4NmyeWyURQXADw", "voter": "0x98A729d4F94111ac21Df906fCdA107DcbC65d0B7", "created": 1605751219, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "Qmanb1RT7411Gi3u7GKDzof3rbKQDyC5cshzWUb3XVx6Fk", "voter": "0xdD36C6C74abd4feF4EbCFB42D4622435D5f2c5f0", "created": 1605741176, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmaCz8zGv9zVHwg1uy8kP7h3CQianLpSNPppBdAr8piawM", "voter": "0x37Bf78fA8853CEE7df39280e70e38f3e163E44c4", "created": 1605721850, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmQupdhb1CoocRpfx2JfYakuRiRC5S8CssZbZ435Nhcq78", "voter": "0x1a9cEe6E1D21c3C09FB83A980EA54299f01920cd", "created": 1605720395, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}]}
