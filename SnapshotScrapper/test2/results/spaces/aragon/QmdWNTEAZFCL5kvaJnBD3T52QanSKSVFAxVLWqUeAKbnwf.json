{"id": "QmdWNTEAZFCL5kvaJnBD3T52QanSKSVFAxVLWqUeAKbnwf", "title": "Merge ANJ with ANT: 0.02 ANT/ANJ Proposal", "body": "## Summary\n\nIf approved by ANT holders, this proposal will result in an offer to ANJ holders to perform a one-way conversion of ANJ to ANT at a rate of 0.02 ANT per 1 ANJ. To take advantage of this offer, ANJ holders must commit to locking and activating the ANT they receive in Aragon Protocol for a period of one year.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe recent discussions have demonstrated the strength of the $ANJ community and its conviction in the Aragon Court thesis. While $ANT holders ultimately have governance power over the Court, we think it\u2019s important to at least understand $ANJ holders\u2019 views and use these to inform $ANT voting. From our perspective, the worst case outcome for both sides is a contentious $ANJ \u201cfork\u201d in which the community is split and Aragon Protocol now has a competitor with the same name (Aragon Court Classic?). Avoiding this outcome is crucial and, our research indicates, easily achievable.\n\nWe think $ANJ jurors who remain committed to the Court vision post merger are more valuable and are worth paying a higher premium to provide they convincingly signal this commitment. Projects such as Synthetix have exemplified the positive effects that locking up users can have on a community and on bootstrapping a supply-side and we feel there are lessons to be learned here. $ANJ holders who want to exit the system should still be allowed to do so and compensated for the upside they\u2019re giving up, but this should entail a much lower premium.\n\nAs such, we seek to give $ANJ holders a chance to express their views and signal what premium they would require in order to convert and lock up their $ANJ to $ANT for 12 months. Our goal is to avoid a splintered community and keep as much as possible of the $ANJ community as part of the future of $ANT.\n\n## Specification\n\n-   New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.02ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders who take the one-way conversion offer and lock the ANT they receive and activate it in Aragon Protocol for a period of 12 months.\n\n -  The Aragon Association will schedule a follow-up vote by $ANT holders on Monday November 23, 2020 lasting 48 hours to decide what conversion rate $ANJ holders who take the conversion offer but do not lock and activate their $ANT will receive. There will be three options, each option put to a separate vote with \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d as the response. The option that gets the most \u201cYes\u201d votes AND has more \u201cYes\u201d than \u201cNo\u201d votes will win. A tie will be broken by a vote of the Aragon Association Board of Directors + one advisor. The options that will be put to a vote are:\n      -  New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.015ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders to convert their $ANJ to $ANT with no lock + activation requirement.\n      -  New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.0175ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders to convert their $ANJ to $ANT with no lock + activation requirement.\n      -  New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.02ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders to convert their $ANJ to $ANT with no lock + activation requirement.\n\n## ANJ poll results\n[https://snapshot.page/#/anj/all](https://snapshot.page/#/anj/all)\n\nDiscussion\n\n[https://forum.aragon.org/t/proposal-next-steps-for-anj-holders/2478](https://forum.aragon.org/t/proposal-next-steps-for-anj-holders/2478)\n", "choices": ["No", "Yes"], "start": 1605715200, "end": 1605888000, "snapshot": "11282870", "state": "closed", "author": "0xA1d4C9e0a46068AfA3D8424B0618218Bf85ccaAA", "space": {"id": "aragon", "name": "Aragon"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSsbRcyQJXCSAp5cJGX9Pxxktqprh3uUGnEwHGkLJKeXm", "voter": "0x580a986b101A9Bed1283BfC7040F1153112b6c42", "created": 1605887432, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmST3wkV1d5EcQ2BE9vYpdEk3Pnwi2U8qbWpftQEju9DJi", "voter": "0xe3534F90E367F5bd62AF306d9F36804a82ba6cAc", "created": 1605883683, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmNkqtgALfnqhfkQYLvn8Gz3xUWZa692oGFg7zX6fGkHG5", "voter": "0x96646a92D0801b30C227404053A35c21A5290fec", "created": 1605866200, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmNqp38PY4oU9dkUU6d2md5BECa3myx2puoTZd3LGNJNhR", "voter": "0xf9c82b33C87Cfbbd1Ba7fa521dBC02dA31680F1a", "created": 1605862119, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmNarUkTxN6MgzF2h54jdaY8eNQkupJsfEUEvBp4hvciEV", "voter": "0x4C632beE45E771Beb190B821bb7aa9f2c3D152ba", "created": 1605805734, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "Qmchr4Vur1crVKXyJt6mG3NhNh6dNMK7R37MwFa3z2cYc1", "voter": "0x148a1E9373Ad8D83a8b12592ec90b6F5151b176f", "created": 1605791504, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmdbyQSdm2WiFTYJaA5zxJPihqtbiCGgVb2o7MQ7uC6Vq9", "voter": "0x8fC0620C1f2cf352727E56dF8a895c6779095EF0", "created": 1605778214, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmX5YWuxYWXjhApmLTQ6k8gDtAduHCBe4K5EM3e7Ph6WWu", "voter": "0x1a3e98369a9e935d5E807514Fd479Ebf075863c6", "created": 1605772773, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "Qmf2KnLkfNNmnmmNDLEHU1Zv3sgt21PHM2xoPq3meiEWzV", "voter": "0x98A729d4F94111ac21Df906fCdA107DcbC65d0B7", "created": 1605751483, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmUafc4D3u7R4XMm7E8GxtUT3eYaVmfxN6JJ9DzQhA3yog", "voter": "0xdD36C6C74abd4feF4EbCFB42D4622435D5f2c5f0", "created": 1605741004, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmWXhnzwe39xsDGb986Qn2fwNabFctHbMok7xb4kyAWQEF", "voter": "0x37Bf78fA8853CEE7df39280e70e38f3e163E44c4", "created": 1605721953, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}]}
