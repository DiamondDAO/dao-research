{"id": "Qmb2ZWCUcbTmTGg1Hfu8b8QNZ6vFhW74n614dEdjuwttku", "title": "Merge ANJ with ANT: 0.044 ANT/ANJ Proposal", "body": "## Summary \n\nIf approved by ANT holders, this proposal will result in an offer to ANJ holders to perform a one-way conversion of ANJ to ANT at a rate of 0.044 ANT per 1 ANJ. To take advantage of this offer, ANJ holders must commit to locking and activating the ANT they receive in Aragon Protocol for a period of one year.\n\n## Motivation \n\nThe recent discussions have demonstrated the strength of the $ANJ community and its conviction in the Aragon Court thesis. While $ANT holders ultimately have governance power over the Court, we think it\u2019s important to at least understand $ANJ holders\u2019 views and use these to inform $ANT voting. From our perspective, the worst case outcome for both sides is a contentious $ANJ \u201cfork\u201d in which the community is split and Aragon Protocol now has a competitor with the same name (Aragon Court Classic?). Avoiding this outcome is crucial and, our research indicates, easily achievable.\n\nWe think $ANJ jurors who remain committed to the Court vision post merger are more valuable and are worth paying a higher premium to provide they convincingly signal this commitment. Projects such as Synthetix have exemplified the positive effects that locking up users can have on a community and on bootstrapping a supply-side and we feel there are lessons to be learned here. $ANJ holders who want to exit the system should still be allowed to do so and compensated for the upside they\u2019re giving up, but this should entail a much lower premium.\n\n\nAs such, we seek to give $ANJ holders a chance to express their views and signal what premium they would require in order to convert and lock up their $ANJ to $ANT for 12 months. Our goal is to avoid a splintered community and keep as much as possible of the $ANJ community as part of the future of $ANT.\n\n## Specification\n\n- New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of  0.044ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders who take the one-way conversion offer and lock the ANT they receive and activate it in Aragon Protocol for a period of 12 months.\n\n- The Aragon Association will schedule a follow-up vote by $ANT holders on Monday November 23, 2020 lasting 48 hours to decide what conversion rate $ANJ holders who take the conversion offer but do not lock and activate their $ANT will receive. There will be three options, each option put to a separate vote with \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d as the response. The option that gets the most \u201cYes\u201d votes AND has more \u201cYes\u201d than \u201cNo\u201d votes will win. A tie will be broken by a vote of the Aragon Association Board of Directors + one advisor. The options that will be put to a vote are:\n  - New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.015ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders to convert their $ANJ to $ANT with no lock + activation requirement.\n  - New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.0175ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders to convert their $ANJ to $ANT with no lock + activation requirement.\n  - New $ANT will be minted to offer a conversion price of 0.02ANT/ANJ to $ANJ tokenholders to convert their $ANJ to $ANT with no lock + activation requirement.\n\n## ANJ poll results\n[https://snapshot.page/#/anj/all](https://snapshot.page/#/anj/all)\n\n## Discussion\n\n[https://forum.aragon.org/t/proposal-next-steps-for-anj-holders/2478](https://forum.aragon.org/t/proposal-next-steps-for-anj-holders/2478)\n", "choices": ["No", "Yes"], "start": 1605715200, "end": 1605888000, "snapshot": "11282870", "state": "closed", "author": "0xA1d4C9e0a46068AfA3D8424B0618218Bf85ccaAA", "space": {"id": "aragon", "name": "Aragon"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSu8aiiEJC8TmAHnehQGaRUUuDsNTURc4EdP6a9xV5EJH", "voter": "0xe3534F90E367F5bd62AF306d9F36804a82ba6cAc", "created": 1605883306, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmdgLZXsPq3nWzzTvveyiNyNN1cYH4uxXPWPCdZ5wUUNyy", "voter": "0x9990f00DD8167b83256A3159B2188DB4Bfe59116", "created": 1605879833, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmaWPKVMSGriykaUMkNkBDAETwnqtNmsGxyHN3UeoZtSBt", "voter": "0xf9c82b33C87Cfbbd1Ba7fa521dBC02dA31680F1a", "created": 1605862093, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmUQbLfahBnA8nHKpFJ7BXoRFaxXWHE26hxg1gj9ZTgBzt", "voter": "0x4C632beE45E771Beb190B821bb7aa9f2c3D152ba", "created": 1605805898, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "Qmdp1FZ4KHLn2WzEToFvhrg6MHY9GNx9muLb6LmnWyLEy1", "voter": "0x1a3e98369a9e935d5E807514Fd479Ebf075863c6", "created": 1605772851, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmTbw6k7CppYDAQ97JJEKiSdNikVA92E1KRn9mNQRmzDNs", "voter": "0xa4C539368A1A3cd94F9e834Ededb8E1dB841e67D", "created": 1605761781, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmdYwaH6Ph42nTg1rpDE4FTGMFrtsPXtgofjoYZhrSKXCu", "voter": "0x98A729d4F94111ac21Df906fCdA107DcbC65d0B7", "created": 1605751129, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmUQg9uM2DgucxsYzrhR41bRchCb8Y6K2iiFRVRjrsGc1k", "voter": "0xdD36C6C74abd4feF4EbCFB42D4622435D5f2c5f0", "created": 1605741211, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmSwyUrruZjqyhnRyj684VVNCZAzaZF8oDfUR94tGnhYE7", "voter": "0x95715f56D9fAf221a848CA6dA11BC603C53DC95E", "created": 1605727828, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmQT9y3cPqF9WGzEWYkoHskUzkb1F4k4KWNwJn27djmKNZ", "voter": "0x2E44eAbb2901FEFa4600994bCa2B80cD83Cf3178", "created": 1605725430, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmXdJ4WMTXpRH6AHVydohUnjfD7sScVhd9z5bxLRWPKadP", "voter": "0x37Bf78fA8853CEE7df39280e70e38f3e163E44c4", "created": 1605721872, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "Qme1b1pihieRk8UkYYkFzK7cgoyoepyiKE1TCmdyCKdeue", "voter": "0x1a9cEe6E1D21c3C09FB83A980EA54299f01920cd", "created": 1605720330, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}, {"id": "QmR76mDUv5sAAHiPRYxNP1WVvXVxV1qdLcKFN4NvbynW6L", "voter": "0x7a0d32cdd4511956d7c751A7Bb7bEaCE2321E17d", "created": 1605718316, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aragon"}}]}
