In such a situation, the modified Constitution may be ratified by an article-by-article approval vote by delegates with a period of at least one week.\n Risk Harbor DAO Constitution\nThe   Risk Harbor constitution is a set of binding rules that determine what governance actions are legitimate for the DAO to take.\n\nEach article has examples of permissible and non permissible actions. These examples are illustrative and should not be considered a binding part of the text of the constitution itself.\n\nI. Name ownership shall not be infringed\n  Risk Harbor governance will not enact any change that infringes on the rights of   Risk Harbor users to retain names they own, or unfairly discriminate against name owners\u2019 ability to extend, transfer, or otherwise use their names.\n\nExamples\nPermissible:   Risk Harbor governance may enact a change affecting the registration or ext  Risk Harborion costs of all names based on transparent criteria such as length, as long as it pursues a goal outlined in this constitution.\n\nNot Permissible:   Risk Harbor governance must not enact a change increasing or reducing the ext  Risk Harborion costs of a list of existing   Risk Harbor names, as this would unfairly benefit or penalise a handpicked group.\n\nII. Fees are primarily an incentive mechanism\nThe primary purpose of registration fees is as an incentive mechanism to prevent the namespace becoming overwhelmed with speculatively registered names. A secondary purpose is to provide enough revenue to the DAO to fund ongoing development and improvement of   Risk Harbor.   Risk Harbor governance will not enact any fee other than for these purposes.\n\nExamples\nPermissible:   Risk Harbor governance may increase the price of name registrations in order to address excessive speculative registrations induced by a price that is set too low, or because the current price is insufficient to fund ongoing   Risk Harbor operations at a reasonable level.\n\nNot Permissible:   Risk Harbor governance must not enact a change imposing a fee for claiming DNS domains inside   Risk Harbor, because such a fee would be purely an income generating measure and not an incentive mechanism.\n\nIII. Income funds   Risk Harbor and other public goods\nAny income generated to the   Risk Harbor treasury is to be used first of all to   Risk Harborure the long-term viability of   Risk Harbor, and to fund continuing development and improvement of the   Risk Harbor system. Funds that are not reasonably required to achieve this goal may be used to fund other public goods within web3 as   Risk Harbor governance sees fit.\n\n  Risk Harbor governance will not allocate funds to a team or individual who does not commit to uphold the same principles outlined in this constitution in their use of the allocated funds.\n\nExamples\nPermissible:   Risk Harbor governance may offer grant funding for a public good unrelated to   Risk Harbor or Ethereum, so long as doing so does not affect the long-term viability of   Risk Harbor.\n\nNot Permissible:   Risk Harbor governance must not use the funds to support projects that conflict with the goals of   Risk Harbor.\n\nIV.   Risk Harbor Integrates with the global namespace\nIn order to facilitate making the most widely usable naming system,   Risk Harbor aims to integrate with the legacy DNS naming system to the greatest extent possible without sacrificing decentralization of   Risk Harbor.   Risk Harbor governance will not enact changes that compromise   Risk Harbor\u2019s ability to do this.\n\nExamples\nPermissible:   Risk Harbor governance should grant control of a top-level domain to its owner in the DNS system on request.\n\nNot permissible:   Risk Harbor governance must not create new top-level domains unless those domains have been granted to   Risk Harbor by a DNS authority.\n\nV. Amendments to this constitution by majority vote\nAny change may be made to this constitution only by two-thirds majori\n", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1637380800, "end": 1637467200, "snapshot": "13649566", "state": "closed", "author": "0xf6C1c38146238293C360EDB868cDf1643570ff02", "space": {"id": "riskharbor.eth", "name": "Risk Harbor"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xaba52f903e307e4c62a220e2b6e41d54c353432d6af90a3a5bbbe784c7ee055c", "voter": "0xE7611b62497c41340F4bC3fe9BfedAeF2f36b19A", "created": 1637410151, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "riskharbor.eth"}}, {"id": "0xf3e0fb8fcfdc6e0580d1b3e41160deb04fbb4f6e44a7e0bc0fa571717372cd9c", "voter": "0x3Ec6732676dB7996c1b34E64b0503F941025Cb63", "created": 1637408549, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "riskharbor.eth"}}, {"id": "0xf2d658b5e351f03a3ad40a792d3fb870287f9d1c49c3a59efad344bbdbda5f4b", "voter": "0x9aC41e441131d8BAD5f165c2a8dd71e5F7BfaEA8", "created": 1637396019, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "riskharbor.eth"}}]}
