Nevertheless, this proposal should be a sign of the continuous community support to the Team to achieve a joint growth, as the community is happy to see the rapid progress the Team has achieved in recent months while being highly transparent throughout the process.\n\nAs such, it is proposed to add a MILK2-NFTS Liquidity Pool on BSC Interstellar to allow SpaceSwap Investors to farm NFTS, similar to NFTS Investors being able to farm MILK2 through the proposed NFTS-MILK2 Liquidity Pools.\n\nBy doing so, the Team will create further synergies that are equal for both projects to achieve a joint community.", "choices": ["Agree", "Disagree"], "start": 1623009600, "end": 1623182400, "snapshot": "12582698", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7904b3a55D2e9a4Ec36871Bea3dd4dA147f29137", "space": {"id": "spaceswap", "name": "SpaceSwap"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRSgYggSDMZ2ijAkSTq4fTQw43ix5EENGjnDAfvXcZxW3", "voter": "0x92D9b0a91177A2b7713125dcafc1CEde6BBDEE05", "created": 1623139991, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "spaceswap"}}, {"id": "QmRmCajDJGijGgRCy32dXiWdErrtiim7D961cX5aMZMWjG", "voter": "0xc4b0d84f84CFE5A021E4752a9E7861aF3683AD59", "created": 1623139960, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "spaceswap"}}, {"id": "QmdJFfkArGkadg6pT22xbr37hSQfA6oNzatyu8GtC4Sg2D", "voter": "0x5147DA73545BfF6E30abb7Fdb330e656Bc21BcC1", "created": 1623139945, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "spaceswap"}}, {"id": "QmbMfP29oozAxVC6KLPXHGm5v1yN4JWVkxA9YDF8oe3Tck", "voter": "0x94E0f12B48F2098CBfC0EF12Ed1F3b8e900a119f", "created": 1623139929, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "spaceswap"}}, {"id": "QmeuQPC5Swg7uTw4qXWYZWjcBWCbfQiwqXtTKNB4reEfNP", "voter": "0x0E01c6cD6582aDd47D8F7746607F46eF0fEE8d98", "created": 1623074546, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "spaceswap"}}]}
