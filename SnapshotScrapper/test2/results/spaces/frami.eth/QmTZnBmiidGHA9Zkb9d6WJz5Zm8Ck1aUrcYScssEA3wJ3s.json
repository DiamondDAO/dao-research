Using Point Motion markerless motion capture technology via the built-in camera, or an external camera, to track users physical activity and allow them to track their own progress and performance over time. We want to bring MotionMine to the Metaverse in support of health as well as prosperity; where we reward activity with redeemed points that are interchangeable for wearables and other prizes.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 MANA\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9982b469910c2Ee2EA566dCfCc250CDD34056397\n\n## Description\n\nBy bringing an opportunity to be rewarded for being physically active, we can not only bring a healthy habit to our Decentraland citizens of being active, but this will also inspire other big brands like Adidas and Nike to explore how this space can be used to connect on values they represent. We also aim to solve a major health issues around the increasingly sedentary lifestyle inadvertently caused by extended use of virtual reality platforms.\n\n1 in 4 people sit greater than 8 hours a day;\n4 in 10 are physically inactive.\n1 in 10 are both - they sit for more than eight\nhours, and they're physically inactive.\n\nThis leads to serious health complications in the long term which do not protect or serve the best interests of our community.\n\nThose involved in this are all citizens of Decentraland and want to see our community grow, included a partnership with the SciArtLab district in Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nDetailed Presentation: https://pointmotioncontrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Motion-Mine-DAO-proposal-2021.pdf\nThis project will be completed using Point Motion technology and API to deliver content and experiences into Decentraland. In partnership with SciArtLab, the Point Motion team alongside the expert team at MetaZoo International, we plan on building a unique environment that fosters good mental and physical health in our community.\n\nPlease feel free to review here for more information: https://pointmotioncontrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Motion-Mine-DAO-proposal-2021.pdf\nPoint Motion (https://www.pointmotioncontrol.com/)\nMetaZoo International (-110, 20)\nSciArtLab (https://www.sciartlab.com/)\n\nFor more information - Slide 9 : https://pointmotioncontrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Motion-Mine-DAO-proposal-2021.pdf\nPoint Motion Control\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nPoint Motion - Interactive Digital Health Content for Healthcare Pr...\n\nPoint Motion provides digital health content that enables automatic data collection on motor and cognitive client engagement through embedded technology (i.e. motion capture, music interaction)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe have displayed down our roadmap and milestones on slide 11: https://pointmotioncontrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Motion-Mine-DAO-proposal-2021.pdf\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.io/en/proposal/?id=7c4e73d0-d376-11eb-a4b0-23a26bd590ca)**", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1624379100, "end": 1624379700, "snapshot": "12685074", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2Ba0352480bd1Ea073A83e6639b06362131894CE", "space": {"id": "frami.eth", "name": "frami y otras hierbas"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
