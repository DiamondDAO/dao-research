It features social aspects, multiplayer gameplay. Engaging players through XP progress, avoiding pay to win as much as possible.\n\nWe are Pablo and Eibriel, with a long trajectory on Decentraland projects including multiplayer experiences. Pablo ended, after 9 years, previous job in mid May 2021 focusing 100% on content around Decentraland and Eibriel is doing it for quite time, being this project our main focus right now, working on it full time.\n\nThis is our biggest project till date, that started cooking before last GameJam 2020 on paper and drafts, selected among an amount of different project ideas. We have been working on it for some weeks now.\n\n### GRANT SIZE\n\n5,000 USD\n\n### BENEFICIARY ADDRESS\n\n0xE8643B09CF5A016AA2F1c2E9371dcEAdD362BB00\n\n### DESCRIPTION\n\nThis could be one of the most complete gaming experiences till date on Decentraland, helping users to stay connected with high social features, to engage in community interaction and have fun without need to be a pro-gamer user.\n\nThe funds will be used mostly to cover the work we can't or that we are not so productive at, like graphic design, marketing, audio, business infrastructure etc. Also to help prevent burning our savings, allowing us to keep focused on the project.\n\n### SPECIFICATION\n\nApplying Agile methodology we have defined a roadmap with a first playable prototype by mid-end of July where a player can start feeling the game. This is already in the works, and we are already experiencing a good playability experience.\n\nRegarding technical resources, the game requires a real time multiplayer server (sockets) as well as a big database.\n\nTo keep the game as a surprise, but at the same time be able to report the status of the progress, we will be sharing the progress with members of the Decentraland Foundation and selected members of the community.\n\n### PERSONNEL\n\nPablo.dcl.eth (Mana-fever.com), Senior programmer with more than a decade of professional experience, the last 9 years were spent on WebApp Product from swiss company, focused mostly on Frontend work (javascript).
