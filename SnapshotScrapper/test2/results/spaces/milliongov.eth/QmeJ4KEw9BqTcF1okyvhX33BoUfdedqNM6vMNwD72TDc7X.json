{"id": "QmeJ4KEw9BqTcF1okyvhX33BoUfdedqNM6vMNwD72TDc7X", "title": "MM Prize Tournaments?", "body": "Based on a recent proposal about decentralised betting, an idea occurred to me: how about creating tournaments (in any area from poker to Counterstrike) and using MM as the prize money?\n\nHere's the general idea:\n\nWith the help of one popular gamer (probably on Twitch; Techlead is probably the only one with the clout to pull off this part of the idea!) we can create a tournament on a popular game, probably FPS based, and assign a pot of money in the form of MM tokens to the winner. Participants stake a fixed value of MM tokens (1 or 0.5 or something) for a chance to test their skills and win say 50-100MM, which is provided by anyone who wants to \"invest\" in the tournament.\n\nSo the financials work like this:\n\n- participants pay a nominal fee to enter and are supported by decent servers, infrastructure, decent admins who can manage the tournament lists and playing times, etc.\nThe total amount of participants makes up the entire TURNOVER of the project.\n\n- investors put up a proportion of the prize pot to be won by whichever participant is victorious. This is a fixed-number of MM tokens. For example let's say 4 investors each stake 25MM tokens, bringing the prize pot to 100MM.\nIf one thousand participants enter, then each investors gets a percentage of that TURNOVER based on what percentage of the prize pot they put in, here it would be 25%. If one put in 40MM of the 100MM total, then they'd get 40%... and so on.\n\n- Promoters, big-tickets gamers, platform fees, etc., all that stuff... all paid out of the TURNOVER from the participants.\n\nSo in short, everyone gets paid. And if you're a participant who fully well knows you suck at counterstrike, you're basically just paying money to be constantly flashbanged and destroyed on discord... (you know you love it).\n\n\nThoughts on this idea?\n\n\nP.S.   Unfortunately, in the list above, I can only be the investor, because I can't play worth shit and don't know how to run a discord server xD", "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"], "start": 1636286400, "end": 1636718400, "snapshot": "13569523", "state": "closed", "author": "0x575f11079DbD7B88527C87AC059d5519A056c0a2", "space": {"id": "milliongov.eth", "name": "Million Gov"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQ5ESjrnTJZVN876Waqqu1DkFZqXA7UWzvRQwXALkDc9s", "voter": "0xd9A0e6D8A1B33ed2B743D87783Bca5aC83f260Fd", "created": 1636604337, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "milliongov.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc77519808b28f52f4fd60e53e8bea4eb55264136d513a1bd08abb94e1870097e", "voter": "0x01725a69f9873A046381bbF07e108ffC07b14900", "created": 1636395287, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "milliongov.eth"}}, {"id": "0x208a64a0061bb761388a8c6f6680671ab063b26072d5022f56e5c15fe706af8e", "voter": "0xdDA5cb5650962eEB33660646e6b8D701f507F0b3", "created": 1636355805, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "milliongov.eth"}}, {"id": "0xaa001bff31e64c0305ead09f945f658eba9e386f8e6f08851f26d4fee6d62ba1", "voter": "0x2560441287F1B59fA3cf101DC25dbB0aCe355673", "created": 1636324014, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "milliongov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbCQAFeeVTqMwoYcssgjFj7y2BPK3WX8nPmUUCqRWepDJ", "voter": "0x6eFF768601Ccd24e1F2C2f78C5C9b6E786B9262c", "created": 1636310812, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "milliongov.eth"}}, {"id": "0xa6c69ea7834893556fc9388bf32017380b54b077d6dbdb65e416ffb7a812c291", "voter": "0x245b97E2d5F68234B752EE001de381208f9e186f", "created": 1636308082, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "milliongov.eth"}}]}
