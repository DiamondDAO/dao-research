Before we enable the trading and deposit/withdrawal features we want the community to vote and decide the initial set of 10 players that will be available for trading on day 1. Users with more than 500 TSX in their wallet will be able to vote.\n\nBased on the upcoming cricket calendar, we have preselected 138 Fractional NFT markets to feature on the platform. Most of these will be initially locked and will require users to unlock them before fantasy stocks can be traded. By unlocking, users will provide the initial liquidity to the NFT markets.\n\nTradeStars will provide liquidity for 10 Fractional NFT markets on day 1 to allow users to start trading and to get them familiarized with the platform. Going forward we will engage the community to also choose what star players should be partially unlocked and added.\n\nThe Polls - Complete the list of 10 unlocked players\n\nThe TradeStars team has chosen 7 NFT Markets to be fully unlocked and will ask the community to participate in a set of polls to choose the remaining 3.\n\nThere will be three available polls:\n\nChose an ALL ROUNDER player to be unlocked by TradeStars on day 1\nChose a BOWLER player to be unlocked by TradeStars on day 1\nChose a BATSMAN player to be unlocked by TradeStars on day 1\n\nStart date and time: 28 June 2021 - 8:00pm UTC\nEnd date and time: 1 July 2021 - 12:00pm UTC (midday)\n\nEligibility to vote and rules:\n\nUsers with more than 500 TSX will be eligible to vote.\nAll users will vote once in each poll.\nAll votes count as one (regardless of the number of TSX)\nA web 3.0 wallet is required", "choices": ["Hanuma Vihari", "Fawad Alam", "Sharjeel Khan"], "start": 1624896000, "end": 1625126400, "snapshot": "12723450", "state": "closed", "author": "0x850cd4A31113D701E4A95Dba94938Ffe5F99467c", "space": {"id": "tradestars.eth", "name": "TradeStars"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmY1zFLyv5fq9RB35gPtARycLAEegLQYcqo6YjkYQJFe1B", "voter": "0xbC060d1df2bA36cF8E04d7D1194945C9Af4dFdBD", "created": 1624978475, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tradestars.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWCpR27MkNw3jExCaavTpSwTu7p8YBr1dUxk4bJbPyFk8", "voter": "0x27ba4866e29ED079f75697B93C39dF5118FdBcFb", "created": 1624949920, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tradestars.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTcxt1BBhK7LKv5cy2CKEudnjVMK7oSvDUp9Ca9ZGPTz4", "voter": "0x850cd4A31113D701E4A95Dba94938Ffe5F99467c", "created": 1624949829, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "tradestars.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVpz2hNvs4qYqoCZxSy5wGePvk7zi2zE34XARApxe62Wh", "voter": "0xaeBAd2B3adE48453916021B243bf837d02c48f3c", "created": 1624907445, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tradestars.eth"}}]}
