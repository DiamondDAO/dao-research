One may unstake anytime, but stakers that last the longest maximize their rewards and those that unstake before others will receive less rewards.\n\nLet's choose a primary protocol from a few options of the most popular decentralized liquidity provider platforms.\n\n* [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)\n* [1inch Exchange](https://1inch.exchange/)\n* [SushiSwap](https://www.sushi.com/)\n* [HoneySwap](https://honeyswap.org/)\n\n\n### NOTE\n\nThis decision is pending the results of [$ZFOGG yield farming #QmQshi4](https://dao.zfo.gg/#/zfogg.eth/proposal/QmQshi4EDu6FCW7NVFFSncdx7p4HoPpbsAX1FV11CqSqb5).\n\n* If Ethereum is chosen for the network, any of these options are valid *except Honeyswap*.\n* If xDai is chosen for the network, we'll use [Honeyswap](https://honeyswap.org/) and the [xDai Chain OmniBridge](https://omni.xdaichain.com/).\n* If Binance Smart Chain is chosen, we'll use 1inch.\n\nThe top-most valid choice will win out. This proposal will be open for two weeks - a decision will be selected one week after the yield farming decision ([#QmQshi4](https://dao.zfo.gg/#/zfogg.eth/proposal/QmQshi4EDu6FCW7NVFFSncdx7p4HoPpbsAX1FV11CqSqb5)) is made.", "choices": ["Uniswap", "1inch Exchange", "SushiSwap", "Honeyswap"], "start": 1614618000, "end": 1615824000, "snapshot": "11954841", "state": "closed", "author": "0x276Adf94808668338ff61df00d63c2F8ce056206", "space": {"id": "zfogg.eth", "name": "zfogg"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZPQNJzxGkxouo5ZijptVQMj3c77ebsZPmymCNFPRFtaX", "voter": "0x58233A702fd05B982A98b02a4A3064ea89249C4D", "created": 1614635993, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "zfogg.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW57hdMhBMLe9yN5nU4K9PRoM7w4ZBxGoCp75EhSYfvTr", "voter": "0xe15b0058d7470DccBB124b283bA86498A12CaB74", "created": 1614635954, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zfogg.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWUBeQGGauwk9Fxi83HmU8LENuUXpfd6VVwppYLcQPTHS", "voter": "0x276Adf94808668338ff61df00d63c2F8ce056206", "created": 1614635932, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "zfogg.eth"}}]}
