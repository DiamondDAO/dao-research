ASKING THE PROBLEM:\n The fact that Defily is funded and is preparing to join the Harmony blockchain ecosystem is an important step forward, but also a challenge to re-affirm the project's position in the field that the project's goals have set and implementation(Defi,gamefi,NFTs...). After a period of investing, participating, learning and accompanying the project from my personal point of view, there are still some issues that need to be clarified and improved:\n -In the past, expanding from Kai chain to BSC was a good development direction, but not being able to connect two chains (Kai-BSC) was an inadequacy, so it was forced to first release on BSC and only use B-DFL only. to farm should lead to OVER INFLATION, B-DLF value drops too deeply (K-DFL can still be used for Dragon game application).\n -The value of K-DFL and B-DFL has HUGE PRICE DIFFERENCE, the same project management token that between chains such price difference is not costly for project development.\n -Releasing games on Kai to take advantage of cheap fees is good but not on BSC leads to TOKEN DFL UNUSED FOR THE ENTIRE Ecosystem.\n2. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTATION:\n - BEFORE joining the Harmony chain (total supply of 20 million H-DFLs) will not issue H-DFL for the first time, but CREATE A BIRTH FIRST TO CONVERT DFL from Kai and BSC to Harmony. when people need to Farm or use services on Harmoy, they will have to buy K-DFL or B-DFL to Bridge to Harmony, leading to the need to buy issued DFLs leading to STOP THE OVER INFLATION of the current DFL Now, it will rebalance the price when BSC is expected to be used more because of the cheap price to FARM THE HARMONY and stop the downtrend, creating confidence for many new investors to join the project.\n -When it is possible to Bridge from BSC to Harmony and Bridge from Harmony to Kai, DLF will really be used for the entire ecosystem to take advantage of the strengths of each Chain (with Kai, promoting GameFi because of cheap fees, with BSC developing NFT because of the large market, with Harmony promoting Defi because there is a lot of potential for growth)\n 3. TARGET MUC:\n -Releasing the bridge in the fourth quarter according to the set schedule.\n -Join the Harmony ecosystem as soon as possible.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1635512400, "end": 1635692400, "snapshot": "12179130", "state": "closed", "author": "0x48ba1365d1F87EB205492B00247EAF0780Bf5892", "space": {"id": "defily.eth", "name": "Defily DAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
