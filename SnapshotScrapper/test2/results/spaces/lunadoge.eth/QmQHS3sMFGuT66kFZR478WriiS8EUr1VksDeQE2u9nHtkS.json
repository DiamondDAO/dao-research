Obviously, the team needs to be careful with blowing their marketing wallet wod, so some might think this is premature. \nI'd argue that we need to get some momentum back for both the price and morale. \n\nI'm not sure how much it costs to have a big YouTuber to push a project so maybe a top 50 channel is out of the question. I've seen smaller channels with 15k + subscribers who might be affordable and get us decent exposure.\nExamples/suggestions would be: Crypto ZEUS, and Brandon10x\n\nThey're in the 20k range of subscribers and have a lot of vids about Safemoon (especially ZEUS) and this might be a good audience to hit (considering the LOGE is a fork of Safemoon) to attract some new buyers.
