As you know, since the ownership of the stake contracts has been renounced, I have no chance to interfere with the contracts. So the only chance I\u2019ll be able to do this will be to put the unlocked tokens I have in the anyan stake pool. Thus, the emission of aNyan stake pool will be reduced by about half.\n\nIn this way, I want to direct new investors who want to benefit from high APR to add liquidity to the pool by buying tokens.\n\nIf we do this, I believe that both the liquidity pool will grow and the price will be positively affected.\n\nI want to withdraw the staking rewards of the tokens I will lock on a weekly basis and allocate half to the developer wallet and half to the marketing fund. Thus, we will both have a developer fund that can continue development and create a budget for marketing.\n\nI present this issue for your consideration.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1633856400, "end": 1633942800, "snapshot": "5451255", "state": "closed", "author": "0x27854A16aB3154FB8D8c52fDbA67063EC86f5072", "space": {"id": "avanyan.eth", "name": "AvaNyan"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUSdT6V623TXrEFwGU372kpnSXyUwb7k4EjWCa56LTi4n", "voter": "0x8D6e1F789585741b8C5Fb941471d2B719015bA2C", "created": 1633938439, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "avanyan.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYiFVEfEed17ZbHKPr5TJ8koj9mHppQSoJU1mYtVo7Ps3", "voter": "0x72de31d356890E3c96DaDBee94C192dE914535c6", "created": 1633893817, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "avanyan.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX5rEVzSyJevT89tLX4SbRSEx5Ci3hWbBWGcBEeM8RHHC", "voter": "0x9E6E3Bb67f0BC2904787B0d907d27579877ca963", "created": 1633893724, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "avanyan.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdEroR3aVHPVL8FWscanJGN7ucfyfXZuzqWx8GhU6nhPU", "voter": "0xc82dAC2Ca56E00EDC41609CA2674a9E21BC9B8C1", "created": 1633883175, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "avanyan.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUKTWdzTeZgvd9ZdWPkyWdmdf3DEtsNsZjGYkzooErtJM", "voter": "0xe0BC74371D1D92FF132d50B4C46b1D723663B66b", "created": 1633880862, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "avanyan.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYu6gxF55URfe6HruGrJcjuQ95uSSUMPCxBMQcnoS9nHi", "voter": "0x1749F4aA848Aeab728f1D183E24dF13cf22864d0", "created": 1633863180, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "avanyan.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW5C8AnKb1CkNoWXoUkM4zebzL93WRs3hWBXLQHbbuuMk", "voter": "0x347e4B5b51D3a03234209071A55709F1fE434Fe9", "created": 1633861659, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "avanyan.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaFPVy9S37KHHrWMRr6xyfG398mUzSGo3ceZM38j5THYp", "voter": "0x8aD9dBC38ea6D4022Dc6E93e2BA003Ed364759C7", "created": 1633856883, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "avanyan.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZFNATZE98Fs3czmAZgpAjMoAhQM5d8nSG9EAh8S2bCi6", "voter": "0x77E64560Bd6C323c075F206a5AB9dD6850F31609", "created": 1633856476, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "avanyan.eth"}}]}
