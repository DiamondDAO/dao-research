With the launch of the stabling in issuance project uu.finance initiated by the core volunteers of the s.finance community, the community plans to migrate the SFG liquidity pool from Balancer to Uniswap. In order to ensure the smooth migration process, it is necessary to reduce or cancel the SFG reward weight of the current Balancer pool first.\n\nAt present, the following two schemes are given:\n## Plan\n1. Reduce the reward weight of the SFG liquidity pool to 10% and give the original 30% weight to the 5pool pool\n2. Cancel the SFG liquidity pool reward and wait for the SFG liquidity pool to migrate. The original 40% weight will be given to the 5pool pool\n> If you have better suggestions, please initiate a proposal\n\n## The voting time\n2021.2.8 00:00-2021.2.8 23:59 SGT\n", "choices": [" Reduce SFG liquidity rewards", "Cancel SFG liquidity rewards"], "start": 1612713600, "end": 1612799940, "snapshot": "11809659", "state": "closed", "author": "0x0DdD732AC31D2a4A51552e707FB0DcB0F65062f4", "space": {"id": "s-finance", "name": "S.Finance"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWc67Fr11NWdLx39jmYnyNKwko11pr8gVXyJUnhq2CL5Z", "voter": "0x832028D5cC7083d1Ed9635dD51e6807f84840ca8", "created": 1612793263, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "s-finance"}}, {"id": "QmatA166zHYLv8qonX58ENRQypsJsn11HRvpwLVjucrKbi", "voter": "0x4be4727aCb98486E38470b96b150029A55e80131", "created": 1612793258, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "s-finance"}}, {"id": "QmRhhGNQgbd7H5LKT59KUXqEqNLJFCCjojjAv5qYkdFbpY", "voter": "0xD00cA0FfbB7c60565DF73a2596D4A5056f02d02F", "created": 1612793204, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "s-finance"}}, {"id": "QmbPE2YzBER7WqWu4ipEww4oTiPQ1YR4ATEpugCuUWcNYB", "voter": "0x04117dE5Bf2910BA59C83d69534D80d574cf3375", "created": 1612792993, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "s-finance"}}, {"id": "QmNRYHkrQ5DGjzjEUk7ZuReq4zBpm4WQekoQsa2SBoMwfj", "voter": "0xF3a8F83A4DebfFacfC370f72Ca8b7f288803878a", "created": 1612792906, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "s-finance"}}, {"id": "QmU9BDStxCfrfD1DgsrKafj43Z9UAowS9r9r9JFg437mQx", "voter": "0x0DdD732AC31D2a4A51552e707FB0DcB0F65062f4", "created": 1612790318, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "s-finance"}}, {"id": "QmSzAkUVc8FYPdde6PPdmfT7iPz6iGKXC4YcLeodpkm5si", "voter": "0x1d22aBf08A30a7881D8F6B24b52E7586272BA20b", "created": 1612790283, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "s-finance"}}, {"id": "QmdkaDbkAQjYbA8uUmBodkuQdi9PpABC5poJQCzynJp6bM", "voter": "0x154E45ca1B9Ce33987856222be380618Ad4a4462", "created": 1612720314, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "s-finance"}}]}
