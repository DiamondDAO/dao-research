Understandably if all that boob was sold for a stablecoin it would appear as a dump so this should be coordinated and at a steady rate to not further impact the price of BOOB. \n\nThe stablecoin we might benefit from is USDN as it provides ~10% APY just for holding in a wallet so this marketing fund would also grow just by being held without being subject to market volatility. \n\n# Choices\n- SWAP FULL FUND: `This would be in favor of moving the entire marketing fund to USDN`\n- SWAP PARTIAL FUND: `This would be in favor of moving part (50% or less) of the marketing fund to USDN`\n- KEEP IN BOOB: `This would be in favor of keeping it in BOOB how it is currently`\n- MODIFY PROPOSAL: `This would mean you are interested in the proposal but would like some of the terms to be modified`\n", "choices": ["SWAP FULL FUND", "SWAP PARTIAL FUND", "KEEP IN BOOB", "MODIFY PROPOSAL"], "start": 1607191200, "end": 1607407200, "snapshot": "11397103", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3d2f61ff2F217498c0d236D6246D618CAdE5b5b4", "space": {"id": "bbra.eth", "name": "BooBanker Research Association"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZoe9uNqbmFMhEkGw6EHGSYe2mK2SqNAPUUgEd5GNHbm1", "voter": "0x341648d1eB4e829dbD413AB9E34f87726186C1DB", "created": 1607368280, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "bbra.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma6YpHVSTMdVsuaCxnqkbMkjxVoDrutiruDvQiRi4SKsm", "voter": "0xFEF62149c62076225efBEd920cD7A2860AC9C8d8", "created": 1607356612, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "bbra.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRLPPLCmduatDaTKTTyDMCdLaPeunnNsjib5k5YVvcnjq", "voter": "0x733AbA8b38B264b26956BFF0e76E9b92C6BbFF74", "created": 1607284099, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "bbra.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeGP16x9NypH57vFWspfiQ3FiwFf4NxugAnoAAiwhmoM3", "voter": "0xea8aE909DaD4081a50423f75687c580729dc2Cc5", "created": 1607274791, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "bbra.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma9nQYQWmw4HExnQFRsL1JQNvf1RJ4R6CE2P1uNuq9gyb", "voter": "0x3d2f61ff2F217498c0d236D6246D618CAdE5b5b4", "created": 1607256956, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "bbra.eth"}}]}
