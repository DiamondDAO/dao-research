Low BRS Gotchis are more scarce but not rewarded in any way. To balance things out, instead of having the extreme 2 ends of high BRS for 'Rarity Farming', perhaps we can introduce a separate leaderboard for 'Normie Farming' to reward Gotchis who strive to stay in the middle '50' score, adding another dimension to choosing wearables stats, choosing which Gotchi to summon/buy, and maybe more to come, in the Realm / Mini-games. Normies deserve some luv too!", "choices": ["Yes, lets give normies some luv", "No, high BRS ftw"], "start": 1631505600, "end": 1632801600, "snapshot": "19053467", "state": "closed", "author": "0xaf4fA10C1e93E9C60149F386CE783a4BC2952a77", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
