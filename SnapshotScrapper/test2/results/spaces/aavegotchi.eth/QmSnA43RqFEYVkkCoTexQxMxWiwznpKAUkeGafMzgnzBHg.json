Large buyers and sellers can currently buy in and out without any fees. \n\nOur market maker offers the ability to add fees to buy and sell orders. \n\nMultiple community members have proposed adding fees up to 0.3% to buying and selling on the curve. \n\nThis is possible to do by calling the`updateFees`function on our bonding curve, but should we? \n\nIt\u2019s up to you, AavegotchiDAO. \n\nOptions:\n1. 0.3 fee for buying and selling on the curve\n2. 0.3 fee for only selling\n3. No fees (leave as is)\n\nAny fees would automatically be transferred to our Aragon DAO Treasury address at `0xffe6280ae4e864d9af836b562359fd828ece8020` and would be considered as assets of AavegotchiDAO (separate from the tap emission, which is reserved for usage by Pixelcraft Studios).", "choices": ["0.3% fee for buying and selling", "0.3% fee just for selling", "No fees (leave as is)"], "start": 1610337600, "end": 1610942400, "snapshot": "11653277", "state": "closed", "author": "0x027Ffd3c119567e85998f4E6B9c3d83D5702660c", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
