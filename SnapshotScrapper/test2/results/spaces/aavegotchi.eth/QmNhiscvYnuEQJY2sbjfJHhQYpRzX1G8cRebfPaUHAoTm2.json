There are a lot of people that unfortunately were not able to get a portal or could not afford it from the second hand market Baazaar.\n\nMy Proposal for Haunt 2:\n\nLaunch around 2-3 months from now or when minigames is ready for people that missed out on H1 or newcomers to join in.\n\nCost around 5-10 USD worth of GHST\n\nHave 5 common traits + 1 random traits(1-100) so it could still be able to compete in minigames but not in rarity farming.\n\nMore common looks, maybe smaller like a lil gotchi idea another member proposed.\n\nThis proposal aims to make the game more affordable to gamers and people who missed out while retaining the value and rarity of Haunt 1 aavegotchis. By being distinctively different from Haunt 1, this will drastically increase the chances that whales from Haunt 1 will support because this proposal would most likely not affect the prices of current gotchis and wearables. Hopefully this can help cater towards both target markets of NFT collectors/investors(mainly those that are from Haunt 1 or buyers in Bazaar) and gamers/tamagotchi fans to mutually benefit from this entire ecosystem.", "choices": ["I agree with this proposal", "I disagree with this proposal"], "start": 1615089600, "end": 1615608000, "snapshot": "11805759", "state": "closed", "author": "0x94a5b840F6898E5178649A2b117B3cE3BB7aA873", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
