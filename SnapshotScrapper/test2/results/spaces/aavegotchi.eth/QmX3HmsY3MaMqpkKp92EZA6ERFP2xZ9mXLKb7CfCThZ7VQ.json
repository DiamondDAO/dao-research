Spicing up the Discord channel up \n2. Raising awareness about our cute little ghosties!\n3. So we can spam emojis all day long in the Discord between us ghost frens", "choices": ["Yes emojis pls sirs", "Nah I like using default pleb emojis"], "start": 1600430400, "end": 1601035200, "snapshot": "10945054", "state": "closed", "author": "0x67023130eaAb2969E26e5a25E2AbF901C01bCDA0", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
