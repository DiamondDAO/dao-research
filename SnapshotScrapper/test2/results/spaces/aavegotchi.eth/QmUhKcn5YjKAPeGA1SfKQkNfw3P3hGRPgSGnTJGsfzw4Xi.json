The most popular options were: 1, 5, and 10 Portals per transaction. \n\nOur fren @coderdannn also threw a spicy idea into the mix: an \"Ape Tax\" whereby higher numbers of Portals could be bought in a single transaction, but at a higher price. The Portals would be tiered as so: \n\n-0-5: 100 GHST each\n-6-15: 200 GHST each\n-16-25: 300 GHST each\n\n**So this leaves us with four options: 1, 5, 10, and 25 (w/ ape tax).**\n\nLet your $GHST token speak for you, and vote! \n\n* Voting period: 72 hrs\n* Minimum quorum: 10% of GHST on Matic (~1.1M GHST)\n\nAavegotchiDAO discussion topic \ud83d\udc47\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/how-many-portals-should-be-bought-in-one-txn/17", "choices": ["1 per txn", "5 per txn", "10 per txn", "25 per txn (w/ Ape Tax)"], "start": 1614052800, "end": 1614312000, "snapshot": "11224608", "state": "closed", "author": "0x027Ffd3c119567e85998f4E6B9c3d83D5702660c", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
