May I propose that in the meantime, we have some sort of NFTs Liquidity Mining (Idea taken from MEME Ltd) to keep GHST relevant in the mind of crypto enthusiast. \n\nA common occurrence in the world of cryptocurrency is that hype does not often last, and actions must be carried out in order to build the momentum before everyone forgets about the project.\n\nTherefore, I am proposing the introduction of simple NFT farming so that early adopters can stake their GHST in exchange for in-app currency (like pineapples in MEME's case) which are only tradable within the Aavegotchi ecosystem itself for collectible NFTs.", "choices": ["Yes, let's do it!", "No, let's not stray away from roadmap"], "start": 1600657200, "end": 1601262000, "snapshot": "10909500", "state": "closed", "author": "0x73e9aeeEf2d4455324661009ed2561489986be4e", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
