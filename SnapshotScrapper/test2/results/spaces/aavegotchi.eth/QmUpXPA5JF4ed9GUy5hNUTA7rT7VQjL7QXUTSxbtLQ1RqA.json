However, as many community members have noted, liquidity for the GHST-USDC pair is still not deep enough to support trading large amounts of USDC for GHST on Quickswap. \n\nWe believe one way to remedy this is by adding GHST-USDC as a pair eligible for FRENS on https://aavegotchi.com/stake-matic. Just like GHST-QUICK has a receipt token stkGHST-QUICK, staked GHST-USDC can also emit a stkGHST-USDC token, which may be eligible for rewards on Quickswap, if their team deems it necessary. \n\nSince this decision directly affects gameplay, we believe it is a ripe candidate for our first Snapshot vote on Matic. \n\nWe are setting a 500,000 GHST quorum for this vote to be enacted. \n\nThe GHST-USDC LP token will earn FRENS at the same rate as just staking GHST, since impermanent loss is minimal and fees are significant. \n", "choices": ["Yes, let GHST-USDC LP earn FRENS", "No, we have enough FRENS"], "start": 1612756800, "end": 1613016000, "snapshot": "10593248", "state": "closed", "author": "0x027Ffd3c119567e85998f4E6B9c3d83D5702660c", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
