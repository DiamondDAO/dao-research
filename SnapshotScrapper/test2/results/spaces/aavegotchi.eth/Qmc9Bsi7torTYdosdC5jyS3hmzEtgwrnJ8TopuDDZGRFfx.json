Every anniversary of the launch, Aavegotchi's annual games are held where only Haunt-1 Gotchis can participate \n\n2. Other Haunt Gotchis can participate, but would need a Haunt-1 Fren to partner up with\n\n3. Maybe a very low tax can be imposed to 'partner up' e.g. 0.1 GHST\n\n4. Haunt-1 Gotchis who 'bring the most Frens' could win prizes as well\n\nAnyway, these are just some ideas of what an exclusive Haunt-1 Gotchi event could look like. I am sure, further down the line, the idea could be refined but the gist is there.\n\n\n", "choices": ["YAAASSSSS", "No I dun like this"], "start": 1615003200, "end": 1615348800, "snapshot": "11638833", "state": "closed", "author": "0xf562F49BF62724b1888391Df40cCD34CADf48d29", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
