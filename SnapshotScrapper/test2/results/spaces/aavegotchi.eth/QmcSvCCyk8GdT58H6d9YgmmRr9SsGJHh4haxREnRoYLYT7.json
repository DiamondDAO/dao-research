Not an extra one, just the normal hunt incomming someday.\n\nYou can reserve only 1 Portal in advance and save it for the haunt day. On the hunt day itself, you have the chance to buy this one for sure, and haunt for the others just as we did this time.\n\nYou have 24 hours to claim and buy your reserved Portal. Otherwise there will be the afterhaunt. On the day After, all reserved Portals, who did not get bought, will be sold. It will be done just as a normal hunt. First come, first serve.\nThis way, everybody could get at least one Portal but the first come, first serve base and the excitement, if we got more than one Portal will stay. \n\nI think it's a great idea to allow everybody to buy at least one Portal at haunt day. If you wanna buy more than one, you can do that in the normal, first come, first serve, haunt.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1615028400, "end": 1615633200, "snapshot": "11668472", "state": "closed", "author": "0xDbCA6155C197BD64FeB008d82e95C9c7B58F67e6", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
