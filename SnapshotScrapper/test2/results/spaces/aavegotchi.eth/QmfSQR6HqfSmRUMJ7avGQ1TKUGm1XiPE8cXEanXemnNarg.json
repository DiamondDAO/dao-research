{"id": "QmfSQR6HqfSmRUMJ7avGQ1TKUGm1XiPE8cXEanXemnNarg", "title": "Making the distribution of rarity farming more equal.", "body": "\nThe way the distribution is designed is absolute concentration.  It's  almost impossible to a newbie player reach the top positions of the leaderboard. The first place winner is receiving the vast majority of the prizes and he will stay there practically for ever cause he can reinvest the prizes for getting the best wearables and buying more portals.  How a new player will rise in the ranking to the point of overcoming first place? Impossible! The first place will remain there forever, simply. The difference of prizes between the ranking should be minimal. With minimal prize difference between the leaderboard all NFT gotchi will have a nicer market value, and players could play with more than one gotchis if they want bigger prizes. Right now if you have a low grade aavegotchi you will never sell it, nobody will buy it , and you will never get good prize by rarity.\n\nHow is rarity farming currently being distributed:\nRank 1 - 135828,31 GHST (that`s 15% of all GHST distributed in the pool!! This player will stay here in top 1 for ever !!!)\nRank 2 - 67914.15\nRank 3 - 43942,77\nRank 4 - 31957.08\nRank 5 - 24965.66\nRank 6 - 20071,38\nRank 7 - 17218.33\nRank 8 - 15078.54\nRank 9 - 13414.26\nRank 10 - 12082.83\n...\nRank 500 - 119,83 (almost nothing)\n\nsource:  rarity farming distribution:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13F9VoLHqSX7SgNHaBSa4K-TgoxFBYz2pKLzkEAvdPI0/edit#gid=291463579\n\nSuggestion of a better way to distribute the prizes, avoiding the absolute power of the first places and allowing new players to rise in the ranking. We  also create better market value for all gotchis NFT's:\n\nExample: 1 millon GHST pool for 500 players.\nSuggestion: Sum of weights method: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... + 500 = 125250 shares\nThis way the prize decreases by 8 GHST each position lower\nRank 1 : 3992 GHST (500 shares)\nRank 2 : 3984 GHST (499 shares)\nRank 3 : 3976 GHST (498 shares)\n...\nRank 100 : 3129 GHST (400 shares)\n...\nRank 200 : 2320  GHST (300 shares)\n...\nRank 300: 1520 GHST (200 shares)\n...\nRank 400: 800 GHST (100 shares)\nRank 500: 1  GHST ( 1 share)\n...\n\nThis way ALL NFT aavegotchi will have nice market value!! If you are a whale you can play with two or more gotchis for double gains! The way is designed right now most of the gotchis has no value in the market and will never reach the top spots.
