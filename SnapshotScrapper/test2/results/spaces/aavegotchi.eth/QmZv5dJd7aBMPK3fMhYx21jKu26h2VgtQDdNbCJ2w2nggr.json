NFTs are a big part of the DCL community and will continue to be so as art and collectable NFTs are taking off. The DCL community loves to show off their art and collectable NFTs in the DCL world. Aavegotchi could be apart of this collectable/art scene as well as being apart of Defi etc etc. Potential ideas and options below.\n\n1. Being able to display your Aavegotchi in game like artwork. Similar to Cryptokittes atm. (I believe this should already be able to happen, once our Aavegotchi NFTs are minted)\n\n2. Creating Aavegotchi merch. Wearables, shirts, hats etc or even a hand held Aavegotchi device you can carry? (Has to be approved through DCL DAO etc) \n\n3. Bring 3D models of Aavegotchis into DCL to roam around. There is already 3D models from Axie Infinity and Ethermon roaming around and land in DCL already. Aavegotchi ghosts could do the same, would be great marketing and bring attention to the space.\n\n4. Create an in game store / building to advertise and promote Aavegotchi.\n\n5. Great idea for Aavegotchi, lets create something in DCL\n\n6. No this is not a good idea for Aavegotchi and or isn't possible.", "choices": ["Aavegotchi Artwork in DCL", "Aavegotchi Merch / Wearables in DCL", "3D Aavegotchi models in DCL", "Create in game store / building to promote Aavegotchi", "Great idea for Aavegotchi lets make something happen", "Not good for Aavegotchi or isn't possible"], "start": 1600257600, "end": 1600948800, "snapshot": "10929283", "state": "closed", "author": "0xE3b35E018C8270E335009fB05Adc56cccDF453Ce", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
