Unlike most cryptocurrencies, burning GHST (except via the bonding curve) does not actually lower the total value of GHST, since that value is stored as DAI within the bonding curve. \n\nWhat burning *does* do is trap DAI within the bonding curve, essentially increasing the reserve ratio over time, which stabilizes the price of GHST. \n\nIn order to offset the burning (which could ultimately turn GHST into a stablecoin), **we advise the community to increase the tap to 150,000 DAI per month**. This will help balance the reserve of the bonding curve, while also providing an extra 50,000 DAI per month that can be put towards player rewards and liquidity incentives.\n\nOur recently-announced Rarity Farming player reward bonus of 50,000 GHST is a great example of this, as is the Matic liquidity migration incentive of 50,000 USD we are offering starting January 29.\n\nPlease signal whether or not you support this modification to the Aavegotchi DAICO bonding curve. \n", "choices": ["Increase tap to 150K DAI / month", "Leave it at 100K DAI / month"], "start": 1610337600, "end": 1610942400, "snapshot": "11653277", "state": "closed", "author": "0x027Ffd3c119567e85998f4E6B9c3d83D5702660c", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
