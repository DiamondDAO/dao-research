It is not necessary to collect feedback from community members to understand that most of the early adopters were left without a portal and without a fren. This topic has already been discussed here: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/proposal-for-a-new-haunt-immediately/330\n\nThe second Haunt will be declined by current GHST holders who bought portals. This would be rational behaviour because additional 10000 portals will devalue their portals and aavegotchis. At the same time, rejecting a friend's needs will cause negative feedback from the community and will lower the loyalty of the community. So, the motivation is to let people be engaged in the game and do not devalue the holdings of current holders.\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1614726000, "end": 1614985200, "snapshot": "11531390", "state": "closed", "author": "0xbD6F5BdC401AB1Ca811e40755f4A2ddAd75cE2cc", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
