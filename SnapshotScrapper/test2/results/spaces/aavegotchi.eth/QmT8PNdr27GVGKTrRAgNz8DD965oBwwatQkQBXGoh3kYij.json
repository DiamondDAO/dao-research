They are sold on the market for a penny and no one wants to be frens with them. To give them utilitarian properties, I propose to introduce a new *mechanic* **\"Breeding ghosts\"**.\n\n**Breeding mechanics description**\n\nYou can take two gotchi, combine them and get a new one with random traits in return (the old two gotchi will be sacrificed).\nAlso, traits may not be completely random, but generated based on the traits of the parents. In this way, it will be possible to even create ghosts with the desired traits (but always with random eyes).\nAt the same time, it turns out that not all ghosts are good for each other, for example, a ghost with a **high** energy trait does not fit well with a ghost with a **low** energy trait, since as a result this trait will be averaged.\nWe can also add new \"Generation\" property, which means how many generations of ancestors this ghost had. For this procedure, you can take a commission in $GHST and send it to treasure. The commission can increase with each generation.\n\nThus, we will reduce the number of ordinary ghosts and give them more value, and also there will be another completely new profession for Aavegotchi ecosystem.\n\n**Summary**\n**- Make gotchi with common traits more valuable and add to them new utility function**\n**- Replenishment of the treasury through commissions**\n**- New profession for Aavegotchi masters**\n\n*P.S. This is a general description of the new mechanics, and of course it can be simplified or made more complex.*", "choices": ["Yes, I like the idea", "No we don't need it"], "start": 1615050000, "end": 1616878800, "snapshot": "11680049", "state": "closed", "author": "0x36f26E2E5BED062968c17FC770863FD740713205", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
