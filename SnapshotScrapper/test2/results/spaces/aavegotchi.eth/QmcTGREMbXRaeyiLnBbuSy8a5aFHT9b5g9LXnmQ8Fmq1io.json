People who bought from baazaar at multiples of the launch price will suffer from huge loses too if this were to happen. Therefore I suggest to add something unique like a shiny background for Haunt 1 in order to maintain the \u201climited\u201d component of the initial launch. This will make everyone happy because Haunt 1 buyers will not suffer loses or devaluation of their purchase while more people get to enjoy the game and mass adoption can come true in the future.", "choices": ["Add shiny background or cosmetic", "Leave Haunt 1 as it is"], "start": 1614657600, "end": 1615089600, "snapshot": "11565552", "state": "closed", "author": "0x94a5b840F6898E5178649A2b117B3cE3BB7aA873", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
