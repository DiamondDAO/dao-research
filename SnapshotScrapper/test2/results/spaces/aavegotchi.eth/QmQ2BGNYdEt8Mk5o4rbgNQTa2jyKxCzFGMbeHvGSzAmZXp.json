One would be based strictly on GHST holdings while the other would be based on a one Gotchi-one vote principle.\n\nBecause of the tokenomics of Aavegotchi and the need for risk investment and liquidity, those community members with a lot of skin in the game should have a weighted influence on certain classes of decisions, e.g., those with dilutive or inflationary impact on the Gotchi market.  But there are other classes of community decisions where voting based on Gotchis holdings rather than GHST assets should prevail, for example, decisions involving gameplay rules, haunt procedures, rarity mechanics, etc.\n\nHaving two such voting mechanisms for DAO governance would balance the influence of investors with those of crypto-neophytes, DeFi advocates and gamers. This should help avoid Aavegotchi becoming a niche game solely for high-asset collectibles speculators while promoting an ecosystem that incentivizes game play and community engagement.\n\nOf course, the devil is in the details.  But this DAO Cocoon phase is the perfect time to start evolving such a voting model and identifying which aspects of DAO governance voting should be GHST weighted and which should be Gotchi weighted.", "choices": ["Good Idea", "Bad Idea"], "start": 1615626000, "end": 1616346000, "snapshot": "11957633", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6541E84Af0B25f3e084E9ed17d8f255a12D125d3", "space": {"id": "aavegotchi.eth", "name": "Aavegotchi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
