Some of them are being banned even for simple participation in dialogue on Swerve Discord server.\n\nThis is an unjustifiable mode of censorship that should not be a part of any community within crypto ecosystem. The blockchain ecosystem is built on the core values of openness, transparency and censor-ship resistant participation, both in what goes on on-chain as well as off-chain.\n\nI believe this action of Curve moderators executing unilateral bans on active participants of Swerve community are a significant step back from the core values of the ecosystem.\n# Solution\nCurve team/moderators/community should embrace transparency and criticism. They should stop limiting access to information, putting up barriers to community participation, and shun censorship as a mode of community management.\n\nWhile it would be great if the core team of Curve strives to also bring transparency to their operations, this proposal does not apply to it.\n\n# Proposal\nAs an immediate response to the passing of this proposal this proposal seeks to request the Curve moderators to reverse the bans on members who have been banned for Curve discord simply be committing the crime of participating in discourse on Swerve Discord.\n\nShould the Curve team reverse the bans on users active in Swerve discord?\n\n", "choices": ["Yes - We need to maintain core values!", "No - Continue censorship!"], "start": 1602594000, "end": 1602766800, "snapshot": "11048920", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6D3E136698beFEe231cD2E4E94bE0105D62FA01F", "space": {"id": "curve.eth", "name": "Curve Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
