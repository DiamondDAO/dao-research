Adding a tBTC pool will further increase the liquidity of Bitcoin on Ethereum and make it easier to swap between assets.\n\nAbstract\n\ntBTC is a Bitcoin sidechain on Ethereum, built to give Bitcoin the capabilities of Ethereum and bring additional collateral to DeFi. The asset (TBTC) is an ERC-20 pegged to Bitcoin, it can be minted or redeemed for BTC by anyone and without intermediaries. Instead of relying on a single custodian like wBTC or federation of custodians like Liquid, tBTC is supported by a decentralized bonded multi-federated peg model using ECDSA technology.\n\ntBTC is built on the Keep Network, and as of launching this week already has 24.21M USD locked in the network (22.69M USD in KEEP, 1.39M USD in ETH and 0.26M USD in BTC). We\u2019ve decided to launch slowly and safely with a 9 week graduated cap, currently the cap is at 100 BTC but will rise to 250 later this week. [See the full schedule here](https://blog.keep.network/tbtc-the-safe-way-to-use-bitcoin-in-defi-is-live-on-tbtc-network-de2bb8b6eaf7). Future plans for tBTC include pointing at least 5% of the KEEP supply at various liquidity rewards.\n\nMotivation\n\nWith several BTC on Ethereum choices out there, the tBTC team wants to gauge the Curve community\u2019s appetite for a tBTC pool. Our team\u2019s initial thought was to keep it simple with a tBTC/wBTC pool, but are also interested in hearing about interest in something like a tBTC/[renBTC/wBTC/sBTC] pool.\n\nPlease vote below or submit options for other assets you\u2019d like to see in a pool.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe tBTC contracts just went live: https://etherscan.io/token/0x8dAEBADE922dF735c38C80C7eBD708Af50815fAa\n\ntBTC is fully open source and has been audited by ConsenSys Diligence, Sergei Delgado (an independent BTC researcher) and Trail of Bits. [See audit details](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc#security)\n\nFor\nMore pool options for Bitcoin on Ethereum will bootstrap liquidity as this tokenized Bitcoin grows as a whole.\n\nAgainst\n\nDifferent BTC on Ethereum protocols come with different risk models, liquidity, etc.\n\n", "choices": ["tBTC/wBTC pool", "tBTC/[renBTC/sBTC/wBTC] metapool", "Against"], "start": 1600776000, "end": 1601078340, "snapshot": "10914091", "state": "closed", "author": "0x432317153fb2D2dAce8789c844bf2dB48Fcde257", "space": {"id": "curve.eth", "name": "Curve Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
