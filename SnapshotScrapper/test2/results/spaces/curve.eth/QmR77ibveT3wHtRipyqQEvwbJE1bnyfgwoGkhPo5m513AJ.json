Its market capitalization has grown to over $65 million in the ~2 months since its inception (peaked near $100 million).\n\nThe unique mechanism design of the protocol makes it a strong candidate to become one of the largest stable collateral assets in the decentralized finance ecosystem.\n\nCreating an ESD metapool would attract more liquidity to the Curve platform and lead to increased trading fees.\n\nLearn more about metapools here: https://resources.curve.fi/faq/base-and-metapools 1\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nEmpty Set Dollar (ESD) is a new algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin that utilizes fixed protocol rules on supply expansion as well as a unique coupon creation + redemption model to incentivize trustless coordination between selfish participants that maintain ESD\u2019s synthetic peg 1:1 with the US dollar all on-chain. Unlike other algorithmic stable coins like AMPL, ESD does not rebase all balances using non-standard functions, but instead adjusts supply through other mechanisms, allowing ESD to have the same composability as other standard ERC20 tokens.\n\nCurrently, crypto lacks a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant stablecoin. While DAI and sUSD come close, they currently have vulnerabilities in their architecture. The goal of ESD is to create a truly permissionless, scaleable, stable store of value, that can be used as superfluid collateral in DeFi.\n\nNote: ESD currently only incentivizes the ESD/USDC Uniswap pool. In order to motivate more liquidity to flow to this Curve metapool, ESD holders would have to vote to upgrade ESD to incentivize this new pool. However, various ESD community members have already expressed their support for such a prospective proposal to reward Curve LPs.\n\n*Liquidity:*\n\nTotal Uniswap Liquidity as of 11/3/2020: $1.52 million\n\nAvg. Daily Trading Volume (Last 14 Days ended 11/3/2020): $3.75 million\n\n*Token Holder Distribution:*\n\nAs of 11/4/2020 there are currently over 853 unique addresses holding ESD. This includes 668 staked addresses.\n\nOver 90% of ESD tokens were staked to the DAO as of 11/3/2020.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThis is an opportunity for Curve to attract more liquidity to its platform and increase trading fees. It would also benefit the ESD community by increasing the efficiency of ESD turnover and accelerating ESD contraction & expansion cycles to further stabilize the price of the token around $1. Finally, accelerating the growth of ESD would enhance the antifragility of the entire DeFi ecosystem due to ESD\u2019s unique characteristics relative to other stable assets.\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThis metapool would include ESD, USDC, USDT, and DAI. It is likely that the ESD protocol community would vote to incentivize this Curve metapool. It already does this for the ESD/USDC pool on Uniswap: https://emptyset.finance/#/pool/\n\n**For:**\n\nThis pool would bring more liquidity and fees to the Curve protocol.\n\nIt would also help accelerate and dampen the volatility ESD\u2019s expansion/contraction cycles, which are currently delayed due to the limitations of slippage on the ESD/USDC Uniswap pool.\n\nSuccessful passage of this proposal would show the Curve community\u2019s willingness to support new, innovative protocols \u2013 specifically those focused on open and permissionless access to DeFi.\n\n**Against:**\n\nESD is a relatively new and experimental protocol. There are both known and unknown risks to explore as the protocol matures. These include, but are not limited to:\n\nESD is expected to trade within a narrow band around US$1.00, but has experienced short periods of significant volatility\n\nA downward spiral in the instance of zero demand for new coupons (though in the current contraction period, over 26m coupons have been purchased)\n\nSmart contract bugs (code is currently under audit); and\n\nA design flaw that leads to an economic attack (see the recent Harvest Finance attack 1).\n\n**Primary Resources:**\n\n-Whitepaper: https://github.com/emptysetsquad/dollar/blob/master/d\u00f8llar.pdf 1\n\nWebsite: https://emptyset.finance/#/ 1\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/emptysetsquad\nSource Code: https://github.com/emptysetsquad/dollar\nESD token contract: https://etherscan.io/token/0x36f3fd68e7325a35eb768f1aedaae9ea0689d723\nEIPs: https://www.emptyset.xyz/t/eip-1-improvements-to-esd-coupon-redemption/32\nMedium: https://medium.com/@emptysetsquad 1\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/vPws9Vp\nAdditional Resources:\n\nhttps://medium.com/@lewisfreiberg/empty-set-dollar-esd-a0abbfc5ecdb\nO\u2019ligopoly Productions Writeup\nDefi Weekly Writeup by Kerman Kohli\nesd.tools (dashboard for tracking the state of the network)\nhttps://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/empty-set-dollar 1", "choices": ["Yes, add ESD Metapool", "o"], "start": 1604664000, "end": 1605268800, "snapshot": "11205930", "state": "closed", "author": "0x76B687cF4E5a4e73Fa3950D6cC642bCC64e40B88", "space": {"id": "curve.eth", "name": "Curve Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
