By allowing users to directly lock, this is avoided, and the net profitability of staking is higher for all impacted LPs. This should lead to more locked up CRV, less sell pressure on CRV, and merriment and good times for all.\n\nThis would improve quality of life for many users and should prove supporting of the CRV token price. It enables giving less money to Uncle Sam and his friends. Gas and time would be saved in the standard claim to vote-lock flow.\n\nIn terms of implementation, I think a checkbox next to the claim button is simplest, but I defer to the eng team on what aligns with their UI/UX look and feel.\n\nRead more and discuss: https://gov.curve.fi/t/discussion-claim-straight-to-vecrv/806", "choices": ["Yes, add ability to claim straight to veCRV", "No, do not allow direct lockign of CRV"], "start": 1600430400, "end": 1600776000, "snapshot": "10886954", "state": "closed", "author": "0xD4c80637F45A55b5e1aFa9cD0c935395063d4523", "space": {"id": "curve.eth", "name": "Curve Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
