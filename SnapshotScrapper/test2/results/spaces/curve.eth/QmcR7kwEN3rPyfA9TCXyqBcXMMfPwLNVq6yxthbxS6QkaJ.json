The gauge would be introduced at 0 allocation.\n\nThe gauge would have a 50% admin fee on Uniswap profits which means 50% of profits would be collected by the DAO and distributed to veCRV holders on withdrawal. If there were no profits, the withdrawal fee will be free.\n\n", "choices": ["For", "Against (wait for crypto pools on Curve)"], "start": 1600934400, "end": 1601244000, "snapshot": "10924472", "state": "closed", "author": "0x052C60CEd52C7fD4Ac01FcCF0349CC495E3A2318", "space": {"id": "curve.eth", "name": "Curve Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
