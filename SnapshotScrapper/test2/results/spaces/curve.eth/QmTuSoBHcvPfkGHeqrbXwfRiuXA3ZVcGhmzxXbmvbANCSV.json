Those three type of grants have the common goal of encouraging and developing the Curve ecosystem and empowering the community.\n\nWe are proposing to trial those grants for four months and this proposal seeks to approve the council as well as the budget for it. A new vote four months from now will give a chance to the council to demonstrate results and the DAO to reconsider the budget and/or put an end to those grants.\n\nAfter discussions with other DeFi protocols, we strongly believe those grants have the potential to have long last benefit for Curve and its ecosystem.\n\nRead here: https://gov.curve.fi/t/scip-3-introducing-ecosystem-and-community-grants-and-a-curve-council/985", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1603008000, "end": 1603285200, "snapshot": "11079333", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6ab615CF8deCFc488186E54066Fc10589C9293A3", "space": {"id": "curve.eth", "name": "Curve Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
