The mBTC token can be minted with wBTC, RenBTC and sBTC, and you can redeem it for those three Bitcoin tokens. mAssets benefit from capped risk, with max-weights and an incoming insurance policy provided by the system token MTA. mBTC would be the second mAsset with a Metapool on Curve, with the [mUSD, [3Pool]] having been an active and relatively high yielding pool over the past few months ([https://www.curve.fi/musd](https://www.curve.fi/musd)), with multiple active derivatives on yEarn.\n\n\n**Motivation**\n\nmBTC has been launched for 3 weeks, and has been seeing consistent demand since launch which is set to continue as the system matures. There is an exponentially increasing TVL cap, which is set to expire after 7 full weeks (source: Dune [https://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/mbtc](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/mbtc)).\n\nWhile there is demand, there are a lack of liquid/efficient markets for mBTC. Having mBTC listed on Curve would provide mStable users with an on-ramp and provide the following for Curve users:\n\n- Another option for yield seekers on Curve\n- Increased revenue for sBTC LP holders from a meta pool with a positive growth trajectory\n- Increased fee revenue for veCRV holders\n\n**Useful links**\n\n- Official:\u00a0[https://mstable.org/](https://mstable.org/)\n- Code:\u00a0[https://github.com/mstable/mstable-contracts](https://github.com/mstable/mstable-contracts)\n- mBTC contract: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x945Facb997494CC2570096c74b5F66A3507330a1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x945Facb997494CC2570096c74b5F66A3507330a1)\n- Documentation:\u00a0[https://docs.mstable.org/](https://docs.mstable.org/)\n- Forum:\u00a0[https://forum.mstable.org/](https://forum.mstable.org/)\n- Dune analytics: [https://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/mbtc](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/mbtc)", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1614888000, "end": 1615492800, "snapshot": "11973208", "state": "closed", "author": "0x0C2eF8a1b3Bc00Bf676053732F31a67ebbA5bD81", "space": {"id": "curve.eth", "name": "Curve Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
