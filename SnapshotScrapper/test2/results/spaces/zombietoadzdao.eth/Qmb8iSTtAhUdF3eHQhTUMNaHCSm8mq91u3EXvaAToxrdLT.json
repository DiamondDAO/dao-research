I'm calling for a vote to increase our OpenSea royalty which will go directly into the DAO treasury and allow us to expedite our purchases, and consequently strengthen our project considerably. \n\nThe current royalty split is 7.5%: 2.5% to OpenSea, 2.5% for continued development, and 2.5% for the DAO.\n\nVote options:\n1: Increase royalties by 5% to buy more CryptToadz and other Blue Chips-12.5% total\n2: Increase royalties by 2.5% to buy more CryptToadz and other Blue Chips-10% total\n3: Don't increase royalties to buy more CryptToadz and other Blue Chips-remains at 7.5%\n\nRemember:  100% of royalty increase comes back to long term holders in the form of fractionalized $Brainz tokens.
