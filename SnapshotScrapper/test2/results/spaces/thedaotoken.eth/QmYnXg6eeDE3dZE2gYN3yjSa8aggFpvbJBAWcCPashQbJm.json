Accept any donations (if any?) that come from https://thedaotoken.eth.link front-end  \n\n3. Decide how donations are to be spent\n\n4. Each transaction should only be completed only with the approval of a voting majority.\n\n(The front-end is deployed at https://thedaotoken.eth.link)\n\nSo, this is just a fun experiment for now. 0xTyccon, who founded \"The DAO Museum\", also acquired the thedaotoken.eth domain name and placed it under a multi-sig to co-own with other DAO token collector-enthusiasts.\nIt would also be interesting to use the DAO tokens for voting, and it seems like this Snapshot page allows us to do so!\n\nTherefore here is the first proposal:\n\"Should we add Griff Green, address griff.eth, (@thegrifft on Twitter), to the multi-sig\" ?\n\nGriff is the person who offered a bounty to update the instructions to TheDAO Withdrawal process and got 0xTycoon motivated to complete \"TheDAO museum\" project, which includes a modern web3 UI for TheDAO Withdrawals, including the extra balances\". (Needless to say after completing the project,, 0xTycoon claimed the bounty, paid in 20 DAO tokens from Griff, of course)\n\nCurrent multi-sig participants:\ntycoon.eth - founded this \"The DAO Museum\"  project\nbokkypoobah.eth - helped out 0xTycoon with some questions he had. Also helped numerous people with TheDAO withdrawals over the years, including maintaining the instructions.\ncodeislaw.eth  - donated the thedaotoken.eth domain domain, also setup the snapshot page initially.\n\nThe current multisig is a 2/3. With the inclusion of Giff, it would become 2/4.\n\nHappy voting!
