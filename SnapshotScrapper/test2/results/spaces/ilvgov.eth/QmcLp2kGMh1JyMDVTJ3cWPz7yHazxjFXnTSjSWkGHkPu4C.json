Each Illuvatar can be used across all games, as long as you link your account to\nthe wallet that owns the NFT.\nThe intention with Illuvatars is to allow for a perfect mix of randomness and rarity (via\nconfigurable attributes that are interchangeable), and availability via high-quality base\nportraits that anyone can purchase for a reasonable fee.\n\n## Abstract\nCreate avatars for users in the Illuvium universe.\n\n## Overview \n\n### Illuvatar Components\n\nEach Illuvatar is composed of two distinct parts which combine together to make the final\nimage. This image can be made up of many NFTs as we allow one NFT component per\naccessory category.\n\n### Minting\n\nFans can mint an infinite number of random base layer Illuvatars. These will be sold for a\nfixed price, with the ability to boost your chances of minting higher-tier illuvatars by adding\nan additional fee.\n\n### Sets\n\nEach set is available for a limited time. Once a new set is released the previous will never be\navailable for purchase again, unless from another user on the IlluviDEX.\n\n### Base Illuvatars - set 1\nTBD\n\n### Base Illuvatar Pricing\n[Pricing Image in Github](https://github.com/IlluviumGame/IIPs/blob/master/assets/iip-13/illuvatar-price.png)\n\n### Accessory Types\n* Head\n* Eyes\n* Body\n* Mouth\n\n### Accessory Pricing\n[Pricing Image in Github](https://github.com/IlluviumGame/IIPs/blob/master/assets/iip-13/accessory-price.png)\n\nBoth sILV and ETH can be used and the final price is subject to approval from the council\nbefore the sale date.\nIlluvatars and accessories will be sold in the IlluviDEX and act as the first method by which\nthese base layers can be bought.\n\n### Bonding\nOnce an accessory has been bonded to an Illuvatar it is permanent and can no longer be\nremoved.\n\n### Badges\nBadges from the Balancer Sale can also be fitted to an Illuvatar, however, these are not\nbonded and can be removed at any time.\n\n## Rationale\nIlluvatars is a fun way of giving players their own unique identity in the Illuvium Universe. The\nrevenue generated from the sale will go into the Illuvium vault to be distributed to stakers in\nthe protocol.\n\n## Test Cases\nCrypto punks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Cool Cats.", "choices": ["Accept", "Decline"], "start": 1634608800, "end": 1634868000, "snapshot": "13445301", "state": "closed", "author": "0x0691f5804d4227925F19b031821b530b48FFf38f", "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth", "name": "Illuvinati Governance"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPrnNcBQRMgZjYBdRumZndKDJZUg9C4CieC8YTZesaTVK", "voter": "0xD1a3D55809E900E94c15754cBaD4b7F31bD47Df5", "created": 1634859453, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVZ2YP5iyQvLCEsZKNx2eNAR37LeP3KiXRpqBsYtNN8yo", "voter": "0x906E55e1035C8a0828F249C173D8090e8Fd5f189", "created": 1634857613, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVbQ2BCWEM1RqwZvUJvTGB5TcCVNEqv2op2euYFqh7oUa", "voter": "0x9Bb3D4cC7251FA56440E0145162319FCFECCF975", "created": 1634827635, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRS7Vk8NLV1eAbpFiD8fikcmYnRPoDFwV3TM3LmjyXvJu", "voter": "0xE5CA795F807033335C18E0b4BeF87c8AE0ec008b", "created": 1634748721, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth"}}]}
