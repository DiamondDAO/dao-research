This has seen a large portion of LP\u2019s move their SLP tokens, and as such there is an opportunity for the treasury to begin staking in the Sushi ETH/ILV pool. At the time of writing, the pool is offering 230 Sushi rewards per day. A separate IIP should outline what the treasury does with these $SUSHI rewards. A suggestion would be for giveaways and competitions within the Illuvium Discord. \n\n\n## Rationale\n\nIt makes more sense for ILV holders to stake into Illuvium pools as the APY % in that pool is much higher. Because of this, the Illuvium treasury should capitalize on the potential rewards from the Sushi pool while ILV token holders stake into the Illuvium pool.\n\nThere are many potential uses for these $SUSHI tokens, and the DAO should always be looking to find ways to benefit the token holders.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nN/A", "choices": ["Accept", "Decline"], "start": 1625698800, "end": 1625958000, "snapshot": "12782550", "state": "closed", "author": "0x0691f5804d4227925F19b031821b530b48FFf38f", "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth", "name": "Illuvinati Governance"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmeHU8Bp9LFZBnoejhPuNiXdM2W6mz7fWBQwDE5YPqmo4g", "voter": "0x796F2f1f3dD42d8ACfB03aEc7134aA14A84bA268", "created": 1625901102, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNYycMsy2EXoFUmyL9FozG9Qjkybk1ar8r88oHNoTMgQo", "voter": "0x8f2CF9e24fb1938a693e4B2d4fF3a64E47Ba2ED8", "created": 1625891717, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXaxF7dUCUvJQoVzPSPwYLuwk7grfdUPZXnCvXdgT2SsK", "voter": "0xD1a3D55809E900E94c15754cBaD4b7F31bD47Df5", "created": 1625890433, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth"}}]}
