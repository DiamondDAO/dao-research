Therefore, they represent tokens that the DAO feels would make beneficial staking pools in the best interests of the DAO.\n\n## Rationale\nFlash pools have the ability to generate a number of new token holders from strong communities. While we work towards open beta it is critical that the DAO continues to gain exposure, and offering yield to solid projects assists with that. \n\nThe five tokens currently nominated are:\n\n* SUPER (Superfarm) - DeFi NFT protocol (We are presently working with Superfarm to provide an opportunity for ILV token holders to be able to stake on the Superfarm platform to farm NFTs.)\n\n* SUSHI (Sushi) - Swap, earn, stack yields, lend, borrow, leverage all on one decentralized, community-driven platform (Longterm partners of Illuvium, currently our largest trading exchange)\n\n* ENJ (Enjin) - Products that make it easy for individuals, businesses, and brands to use non-fungible tokens of the future. (Huge gaming ecosystem with over 100,000 token holders)\n\n* MVI (Metaverse Index) - Metaverse token (Large investors in Illuvium, recently listed our token as the second-largest holding within their gaming index)\n\n* LINK (Chainlink) - Oracle solution (Active community that strongly endorses partner initiatives)\n\n* Continue the Flash Pool pause\n\n## Test Cases\n[IIP-008: Council Vote for 4th Flash Pool](https://gov.illuvium.io/#/ilvgov.eth/proposal/QmSaA4Mv4nvkL6pHVmsXD86BechEZcFDtP2moqwyP7cTvf)", "choices": ["SUPER", "SUSHI", "ENJ", "MVI", "LINK", "Continue the Flash Pool Pause"], "start": 1632142800, "end": 1632402000, "snapshot": "13262664", "state": "closed", "author": "0x0691f5804d4227925F19b031821b530b48FFf38f", "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth", "name": "Illuvinati Governance"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmcKiYjNU3SCRKEdoS582ayZZaiuQBPPyMjNrbJidUk4FC", "voter": "0xD1a3D55809E900E94c15754cBaD4b7F31bD47Df5", "created": 1632370698, "choice": 5, "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPkKWhRCAWUNCPhmysRT1i88w2dFEX7GKUuTSyEDMWLVP", "voter": "0x9Bb3D4cC7251FA56440E0145162319FCFECCF975", "created": 1632347849, "choice": 5, "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcGt2KrVSz4hssceK1MWcYj71dF84bBdeKyUhSDsfHTBP", "voter": "0x906E55e1035C8a0828F249C173D8090e8Fd5f189", "created": 1632253600, "choice": 5, "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeTnc2PCW52TQAi9pNHUkEXKm3xKgPwkbb7dYeJfmt8T1", "voter": "0xE5CA795F807033335C18E0b4BeF87c8AE0ec008b", "created": 1632249318, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth"}}]}
