Once complete, token XYZ will be the first Flash Pool v2 deployed.\n\n## Overview\nIlluvium core devs have found a limitation in the existing Flash Pools contract due to\nan issue with precision, and tokens with extremely large supply cant be launched.\nFor this reason, I am suggesting we launch the AXS Flash Pool utilizing the audited\nv1 contract. Once audited, the XYZ token would become the first Flash Pool v2.\nPreceding this would be a fortnightly council vote that includes multiple tokens of\ninterest that have been discussed in the Illuvium Governance channel within Discord.\n \n## Rationale\nFlash Pools are a great marketing tool, and the above solution allows us to safely\ncontinue launching v1 pools while waiting for the v2 contract to be audited. Delaying\nFlash Pools further may negatively impact the community and doesn\u2019t seem\nnecessary given the workaround above.\n\n### Test Cases\nN/A\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n", "choices": ["Accept", "Decline"], "start": 1626987600, "end": 1627246800, "snapshot": "12878429", "state": "closed", "author": "0x0691f5804d4227925F19b031821b530b48FFf38f", "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth", "name": "Illuvinati Governance"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXByaMDmg3qMq3jYRA8T9sRdiZP7kLYhgUcsXQqftsuuU", "voter": "0xD1a3D55809E900E94c15754cBaD4b7F31bD47Df5", "created": 1627004297, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYDyQwJkQ1n7ksLE37oDJg5YZxZiFpRBS6LsNBfnweY4k", "voter": "0x8f2CF9e24fb1938a693e4B2d4fF3a64E47Ba2ED8", "created": 1626987764, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme1bog3A12yeo9HxLMJZtuuWiZb7i7DM5iQQqTKv4tVn6", "voter": "0x796F2f1f3dD42d8ACfB03aEc7134aA14A84bA268", "created": 1626987616, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ilvgov.eth"}}]}
