Minting vs purchasing on secondary will have upcoming advantages still to be clarified by PV team (confirmed by GFunk, founder and head of PV/MH). A Jupiter DAO token will give DoorDAO a voting share for Jupiter's DAO when it comes to governance for Planet revenues and game development. The Jupiter DAO token also comes with a redeemable mint pass for a Sidekick Metahero, which hopefully will make the minting cost worth it by itself. I propose this to give DoorDAO exposure to, in many's (and my) view, a top 3 team in this space. Pixel Vault has hired the same top tier law firm that created the SuperRare DAO to create the Metahero Universe's Planet DAOs, UPDAO (United Planet's DAO that all Planet DAOs will have a say in) and the Intergalactic Bylaws. They continue to over deliver and have signed with WME who will help them form partnerships and deals with top companies in the gaming & entertainment industry to capitalize on their IP.", "choices": ["Yes", "No", "Abstain"], "start": 1633557600, "end": 1633644000, "snapshot": "13367969", "state": "closed", "author": "0xF4CdfeA7fdF85872141e4f8EB0E953427De7626f", "space": {"id": "doorknock.eth", "name": "DoorDAO"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXT5V4Sv1vHfTkdJkuMyN9bVRLuY8UANdQcNoZWhANFqu", "voter": "0x9127c9221b22EA3789c90383284C72dCd7d9B9FB", "created": 1633627945, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "doorknock.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYT8LdHv6f5bjuMFZMuTfe2y2xjUNyP5X3b7tNnCWoQv1", "voter": "0xF3Dc235FF7025CEF31e76c65C7fa7151f3343874", "created": 1633626095, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "doorknock.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWZqcNRX3UtmFbv3wsWzLqmWbA1nmCEtmCAsQQ4KRAybv", "voter": "0xAb7c1F9fDA768895E5d5bC3fE23391DdC5D96Df5", "created": 1633606184, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "doorknock.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVRbPqdpfpzrCvtJCSkLinTZj7FkjkmEhtj9CRKUwG4Xp", "voter": "0xFe917312344B4ed3283C5e142868cd3EAa782933", "created": 1633564882, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "doorknock.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXM3DfMHZS1rE8D13Hk7TCF8meZKkE2Tf4fAb6puLRADE", "voter": "0x363e89408093719f67b7a674B74006989442116A", "created": 1633561236, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "doorknock.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdTpyJuY1XRnmuda5f66wud8mVtB13GVJBEtUz5tEKr4e", "voter": "0x648a6E076f8231649f23f07E41BFF5464aFdd31d", "created": 1633558617, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "doorknock.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY5x5LcbRDerHaFBDq1tMShTFHW2rzabPxytVBtzCuAVx", "voter": "0x0cE1e7CAFE72B4d48de78a2593d9f251345aE740", "created": 1633557883, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "doorknock.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme32UepPmYdUNM7anMshknh7mqzZtGT2foVBYajFu5Z6p", "voter": "0x28b8d4f7516a112E2E2FD462293a1C27CdE327a7", "created": 1633557852, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "doorknock.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeiT6D31LXMuzhfRHTp8VRqMVzKcnAmEkVWmMbSWpq8qt", "voter": "0xF4CdfeA7fdF85872141e4f8EB0E953427De7626f", "created": 1633557750, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "doorknock.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT85SBW5aHRGdcAVXHt4kqTx3Yxf4K69Xb8tFpV8tcDPq", "voter": "0x2eE0485f71764bcD2062A84d9455688c581B90f8", "created": 1633557725, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "doorknock.eth"}}]}
