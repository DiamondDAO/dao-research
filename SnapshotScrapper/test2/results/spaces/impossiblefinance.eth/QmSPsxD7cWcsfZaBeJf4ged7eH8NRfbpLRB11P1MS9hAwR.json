For clarity, a community member or a Council member (as defined below) may create and submit a proposal, subject to the mentioned processes.\n1.3 Any vote on a proposal will occur on Snapshot, or a similar gas-less and wallet-based voting platform that aims to promote fairness and access among voting community members.\n1.3.1 Voting on GEPs will be deemed to take place in the \u201cImpossible Town Hall\u201d on Snapshot.\n1.3.2 Voting on IFIPs will be deemed to take place in the \u201cImpossible Chamber\u201d on Snapshot.\n\n_2 What is the Council?_\n2.1 The Council has duties to represent, protect, and further the interests of the IF community by:\n2.1.1 creating, developing, investigating, interviewing, debating, and deliberating about / on proposals and related matters;\n2.1.2 coordinating protocol changes with the DAO and hosting periodic community governance meeting; and\n2.1.3 ensuring prompt and proper execution of validly approved and adopted proposals.\nthese activities are collectively known as the \u201cCouncil activities\u201d.\n2.2 To seek proper advice on and assistance in the execution of Council activities, the Council is authorized to:\n2.2.1 set up, delegate to, and manage committees, task forces, and working groups (collectively, \u201cIF Team\u201d); and\n2.2.2 instruct, procure, and engage the services of relevantly qualified and experienced consultants, professional firms, and vendors (collectively, \u201cContractors\u201d).\n2.3 The Council comprises three (3) members, each serving a term of 12 months (\u201cTerm\u201d).\n2.4 The number of Council member seats can be modified via a GEP.\n\n_3 How does a Council elect ion take place?_\n3.1 An election will be held to fill a Council member seat when the seat becomes vacant because the member has:\n3.1.1 served a full Term;\n3.1.2 resigned and vacated the seat;\n3.1.3 been voted out by a GEP.\n3.2 The Council will set an election period and notify the community 1 to 7 days before the election period begins.\n3.3 The Council will set a nomination period, and invite the IF community to nominate and stand for election before the nomination period ends.\n3.4 Any community member or incumbent Council member is entitled to nominate any member of the IF community to stand for election. For clarity, a past or incumbent Council member can re-stand for election provided that the member is duly nominated.\n3.5 The Council will submit the nominated candidates as GEPs for the IF community to vote on.\n3.6 The three (3) highest vote weights will be elected to the Council.\n\n_4 Are Council Members compensated ?_\n4.1 Council members, like other DAO roles, may be paid a stipend by the DAO to conduct their duties on the relevant governance channels.\n4.2 The stipend level and conditions are to be approved by GEP and are reviewed from time to time.\n\n_5 How is a vote to elect a Council member or pass a GEP validated?_\n5.1 A community member can propose or second a proposal or vote if the member has staked any amount to the IF protocol.\n5.2 A proposal in the Impossible Town Hall is open for voting when it is submitted and passed to Snapshot by the IF Team .\n5.3 The DAO assigns a voting member a vote with which the member can cast votes in the election or voting period, as the case may be.\n5.4 A proposal in the Impossible Town Hall passes validly if 3% or more of the issued IF token holdings in circulation participate in the election or voting period, as the case may be.\n\n_6 How would the Council vote on IFIPs?_\n6.1 The Council members will vote directly on IFIPs under these conditions:\n6.1.1 One vote per each Council member, using Snapshot\u2019s IPFS signature voting on the staking governance site.\n6.1.2 If the composition of the council changes during a proposal it is invalidated if it would have changed the result.\n6.1.3 Each proposal requires a minimum of two (2) affirmative votes to pass.\n6.1.4 The DAO can require a re-vote at its own discretion.\n\n_7 How could this and other governance documents be amended in the future?_\n7.1 As circumstances change, the community may need to adapt this and other governance documents.\n7.2 For clarity, this document is a GEP. It is approved by ratification via the required process, and may similarly be modified by a subsequent GEP approved in the requisite manner.", "choices": ["Adopt", "Reject"], "start": 1625929200, "end": 1626188400, "snapshot": "9000001", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5b3Ed6068d0a16BB008d4F10d10f9f6EB84672A5", "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth", "name": "Impossible Finance"}, "votes": 14, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmcGUK9cjMSXyMD9ydQcdExgsepn9j2Rw3fgBbpVpt379w", "voter": "0x2eB5fB4433b927aCB14d2716B71FAC933B9C6f1c", "created": 1626173505, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbpZ2MkfSRmihiUmL7V5B6oL8o5jS3QuhuDDutC2wc2eY", "voter": "0xcCa94eB1cd3d5bEd6E55920B986d640a97f9D1B2", "created": 1626168016, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYkct1716Bc1h7JEoUvXfRXxjPzWeKxyNPPeRJ8uXowDh", "voter": "0xEEe3DDfd4B8d44975FE89F1d8477925c9b59719e", "created": 1626161503, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUxcceUu4FmPyd8uqcJ5FXex7eBfcFWkjNuuvgVtJ2Dyv", "voter": "0x79F1C58c7b1b315883400928A0306b54919777Da", "created": 1626157807, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdjogTEWpg6ZLHAdvsDET38TixG1KQwkvLJEcC6X4f164", "voter": "0x0019Ed9bb6902105306Fce5A55dc823abb2F74e5", "created": 1626138370, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd5zRGrmNR45raS7adD5smQAiS4ULS97BcLmn9auMWop4", "voter": "0xa5feaf25207398C8Daa3d3f340B88fbcCeb9278F", "created": 1626122355, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTtAePoWsLB2MtZPhUxjFxox3aVkpNk1hTZCFww55MpGq", "voter": "0x7dDFed2fDA8D01c3f11Cf1c143F063521e7ee469", "created": 1626106604, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXggDTeimv3LU7fwqwKbmHgGzs4Ts8yKoyL6ofKQRkLmK", "voter": "0x3C9584426432eb851e5689230d5cFc50659103D5", "created": 1626098872, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRML5XXtEbsCQWNdCssgJEhNcTU7EeQ7CxRoMd1DmBQtr", "voter": "0xA499F225b1F0BB1c747CaA1968386E349a2C3484", "created": 1626097433, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS4BA877MTiYZU6rotq4C9qSpD56FHqnpWQyeHZvR1wqu", "voter": "0x5604B4bc94d768b44f429c5B62Ac5F128D3B061f", "created": 1626090709, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfMYd8pFhgiRhtTQ5Bbv6Jifm7L4HJQ5oJ44eg3bBPnDi", "voter": "0x89367d73349446681199064083d249426F4150Ce", "created": 1626089901, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWPxUuPn5sseoxBNeyFCbHGyjihBnon2iHYQcsrtsHbwS", "voter": "0x55c3920F6678586570B378E04f7B06CC11009fa7", "created": 1626089274, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme3iieHi2oEPF78iy1EUqQaTwH5d2sfkS1xWogQs6vMhv", "voter": "0x0596024675F53ff2EeE6B5771CBCC41F477c2d1F", "created": 1626058324, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV8m2NEWY3i3pcsgks8Ar79FVcz2rMxG1MmGStSQBPSoK", "voter": "0x1a20D18C356E26f34DD07F909e4Cf6b42A69beD2", "created": 1626033366, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "impossiblefinance.eth"}}]}
