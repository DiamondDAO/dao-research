In the upgraded Haze Finance, there will be two major changes taking place :\n\n1. Volume Mining\n2. DEPT\nFor more details regarding these two newly added features please refer to this Medium article here:\nhttps://hazefinance.medium.com/introducing-haze-finance-2-0-worlds-first-decentralized-privacy-tokens-protocol-f04a3e7898a1\n\nSince this is quite a lot of changes, the upgrade will be split into two parts, first Volume Mining, then DEPT. So this governance proposal is ONLY voting for whether or not to pass Volume Mining, not for the passing of DEPT (DEPT voting will take place in a separate governance proposal).\n\nAnd here are the proposal details:\n\nI propose to finish the entire Volume Mining in the duration of 4 years. In order to do this, Haze Finance team will have to increase the current max HAZE supply. Currently, it is capped the HAZE tokens supply at 1 million tokens maximum, which is not enough for Volume Mining. Therefore the Haze team will have to mint more HAZE tokens. \n\nI understand some of you don\u2019t like to increase the max supply because you think the value of what you hold will decrease... really? It\u2019s been like a dead for more than a month, and the price/value is not going anywhere; stuck at the dead bottom.\n\nWhat we need to do now is change the momentum by attracting a lot more people to the mining, then the protocol will be able to payout the rewards to the staking which will bring more people!\n\nSince I decided to make a proposal and try to give a kick start to our Haze project, I carefully thought how much extra mint would be good to attract more people weather the Haze price low like now (not many participants) or high (a lot more participants) in the future.\n\nHere are the options for Haze community members to choose from:\n\n1. No, don't do Volume Mining\n\n2. Yes, mint 5 million extra HAZE (this means Volume Mining will give out 3425 HAZE per day as rewards)\n\nThank you all.", "choices": ["No, don't do Volume Mining", "Yes, mint extra 5 million Haze"], "start": 1620932400, "end": 1621191600, "snapshot": "7360241", "state": "closed", "author": "0xA8D186de7492bE5c1a91895A63C6CF478f80f45a", "space": {"id": "haze.eth", "name": "Haze Finance"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRvPeGPf6UNfFDeGvvf3nonEi8uhEanKcVm637w5FFcwD", "voter": "0xA8D186de7492bE5c1a91895A63C6CF478f80f45a", "created": 1621088797, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "haze.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdmpBu4WZJwu6fEvNP1UhYfsRnN59s7TkFPYfZHRm1GoU", "voter": "0x8412FE38E661CeeE14C176CA806b42AEA364652F", "created": 1621068435, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "haze.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbskspKVyDHKmxtTzvoceKMnGwziDUy5CEm1L63cd2Zz4", "voter": "0xCFdD6Cb5AeA4C6DA545EfE9201BC8c3aE959aA79", "created": 1621003303, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "haze.eth"}}, {"id": "QmegtHmWrksHFfqsp112e3tft1zwxCc7P8p1tvpoxjFHDj", "voter": "0x2378aB91b5Cdc31E29Ce4226969074302Be4D39F", "created": 1620999632, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "haze.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQEFfUkTxkaLwhRaPZBcpwuZ37ipNafUgoNy3dR6sYWXN", "voter": "0xF078c76cC26451EF3Ed6a7210762ac90570710BC", "created": 1620960415, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "haze.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZHAgrnaLZfXd4c7NDisAP7wVFBXHvUuY4bdyUn24PA34", "voter": "0x597EA2BC201e2fca855218Dc057Cb6126236c5c3", "created": 1620955166, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "haze.eth"}}]}
