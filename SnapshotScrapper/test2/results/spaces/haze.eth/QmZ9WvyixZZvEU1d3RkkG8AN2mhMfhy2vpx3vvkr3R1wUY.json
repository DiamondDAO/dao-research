In the upgraded Haze Finance, there will be two major changes taking place :\n1. Volume Mining\n2. DEPT\nFor more details regarding these two newly added features please refer to this Medium article here: \nhttps://hazefinance.medium.com/introducing-haze-finance-2-0-worlds-first-decentralized-privacy-tokens-protocol-f04a3e7898a1\n\nSince this is quite a lot of changes, the upgrade will be split into two parts, first Volume Mining, then DEPT. So this governance proposal is ONLY voting for whether or not to pass Volume Mining, not for the passing of DEPT  (DEPT voting will take place in a separate governance proposal). \n\nAnd here are the proposal details:\nWe propose to finish the entire Volume Mining in the duration of 4 years. In order to do this, we will have to increase the current max HAZE supply. Currently, we capped the HAZE tokens supply at 1 million tokens maximum, which is not enough for Volume Mining. Therefore we will have to mint more HAZE tokens. Here are a few options for Haze community members to choose from\n\n1. No, don't do Volume Mining\n\n2. Yes mint 1 million extra HAZE (this means Volume Mining will give out 684 HAZE per day as rewards)\n\n3. Yes, mint 2 million extra HAZE (this means Volume Mining will give out 1370 HAZE per day as rewards)\n\n4. Yes, mint 5 million extra HAZE (this means Volume Mining will give out 3425 HAZE per day as rewards)\n\n5. Yes, mint 9 million extra HAZE (this means Volume Mining will give out 6164 HAZE per day as rewards) \n\nThank you all.
