Add alternative forms of collateral for AVAI", "body": "This proposal will allow the team to explore alternative forms of collateral beyond normal assets (e.g. ETH, BTC, etc). This can include AAVE, BenQi, and Joe tokens that autocompound, and allow the user to have their collateral increase in value while taking out loans against them with AVAI.\n\n## Motivations\nThis will open up AVAI to a large crowd that has their tokens locked away in interest bearing applications while increasing TVL and protocol revenue.\n\n## Quorum \nThe option with the most votes at the end will be implemented.\n\n## Options\n1. Yes to alternative collateral\n2. No to alternative collateral", "choices": ["Yes to alternative collateral", "No to alternative collateral"], "start": 1634756400, "end": 1635015600, "snapshot": "5857000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9F8A5B35f5508071cf2304A670EAB0803F3737aa", "space": {"id": "orcapod.eth", "name": "Orca DAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
