The remaining supply of NAR to be burned forever - effectively reducing the max capped supply. The $NAR token will become a priority token for on swap use. The $GOLD token will have a more expanded use for internal and external project purposes.\n\n\nWith the current situation of NAR, we believe that we must make impactful decisions if we want to steer this ship out of the rough seas. Bringing in a strong coded project is not enough, we need to improve and reboot tokenomics as well. \n\nWe have just published new details for the Liquidity Mining V2 phase. But we also want to grow together with the community and really allow NAR to be a project driven by the community. Hence today, we would like the NAR community to be a part of this decision.\n\n\n \u2043 In the current Narwhalswap Protocol, an 80% of NAR tokens supply has been allocated for liquidity mining (16.8 Million NAR).\n \u2043 Since the NAR farms went live 2 months ago, about 12 million NAR have been used (farmed/allocated) into the mining of these pools.\n\n\n**Moving forward, these the steps we would like to take.\nFor the use of the remaining NAR allocations:**\n \u2043 2,100,000 NAR allocated to NAR/BNB V2 pool\n \u2043 1,050,000 NAR allocated to NAR/BTC V2 pool\n \u2043 The remainder of NAR tokens initially allocated for more mining - will be burned (approx. 2,000,000)\n\n\n**What does this mean?**\n\nWe will work on the current strengths of the swap and prioritise simple and straightforward staking in the NAR/BNB and NAR/BTC pools which has worked the best and exclude stable pools. \n\nThe NAR burning mechanism will effectively do what it was made to do - to ensure that the new max cap supply of 14 million NAR continually decrease (making NAR\u2019s availability more and more rare) as well as continually fuelling the dividend pools to generate NAR for NAR-staking.\n\n\n**But what\u2019s next?**\n$GOLD. Our unsuspecting $GOLD token has taken off and become a new treasure of sailors. Our future plans will be to strengthen and diversify more and more utility for the $GOLD token as well as maintain its amazing low emissions as well as burning mechanisms. $GOLD will expand its use as collaborative and global uses as well as a valuable token to be exchanged with partners and collaborative projects. Truly making it worth the weight of its name.\n\n$NAR will be continually used as well for special features as well as continued dividends and trading for everything swap-based. Our plans will be to prioritise the $NAR token for where its strength is as well. Staking, $GEM pools, NFTs, and even new upcoming gacha features - we want to continue rewarding NAR holders in a way that is special and specific to Narwhalswap\u2019s platform.\n\n**We believe that these steps**\n \u2043 tightening NAR\u2019s supply\n \u2043 Diversifying and amplifying not just NAR but GOLD as well\n \u2043 Upgrading the protocol as a whole\n \u2043 Continually introducing new features\n\nWe\u2019ll be able to make a better impact to changing things for the better. We leave it to you, the community, to make a choice for this as well.
