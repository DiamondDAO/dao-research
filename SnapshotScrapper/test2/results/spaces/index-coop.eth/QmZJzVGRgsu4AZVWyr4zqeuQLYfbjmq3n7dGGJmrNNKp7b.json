Wintermute Trading will have to return in 1 year:\n\n* The the full loan amount in INDEX; or\n* $5 million (USDC/DAI/ETH or mutually agreed upon currency) if any Index product or INDEX itself is listed on a Tier 1 CeFi exchange (defined below) with the aid of Wintermute\u2019s efforts; or\n* $7.5 million (USDC/DAI/ETH or mutually agreed upon currency)\n\nIn return, Wintermute will commit to maintain inventory in Indices upon them being listed on any Tier 1 CeFi exchange. The amount invested will be 10% of AuM up to a total of $20 Million. In addition, Wintermute will and continue market-making on KuCoin and across DeFi aggregators.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIndex Coop will experience exponential growth through Tier 1 CEX listings and a relationship with a market-maker of Wintermute\u2019s caliber will ensure the Coop\u2019s success in listing and supporting the token. See below for more from Wintermute on their motivation and background from prior discussion posts below:\n\n> Wintermute basic background\n> \n> Wintermute was founded in July 2017 by three Optiver veterans. Evgeny Gaevoy, founder and CEO, was previously head of ETFs (screen and OTC) at Optiver Europe, one of the largest ETF market making desks.\n> \n> Wintermute\u2019s trading volume in 2H 2020 surpassed $70B and their average daily trading volumes in 2021 are over $2B\n> \n> Wintermute is backed by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Pantera, [Blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com/) Ventures and others.\n> \n> Wintermute Trading is registered with FCA for our OTC business.\n> \n> Wintermute Index Coop specific background\n> \n> Wintermute believes index products will be one of the key themes in 2021 and as a result is looking to back several teams in the space with an ultimate goal of:\n> \n> Listing the index products on key cefi exchanges and facilitating liquid markets on these products and their derivatives (starting with perpetuals, following with options)\n> \n> Combined total AuM of index products exceeding $25B by end of 2021\n> \n> Wintermute believes the key issue with these products not being adopted outside of defi is lack of market making support as market makers and exchanges are not looking to support/list them because of low AuM, while the AuM stays low because there is not enough adoption/interest outside of defi. Wintermute wants to lead that adoption by committing a significant part of it\u2019s resources and at the same time getting exposure to leading teams by becoming the official MM in protocol tokens and direct investment. Wintermute expects to be active in governance matters.\n> \n> Wintermute is already a supporter of the Coop:\n> \n> Makes markets for DPI on KuCoin and across DeFi aggregators\n> \n> Go-to provider for OTC institutional flow in coordination with IC Institutional Business team\n> \n> Invested directly in the Coop in the recent OTC sale\n> \n> Specifically for Indexcoop community Wintermute commits to:\n> \n> Provide liquid markets across all tier 1 cefi exchanges* (and a handful of 2nd tier as well). We already make markets across aggregators on defi (1inch, paraswap, matcha etc) and on KuCoin\n> \n> Proactively support listing of $INDEX on key western exchanges in coordination with BD Index Coop members\n> \n> Support new Index Coop product launches towards cefi and defi listings\n> \n> In particular, once Indices are launched on tier 1 exchange*, Wintermute commits to hold 10% of the AuM for market making purposes with a minimum of $0.5 mln per INDEX, up to $20 mln in total for all listed Indices\n> \n> Wintermute also commits to be the go-to Market Maker for any OTC institutional flow, providing competitive prices for tickets starting from 100K USD and beyond\n> \n> *Tier 1 comprising of: Binance, Huobi, OKEX, Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini\n> \n> Should it be determined that Wintermute is not expending efforts towards the above commitments, Index Coop may recall the loan.\n> \n> Ask :\n> \n> We would like to request the Index Coop community to pass a proposal to approve the transfer of up to 1% of the total token supply of $INDEX for Market Making services of $INDEX on key centralized exchanges.\n> \n> We propose to Index Coop Community appointing a third party agent (Wintermute Trading) to act as the Index Coop Community Agent to market-make $INDEX across cefi, defi and OTC\n> \n> To facilitate the work of the Community Agent on the community\u2019s behalf, we propose to authorize operational actions required to effectuate the market making, including release of up to 100K $INDEX to the Community Agent from the Indexcoop Token Supply for liquidity provisioning.\n> \n> This proposal has been discussed in the forums and on a community call and will move to IIP absent significant feedback.\n\n## Specification\nSend 100,000 INDEX to a designated Wintermute address to secure the terms above and held/returned per this proposal.\n\n### Rationale\nThis proposal incentivizes one of the largest market-makers in our industry to work on behalf of our protocol. All other market-making proposals the BD and IB teams have reviewed have requested a significant inventory loan of DPI/MVI or whatever products we're market-making PLUS either a fee structure or option incentive. Wintermute will not require product inventory loans and has committed to using its balance sheet on behalf of the Coop. This step will have an exponential impact on the Coop and we look forward to working with Wintermute to make our products widely available off-chain.\u200c\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related
