This grant is expected to  sustain Index Coop contributor rewards until the end of Q1 2021.\n\nThe Treasury Committee's Index token distribution for October is listed [here](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/october-rewards-distribution-methodology/262).\nThe Treasury Committee's wallet transactions is available for audit [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe2250424378b6a6dC912f5714cfd308a8D593986).\n\nIn IIP-4 the Index Coop Treasury Committee was entrusted with distributing 10,000 in INDEX rewards for contributions to the Index Coop.\nThe Index Coop Treasury Committee contends it has distributed those rewards according to principles of Fairness, Sensibility & Flexibility [set forth in the original IIP](./iip-004.md).\n\nThis proposal adheres to the same aims and goals outlined in IIP-4. A vote for this proposal is essentially a vote to continue down the path outlined in IIP-4.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPrior to the October reward distribution, INDEX token price dropped to less than \\$2 per INDEX. INDEX distribution was slightly increased to accurately value Coop contributions. Roughly 7,500 out of the 10,000 INDEX granted to the Treasury Committee was spent in the October distribution.\n\nNovember has seen a steady increase in new users joining the Coop, and current users ramping up their existing contribution efforts.\n\nTo continue rewarding contributors for work towards the Index Coop an additional grant of funds is required.\n\n#### FOR\n\n- Grant the Index Coop Treasury Committee 50,000 INDEX to continue reward ditsribution to Index Coop contributors.\n\n#### AGAINST\n\n- Do not grant the Index Coop Treasury Committee additional funds to continue reward distributions to Index Coop contributors.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST"], "start": 1607108400, "end": 1607367600, "snapshot": "11387691", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB0Ff82C91178f66aA40224Abd425E2AC7AE28ceA", "space": {"id": "index-coop.eth", "name": "Index"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
