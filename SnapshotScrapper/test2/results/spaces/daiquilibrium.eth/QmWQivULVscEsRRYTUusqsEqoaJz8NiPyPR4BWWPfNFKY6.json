Everything is paused, but the coupon timer is still ticking. Shouldn't coupons be frozen to reflect the rest of the protocol? I'm proposing that coupons receive an extension. \n\nThe proposal:\nThe coupon extension should be fair based on the added time that the migration has taken\u20142.5 weeks at the time of writing. The proposed extension is 611 epochs to coupons bought before epoch 819 (6 days after proposal 10 when the epochs stopped advancing). The number 611 epochs is derived from calculating the # of epochs to extend the coupons. An average of the TWAP (TWAP*epoch time) for the last 2.5 weeks was divided into the number of seconds since then.\n\n\nThe resulting proposed extension is 611 epochs.", "choices": ["Extend coupons by 611 epochs.", "Extend coupons but <611 epochs.", "No extensions should be given."], "start": 1615017600, "end": 1615190340, "snapshot": "11980976", "state": "closed", "author": "0x83b845D7D355Ee4c020f825e10d2DF9Ad8550b38", "space": {"id": "daiquilibrium.eth", "name": "Daiquilibrium"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmT4JGZGkYeiXdL7rpeaGhdnjAuTrwcQp9hP47aoasy1q8", "voter": "0x0794e8235FBDfAf2061a6721AdE61126d8493B35", "created": 1615127398, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "daiquilibrium.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma4KGY6AQQPXkG1QCiekfsbSaJpPgE9RvBK1QNgKUZX6P", "voter": "0x46a8536703975fA7729616cf0f901e49c930c23B", "created": 1615072522, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "daiquilibrium.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmai5SvUaJxjE25dMhdTD7wNtmeeqhdGBE838brVzyvTUo", "voter": "0x061716a85ABA5e37626e4A2c33596d59823d30b8", "created": 1615037748, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "daiquilibrium.eth"}}]}
