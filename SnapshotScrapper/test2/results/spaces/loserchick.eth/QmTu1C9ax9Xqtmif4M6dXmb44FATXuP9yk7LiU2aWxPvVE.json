Mostly, it is caused by a soft  fork of the Polygon network, for further details, you can refer to the medium piece: \n \n To sum up, currently Polygon transactions need to wait 128 blocks before the main chain can be confirmed, during which time a soft fork may also exist.\n \nAnd if we wait 128 blocks to confirm, it takes about 6 minutes. We all know the anxiety of waiting for the minting result. But we also know the frustration of having a rare chick NFT  become an ordinary one.\n \nSo now we want to launch a vote and please choose the one you mostly agree with. \n \nReference:  https://medium.com/loserchick/voting-time-can-chicks-transform-15480ab4cb4f\n \nProposal\n1.  Wait for 128 block confirmation which is around  6 minutes to show the result of your minted NFTs.  \nIn this case, we can eliminate the transforming chick NFTs problem.\n \n2.  Wait for 1 block confirmation plus 25 seconds more, which is around 9 blocks in total to show the temporary result. \nIn this case, there will be a few occasions, we might get the wrong NFTs show in the EGG Bar due to a soft fork of the network and need to wait  for 6 minutes or so to check it in the LoserClub or Polygon explorer.\n \n \nVoting Rules\n1. The amount of TrumpChick that you own(both in your wallet and in the mining contract) rules the voting power that you have. Each TrumpChick represents one voting power.\n2.Voting will last 2 days.This is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n \nThe two options to vote on are:\n1. Wait for 128 block confirmation\n2. Wait for 1 block confirmation plus 25 seconds\n \nThis is a binary vote. The option that receives more than 50% of the vote will be viewed as the community consensus and executed.\n", "choices": ["Wait for 128 block confirmation", "Wait for 1 block confirmation pl"], "start": 1628856000, "end": 1629028800, "snapshot": "17935000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7D619532b6d17cab5c6fB0a61C8D21f46727b7a0", "space": {"id": "loserchick.eth", "name": "LoserChick"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
