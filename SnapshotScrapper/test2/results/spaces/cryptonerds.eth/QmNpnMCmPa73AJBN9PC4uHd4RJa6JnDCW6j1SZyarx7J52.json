The council has received your suggestions and has reached a consensus. Do you have your $CND lock and loaded? If not, acquire them here:\n\nhttps://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x022dbE7FE889FE5353DB6d5c63D7dC2c13D38f29\n\nPlease vote below on the altcoins we should look into next week. \n\nBut BEWARE! The more altcoins you pick, the less likely we are of selecting the one you genuinely want us to analyze. Think of your bags, sir!\n\nHOW QUADRATIC VOTING WORKS\n\nYou may choose as many options as you'd like. Each vote on each option increases the cost of voting quadratically (power of 2). Therefore, the more times you vote in one option, the more costly it is.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n- Minimum of 0.000000001 $CND\n- You've bought $CND prior to the proposal creation date\n\nVOTING DATES:\n\n- Start: 25/06/21 20:00 UTC\n- End: 27/06/21 23:00 UTC", "choices": ["Ethereum", "Hex", "Uniswap", "Thorchain", "Binance Coin", "Monero"], "start": 1624647600, "end": 1624831200, "snapshot": "8610483", "state": "closed", "author": "0x05D3870513eF032d245441FAD75a2d19bBb917f7", "space": {"id": "cryptonerds.eth", "name": "CryptoNerds DAO"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmREoKEb9biioJZniA43aubF3SeWP9d2etPTT1UrNn3gE7", "voter": "0x617725A9E06E19e7C95E980252F83443381fee5b", "created": 1624660048, "choice": {"5": 1}, "space": {"id": "cryptonerds.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSGNNDjEN5XE8vd9nwd58xcDLu4qH4UjHkhyh4pyanWAp", "voter": "0x7c9a70711247b449057806a3a6938A904fFE2585", "created": 1624647982, "choice": {"5": 1}, "space": {"id": "cryptonerds.eth"}}]}
