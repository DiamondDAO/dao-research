By opening the rebalancing decision to the DAO we are keeping in line with the core value proposition of the SCIFI index and following its methodology.\n\nHow?\u2028\nMission Control will suggest two tokens to be removed and 8 potential additions to the index. The 10 assets will include the two tokens that Mission Control suggests removing, so that the DAO may choose to keep them in after all. The two assets with the most votes will be included. The rebalancing will be implemented on the 19th of the month.\n", "choices": [" $PERP - Perpetual Protocol", " $ENJIN - Enjin", " $MLN - Enzyme Finance", " $CRV - Curve Finance", " $BAL - Balancer", " $NXM - Nexus Mutual", " $HOLO - Holochain", " $BOR - BoringDAO", " $GRT - The Graph", " $YF-DAI - YFDAI Finance"], "start": 1621171800, "end": 1621344600, "snapshot": "12445729", "state": "closed", "author": "0x954689C01A01d3F776eB69B753C084e526812f8d", "space": {"id": "spicedao.eth", "name": "SPICE"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPPAJbvR81mjX3yYNKtpAinktMthdQRLF6AmhHdMTrr3a", "voter": "0x92EEaE926eBBe3941d2da9e9383e24Eb20Bc295C", "created": 1621281243, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "spicedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaQkyh4hY4vk3xTnNYJdMDrkSSiFVAXjwGzHFKQoZjLd4", "voter": "0xcd8ed310678470682D72C50635a79eF9346ba4C4", "created": 1621246198, "choice": 10, "space": {"id": "spicedao.eth"}}]}
