On top of that, we might face potential security risk that can happen because of the bridge exploits that happened recently (on anyswap). To add on, the 1:1 bridge would mean that if ever 1 token on any chain get exploited, the rest will get exploited as well since price are pegged as compared to each having its own price in each ecosystem.\n\nFor the 3rd option (No, but earning split equally) meant that, whilst we don't have the 1:1 bridge, all the earnings on BSC and Polygon will be consolidated end of every weekly and distributed equally (7.25:6) ratio. Eg, if we made $132,500 this week, $72,500 goes to PIRATE holders and $60,000 goes to PIRATEP holders because thats the current supply allocation.\n\n(Staked PIRATE or Staked LP or LP holdings in wallet will not be counted so you need to unstake and hold PIRATE in your wallet right before block 9881500)\n\nCountdown to snapshot: https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/9881500\n\nVoting will open and start on 9th August 2pm UTC and ends 11th August 2pm UTC.\n\n*If voted \"No\", 1:1 bridge won't happen but in return, to help support price of PIRATEP, all profits from Polygon game and chest will stay within Polygon and not flow to BSC for PIRATE holders.", "choices": ["Yes to 1:1 Bridge", "No to 1:1 Bridge", "No, but earnings split equally"], "start": 1628517600, "end": 1628690400, "snapshot": "9881550", "state": "closed", "author": "0x177d82553bdbaD8AfFE6481848800F1F2C234d9D", "space": {"id": "treasurekey.eth", "name": "TreasureKey"}, "votes": 13, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSUtcDPmGkos293woiLSi6E8rt5ETh9kSc2hY9CeYEvsi", "voter": "0x3C8AeDB118926955C65E475C8b78b03319423a71", "created": 1628533700, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "treasurekey.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc4SwobhxLa262h4n61zmhym8S1FQW487EKhvw527gNeW", "voter": "0x7a79b2692D8DfaC3bA728F4116522cd34D699065", "created": 1628528032, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "treasurekey.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ7SsqrvQjDamPJajnyGAobjjoPTQGaPM3kzRu8Xe4YpD", "voter": "0xC39847F1Ba8BC590cA4c63DaBc02779a475baecA", "created": 1628525975, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "treasurekey.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeXi8CNSxKf2uxAf3uEvJRri8BDmrAuQQSr7mZE1hd4hs", "voter": "0x52e5ac7DbBDE48E4498ef29a184801b3Ef2e4b04", "created": 1628523415, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "treasurekey.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcnvMf2f3JoP9QBjzUs9zjKkjwGy1CuRc8L7CHhyqpPkW", "voter": "0x5bE15977bDbA2A7f4F98c12c1310F47dc275ea1E", "created": 1628521845, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "treasurekey.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNdQvq5ajmPY2t5aoehMFxL4zRjnwzzwjNdd1AYiJzWoX", "voter": "0x1a15F337713097895e175588e16A78dd07e6fb43", "created": 1628521758, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "treasurekey.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRCNeASgvpPqGUoDTCBE6BVQcq2fiiA7ZzmPXyYHYwYbz", "voter": "0x7365625047aB2A549D82A96c4D8168993b443D7e", "created": 1628521729, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "treasurekey.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXrMhF64rMQmi7zG97AoB51eavW6RYyTwqHZpvQQxvTKB", "voter": "0xa891EeeE5A35978aE6B79C2a22670B485645aDEF", "created": 1628521158, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "treasurekey.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU8EzskSachqpGQSBvnFfgmyUgeDnJ1X5ZmBcydArQoik", "voter": "0xe2B7060237E4d0328a2D0DAF1CC1E8d52854aEbF", "created": 1628521027, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "treasurekey.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeGYXUKnSX8sKWcb3RzQMnuP1FM1nQKgeFTveKn3KQBng", "voter": "0xc5F31ecD454695ec06d466AFEeB2afd4985F1da3", "created": 1628519848, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "treasurekey.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdaN5fLFnCjefX6Jba3EV9vsZF3yuaeGXzSFe1fCM3rbE", "voter": "0x489CAF6518c28804E31CaE58a1429341D739b73f", "created": 1628519510, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "treasurekey.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbaVDR7aSvPJ8SEdHH2q6QaqM8NdY3tu5JfbS4B4fVhcx", "voter": "0x125771EdDf015Ab0535BFcDA8E8982925a9e38DF", "created": 1628519368, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "treasurekey.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYAbBGMTafgf4agzrURoHEaLXxt8kNBwC6KcRWBpog1K6", "voter": "0xf3A0453EDb35FC50C2Bd615058904A169a4133fD", "created": 1628518086, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "treasurekey.eth"}}]}
