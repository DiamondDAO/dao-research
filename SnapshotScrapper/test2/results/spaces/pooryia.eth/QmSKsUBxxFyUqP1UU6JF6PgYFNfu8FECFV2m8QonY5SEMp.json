Votes are initially counted for each voter's top choice. If a candidate has more than half of the vote based on first-choices, that choice wins. If not, then the choice with the fewest votes is eliminated. The voters who selected the defeated choice as a first choice then have their votes added to the totals of their next choice. This process continues until a choice has more than half of the votes. When the field is reduced to two, it has become an \"instant runoff\" that allows a comparison of the top two choice head-to-head.\n\n\nExample:\nRank the episodes from most to least favorite.", "choices": ["E1", "E2", "E3", "E4"], "start": 1629876600, "end": 1630654200, "snapshot": "13106246", "state": "closed", "author": "0x53Df7C1a39248589013c3bDa3D0d1cC9fAB1651C", "space": {"id": "pooryia.eth", "name": "StonerCats/BigHead Test"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYnPahU1fkfQqNyvyFf3a12ocvSZ7SqqkApfkG75EoC2Y", "voter": "0xA912A779Ac36F018ebde0032d13e0d065BE28751", "created": 1630181187, "choice": [2, 1, 4, 3], "space": {"id": "pooryia.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWxCkHT3K8PusGxJr3uoqqH8AtKTLdPRCsHEYyCaRNFiR", "voter": "0x6C37148710E10d07522b4754d336E49daB5B1167", "created": 1630180607, "choice": [1, 2, 3, 4], "space": {"id": "pooryia.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUATFNfwcKPMKV1oNbGoBLcb8mB3suwRHTGTptBttiLe4", "voter": "0x53Df7C1a39248589013c3bDa3D0d1cC9fAB1651C", "created": 1630055350, "choice": [1, 4, 2, 3], "space": {"id": "pooryia.eth"}}]}
