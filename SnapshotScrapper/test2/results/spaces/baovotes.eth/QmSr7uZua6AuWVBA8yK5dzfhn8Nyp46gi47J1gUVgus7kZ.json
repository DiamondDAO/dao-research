Some of our pools have < $100 in them or less than 0.01% of the LP tokens. These pools are being used by people to dump Bao on the community and hurt the price.\n2. Some of our largest pools have lower weight than they should.\n\nI think we should manually adjust the rewards, removing some pools that there is little interest in, and increasing the rewards for other pools that have performed well (including the Bao pool)\n\nHere is my proposal:\n\nIncrease Bao to 50,000 weight from 32,000 weight.\nIncrease UTK to 1000 weight from 750 weight.\nIncrease Sushi to 5000 weight from 4000 weight\nIncrease DPI to 6000 weight from 4000 weight.\nIncrease PRE to 1000 from 250\nIncrease Lien to 2500 from 2000\nIncrease Nexo to 1000 from 750\nIncrease CRE to 1000 from 250\nIncrease RGT to 1500 from 1000\nIncrease FRONT to 1500 from 1000\nIncrease Cover to 1000 from 500\n\nLower GNO to 0\nLower DMG to 0\nLower Donut to 0\nLower DF to 0\nLower XIO to 0\nLower TTT to 0\nLower QSP to 0\nLower JUL to 0\nLower Rep (v1) to 0\nLower MANA to 0\nLower SLP to 0\nLower mUSD to 0\nLower LRC to 0\nLower Owl to 0\nLower L2 to 0\nLower Pickle to 0\nLower BAL to 2000 from 4000\n\n# Pros:\n* This will drastically improve rewards for most high usage pools.\n* This will increase rewards for the main Bao pool.\n* It will open up spots for some new pools.\n\n# Cons:\n* It may lower our chance to attract users from these communities in the future, but we can always recreate rewards later on.", "choices": ["Approve", "Disapprove "], "start": 1608051600, "end": 1608397200, "snapshot": "11461748", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3bC3c8aF8CFe3dFC9bA1A57c7C3b653e3f6d6951", "space": {"id": "baovotes.eth", "name": "baovotes.eth"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmd9GwvAxrt1UjBCxToSCpPTkn8mnDs1xBLhhb7vJeH5wb", "voter": "0x68FE69bfc4D7197232BCA722F08baaE3d51Dd4D3", "created": 1608323787, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "baovotes.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYdKwPbCXp6hzV4nJprvZWAqcYSycPT4Y33L2zx2Mb44r", "voter": "0xCC1e0A566dbd10869c071c811aBa436357858f05", "created": 1608321514, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "baovotes.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNwrwHT4kSB986BbY9esR6kBpJSRFgRFLnAVGwmmjQuyo", "voter": "0xBD9E322303Fa0EE764d8Efb497Ca4b81589A281a", "created": 1608316886, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "baovotes.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYUzBY4rEd5fZvdbdtjiJCbTVQHWxbRh1vgVACsAD4zSv", "voter": "0x1b43BCaf30a19D3C619E8AFf02Fe134f66AAdc8B", "created": 1608258081, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "baovotes.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme4djZ3JargDBkc5cUCDnPacQ7uEaQ35PDDN4bBWzojWq", "voter": "0x24BDB92387F09e32C3099Ce4383b2ec893247083", "created": 1608183768, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "baovotes.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTcLTv2AVe3HBoxfYfsGmjZ2FsypB24GCeS9DCx98kPeL", "voter": "0xc86Df18DD09E0c756a4729aF8deD63bEC651A6c9", "created": 1608155817, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "baovotes.eth"}}]}
