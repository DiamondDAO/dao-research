{"id": "QmXnZwjHzQK4Ngs2u1wArAMMggJkVEW2jfydULQeKTbDLY", "title": "YIP002 - to reduce ongoing pool inflation", "body": "Yuan built in a reward of base 400,000 Yuan for the 1st year for on-going pools, with 70% going to Yuan/USDx pool and 30% going to Yuan/ETH. Given the expected positive rebase, the actual reward (base reward times the scaling factor) will be quite high, which are unnecessary.   \n\nHence, I propose to reduce the base Yuan rewards for the 1st year from 400,000 Yuan to 120,000 Yuan, while maintaining the same 70/30 splits between the two pools. \n\nRationales: \nLet\u2019s make a reasonable assumption that total Yuan outstanding could scale up 10x from the current base (around $3.4m market cap) over the next 6 months, the reward will be 4,000,000 Yuan per year, if we assume a reasonable 10% APY for Yuan liquidity, the total incentivized liquidity will be around 40,000,000 or $6m. This amount of liquidity is absolutely excessive. \n\nFor a pool with $500,000 liquidity, it will be able to support $5,000 trade with less than 2% price impact, which could serve the purpose for a good liquidity for average user day-to-day transaction. If we need to incentivize a $1m pools (each pool with half million liquidity) for 10% APY, the total reward for the given year, should be around $100,000, or equivalent of 650,000 Yuan (for 1 Yuan = 1 CNY), if we put the scaling factor at 5, that equals to un-based amount of approximately 120,000 Yuan v.s 400,000 Yuan now. \n\nSo, I propose to reduce the base rewards from 400,000 Yuan to 120,000 Yuan to tamper down unnecessary inflation, but maintain the existing split between USDx/Yuan and USDx/ETH pools.
