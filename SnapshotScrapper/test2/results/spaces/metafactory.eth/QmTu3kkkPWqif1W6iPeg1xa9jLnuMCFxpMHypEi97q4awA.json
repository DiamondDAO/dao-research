If so, what % of ops distribution?", "body": "Forum Thread with all the details: https://gov.metafactory.ai/t/proposal-9-adopting-sourcecred/181\n\n## The MF Covenant\n\nThe following is a list of guidelines that I'm proposing we adopt when thinking about how we coordinate and govern ourselves now and in the future.\n\n1. We should measure the value of contributions, not contributors.\n2. Contributors should be rewarded proportional to the impact they have, not how many hours they work.\n3. We should minimize how much time and effort we spend on governance and decision making since they just a means to an end, our mission is to create / build dope stuff and realize our collective vision of a web3 cultural economy / metaverse, not play governance games.\n4. We shouldn't incentivize behaviour that is self-optimizing at the expense of our larger goal / community.\n5. Our rewards should be outcome based. Distribute tokens for actual work done, not the promise of future work.\n6. We move forward at rough consensus (all objections within reason are fully addressed, not necessarily solved. Coherence around long term vision is reestablished, so that we can improve, iteratively, without stalling). This is the framework: https://andytudhope.africa/essays/running-code\n7. We establish a building / collective dreaming multiplier: i.e. we spend 10-20x time on building & collective dreaming to 1x governance.\n\nIf we don't rely on an agreed-upon process / framework, we will be very inaccurate / inefficient / biased / game-able when it comes to token allocation and delivering it in the most sound / incentive aligned way.\n\n## Process / Structure / Rules\n\n1. Active contributors are allowed to add new contributions in the [contribution dashboard](https://metafactory.retool.com/embedded/public/3cdd1037-d8f5-4b16-b42f-064f9f78be4e)\n2. Active contributors, Headbots and Alphabots are allowed to rate contributions (could apply weighting multiplier based on role)\n3. Any contributions that have been \"flagged\" will not make it into SourceCred until any concerns raised have been addressed.\n4. The weight of each contribution will be set in proportion to the ratings given. Higher rating = higher weight. \n\nWeight of a single vote: \n\n| Rating  |  Weight |\n|---|---|\n| legendary | 18  |\n| epic  | 9 |\n| rare |  3 |\n| common |  1 |\n\n`Weight of a contribution = (MEAN(voteWeights) + SUM(voteWeights) / 10) * 2`\n\n\n5. Any exploitative behaviour will not be accepted (e.g. collusion / quid-pro-quo, rating only your own contributions high, sybil attacks). This can only be enforced at a cultural / social level. We should all be aligned that the process works best when everyone is playing honestly.\n6. Every 6-8 weeks the contributions will be added to SourceCred and we will distribute ROBOT proportional to the $ sales milestones.\n7. Any issues with the distribution should be dealt with at the contribution / rating level. The resulting numbers from SourceCred should not get changed through any other means besides changing the input to SourceCred.", "choices": ["Yes, 75% of ops distro", "Yes, 50% of ops distro", "Yes, 25% of ops distro", "No, 0% of ops distro"], "start": 1626285600, "end": 1626544800, "snapshot": "12827258", "state": "closed", "author": "0x8F942ECED007bD3976927B7958B50Df126FEeCb5", "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth", "name": "MetaFactory"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSukZMGFuomouSiPEieV2gBxjWHcD1ZmbiQxpuDAUfyKn", "voter": "0xC6C9D802bC16d8746AAfCAc4781F9a8d442D585D", "created": 1626529235, "choice": [3], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXWgSC8ddd9rjG8uGVicXKNJyJ3BFFEB8x7ChniQ22Msb", "voter": "0xfaCEf700458D4Fc9746F7f3e0d37B462711fF09e", "created": 1626414208, "choice": [2], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaY8AJrtW7PPnZHYVsLnL596Pn1DA5PdyhwShqwSYQ7pr", "voter": "0x930A7CD60A633128B7c5181307781e6d033BA51a", "created": 1626392801, "choice": [2], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "Qma3NXRUUJUjQYN5rYKnZyNbYTeNawj7T9QzboJ3AuivXm", "voter": "0x9bcDc7db2f57B0f960A737ccC29373a9bc760134", "created": 1626390480, "choice": [2], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRw7Xeb9g7BTimHRCdxCu5AW1dfqqARrddveEi2mqF8FA", "voter": "0xE75304fE5bb590B6deA3CA13A8aBAb257c12E753", "created": 1626383240, "choice": [2], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTu5tP4wcHxUpPkSs45rEKS6aoJ1vKJFdEpv48TGcDS4K", "voter": "0xc4a69B137d22b52A36328F3ac6d5Aa9984fAab8E", "created": 1626377547, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW8K4ehK5ZF63kU3F5ZAy2ruRX4FxwDPoASb9ygnPn8X6", "voter": "0x79926e8bCCE923473ec81c047e71b749459C22F7", "created": 1626368157, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXZjMGNy2jgizSrCiSBnaMDRWFcwhm4ZNGZ1YRNfr17ve", "voter": "0xeab5ecC6A488fC6896c5a9b45C5b6A1CdB3aFf70", "created": 1626335729, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNuQpY2WhGXtouMa95XQT5prHJGKrVtB9NsbkcxQt2WKs", "voter": "0x48f88A8D8e4a9dFF33C0A4D857a81A189C2d6e07", "created": 1626318615, "choice": [2], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXg38RjMCpHsG5CZXwLGQKcpKAvdtwQ39u9ynfZqcwD5w", "voter": "0x231557D79f2320a46cC61D97070a7d64664ED2df", "created": 1626317826, "choice": [4, 3, 2, 1], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRnT5co7XzmhS7x7VjNd5r7BAEvEiN2YrX6upTueJY4NC", "voter": "0xE38d978e500242E5E6DF46BE5dc1Bd47cb06555f", "created": 1626301416, "choice": [3], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb2tHW6AeQUMzqPtJHXjF9Wn5nWgmG66aAdf9ofyvkui3", "voter": "0x52d81d4a8b18D6BA0b2c01dd2f9927eAf755dd0a", "created": 1626299649, "choice": [2, 3, 4, 1], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc9yzXXN4kfUALMDyAajMZFQkBAPg16xrqpWSWihyzj1i", "voter": "0x8F942ECED007bD3976927B7958B50Df126FEeCb5", "created": 1626297466, "choice": [1, 2], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmct6K8QVyLSJKcCbos38tqZXdpb5bgmWSw6wKi68ae2Nf", "voter": "0x8B257B97C0e07E527B073b6513ba8Ea659279b61", "created": 1626296460, "choice": [2], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmexm7cz2RmtybGPjj1VycwRCYehijHNuQJsZPGwFFm9Hc", "voter": "0x54c375c481f95ba43e2cEcd6Ef30631f55518f57", "created": 1626296254, "choice": [2, 1, 3, 4], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT1VPr7UMMtoDC7YqnpjiXbbJEesURUvTES91cyG4KLAv", "voter": "0x4cCa9821c246acd39a42F34e6ae4E520A8224565", "created": 1626295535, "choice": [2], "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}]}
