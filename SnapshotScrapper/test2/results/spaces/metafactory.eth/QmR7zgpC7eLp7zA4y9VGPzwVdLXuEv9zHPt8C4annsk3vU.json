This covers social media management, newsletter design and creation, website maintenance and general design work. There may be additional expenses related to specific campaigns (new Reels, etc.), but any budget overruns resulting from extra work will be voted on separately. \n\nIn full disclosure, when Hammad and I initially proposed a partnership with FLOC*, we offered them a small stake in MF in return for ongoing brand management and design support. The $ROBOT allocation that they received was compensation for this agreement, but not for services rendered. They are a creative collective with many different resources engaged and a non-trivial amount of overhead. However, due to aligned incentives and their love for MF, their ongoing rate for services is incredibly low - especially when measured against value delivered.'\n\nIf passed, we will continue to pay FLOC* \u20ac1,500/month in exchange for general brand management and design support. \n ", "choices": ["Yay", "Nay"], "start": 1606868400, "end": 1607027400, "snapshot": "11369790", "state": "closed", "author": "0xf8049C8425f9eAb4E2AE9E1D950f9D3F71481882", "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth", "name": "MetaFactory"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUAiSDyp94hLs4LAsb87mTtCC3YqWSLRuH6UFjnAh2r5t", "voter": "0xfaCEf700458D4Fc9746F7f3e0d37B462711fF09e", "created": 1607012927, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcxpJ3dYVHaFTV3fnK7ih4U1othM33LEhQUGwDcoBc1Ju", "voter": "0x0EaBFFD8cE94ab2387fC44Ba32642aF0c58Af433", "created": 1606976139, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd489GuWbuzCrk4j5B6ULVWgmEjgoRVF8DXomwtKiQc94", "voter": "0x79926e8bCCE923473ec81c047e71b749459C22F7", "created": 1606954423, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmcq2Jv2cLxRsvc8NEqSWggzD4sKMrJCcn6wDekX4khVkb", "voter": "0x1C5EB68630cCd90C3152FB9Dee3a1C2A7201631D", "created": 1606937933, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc9acgS9bT3Dw5DeNBkX9ZgscUZ1XddviSFVCBaKJozng", "voter": "0x30dB01087fEBd7b67DC486812b322b4867Cb8cA7", "created": 1606879445, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWKy6hZYj91DNC5jKjR5yuaeazDjBTu5Pgc5jugKD71mq", "voter": "0x442DCCEe68425828C106A3662014B4F131e3BD9b", "created": 1606871399, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "metafactory.eth"}}]}
