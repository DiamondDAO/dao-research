To give us time to audit the SourceCred initiatives and to split out my grant request, the core team proposed to nullify the previous ops distribution vote. \n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/metafactory.eth/proposal/QmW1M6XJo63RnzKoowrQqPWcipJipy12wtuuaDFNvBBiz4 \n\nI would like to take this opportunity to formally suggest a grant process and also restate my previous grant request. I will also provide additional visibility and rational into my grant request. To establish the process I will set reason and steps to follow to define the grant process. The grant format will require several pieces of key information.\n\nA Grant request is a specific request for funds from the organization for goods or services. Typically grants will be for retainer for contributors, but may be retroactive for past considerations of things like expense reimbursement. These grants ensure core contributors are able to focus their attention on the MetaFactory project.\n\nGrantees will request a specific amount and state a clear purpose for their grant. All grant request are to be proposed to the community. If community sentiment is favorable a grant may be proposed on Snapshot for official voting. \n\n\nGrant request title: penguin 2020 Core Contributor Grant\nGrant request amount: 2000 Robot\nGrant description: penguin is requesting a 2000 Robot Grant for catch-up payments for services rendered from  November 2019 through December 2020. During this 13 month window before the current ops consideration, I was an active contributor actively earning for MetaFactory. I helped provide suggestion and edits for initial medium articles. During my services there were many tasks that I contributed such as doing initial QC of T6, I gathered the process documents and created the initial alpha run bomber jacket and was a technician for all of the initial masks. I generated preview images and established connections with early artists and supporters. I generated several one off garments for MetaFactory performing product R&D and for early partners requests (Such as Alotta-Money). I leveraged personal connections and recruited clients to MetaFactory and supported client and robot support questions. I have provided impeccable customer service and community support. I provide white glove service to clients from intake interview request, through designs, product selection. I help set up drops and support clients during and post drop. During the past year of service I lead and supported 22 clients. I have brought on and trained new designers and technicians and enhanced the MetaFactory brand through direct marketing, writing articles and making videos. During this time I was on several pod-casts, live streams and supported MetaFactory initiatives from inside other core communities which have been clients. My wife and I routinely create new graphical assets to support MetaFactory assets such as making the robot faces into svgs and client work. We created physical art such as the Wicked Sunday Club Coasters and have printed and set thousands of stickers.\n\nGrant Rational:\nI have done all these things and many more without any compensation or consideration for my time or services. I routinely asked about ops distribution and tried to resolve the issue before the current Ops distribution. I humbly ask for 2000 Robot. This amount is based on approximate previous Robots distributions awarded to contributors. I believe this to be the fair value of work that I created during the initial uncertain times of MetaFactory as I helped support us through our initial growth phase. This grant is a catch-up amount and is not consideration for future work. There are no other contributors that could make such a claim and frequent robot distributions will ensure that we will not have future unsupported contributors. \n\n\nVoter Guide:\nA Vote For penguin's grant proposal will earmark 2000 Robot from the ops distribution for contributor catch up grant request.\n\nA Vote Against penguin's grant proposal will reject the grant request\n\nA vote to Abstain will support the outcome of the vote without voting in favor or against the proposal\n\nA vote to Discuss further will cancel the grant request, but allow for amendment of the grant request.
