However; the results of the snapshot vote selected one of the proposals. The core team has asked to nullify the previous vote and requested that I removed my grant proposal. Thank you for the votes and support. In support for the community, if the previous vote is nullified I will remove my grant request from the ops distribution and make a separate proposal. Also, based on review of the SourceCred initiatives, core team will audit and adjusted initiatives before the next ops distribution vote.\n\nThe current proposal seeks to nullify the previous SNAPSHOT proposal  https://snapshot.org/#/metafactory.eth/proposal/QmczN7Chj7mAwznVrqachMcm3TKZjBk2htqtF9ZJFrcgXN\n\nVote For Nullification: Previous vote will be nullified and OPS distribution will return to the discussion phase for further refinement.  \n\nVote Against Nullification: Previous vote should be considered accurate. OPS distribution should commence, penguin will not make a separate grant proposal.\n\nVote Abstain: Do not vote for either outcome, delegate response to community decision.
