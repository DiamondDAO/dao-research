We decided this due to the urgency of the situation. Also Snapshot votes are merely to gauge community sentiment and do not result in on-chain changes.*\n\nRe-pegging ZAI is a straightforward solution to a hard problem. The community has bounced around *many*, many ideas (head on over to #governance in discord for more details). A re-peg simultaneously addresses hyperinflation head-on while also being simple enough in code that -- given the urgency of the situation -- we can push quickly.\n\n**$0.25 (Operation Quarterz)**: A 25c re-peg resets us back to pre-inflation-bug value essentially. We were at 100m supply before the expansion bug, and are now hovering around 400mm. This will leave us with a mcap of 15mm. It will also be harder to reach peg vs. lower options. This is the equivalent of having the current price of ZAI ($0.04) be $0.16 if the bug never happened.\n\n**$0.10 (Operation Bonzai)**: A 10c re-peg is more psychologically palatable (base 10) and we have likely experienced heavier capital flight than other algo-stables with no inflation bug. This will lower the mcap to around 6mm. This is the equivalent of having the current price of ZAI ($0.04) be $0.40 if the bug never happened.\n\n**No Repeg**: We wait for a better solution. The risk here is a huge amount of capital is being freed in two days and without proposing a solution to inflation, most of that capital will sell and leave the protocol for good. The upside to voting No Re-peg is potential for a better solution. We feel that we have vetted many options and have a dearth of solidity developers at our disposal, so do not feel No re-peg is a good idea. \n\n**NOTE**: We are still reviewing implications of re-peg. At present, because the code merely checks the uniswap TWAP price for expansion and debt, there shouldn't be any changes required to LP's. This is not an on-chain vote, just to gather community sentiment.", "choices": ["Repeg to $0.25", "Repeg to $0.10", "No Repeg"], "start": 1610424000, "end": 1610510400, "snapshot": "11635739", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9E64B47bBdb9c1F7B599f11987b84C416C0c4110", "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth", "name": "Zero Collateral Dai"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmctkb59sKhwaFYycS3rsS4DuzZrhCiEBV4KxVUVcFN4sM", "voter": "0x70A61Db3F8161043929a92b9782c69e161e12e8A", "created": 1610481756, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcnA2WyNgqQdxVu5KniVGYeeAHQrdUE1tXSwoPsCc3kHm", "voter": "0xcf409818C6ed9Eafa6B8E4D31069B1A762edD267", "created": 1610447180, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfLFhojuC41L6dmm69LcDEbLpuZKnYsoQHyZ2eakYcoVD", "voter": "0xD2fCfD3fa77b05D49FB46F1bF78eAE688d390e64", "created": 1610428768, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZEm3XJPhjGFmjpiNVwAKziXdEpoXeNq7GDE1Rxb2rFiM", "voter": "0x290e9603dDE0B26A65842C84Dd75845d87C63607", "created": 1610427221, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTgDWgknjCFoBSH5rWvEo6YgVLUdD6MooCRCE1Z21PXhC", "voter": "0x9FC9F9E3B7E4744F5e7a2ab904FEde2A1A914E44", "created": 1610427193, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQaccSz1U6o5pS1KxtnYkCTBCdnV6SHr7ufTMs1Cx7oMy", "voter": "0x274f83434Ae3c8c61E8d1b2BD261eCF1Ce28dcA7", "created": 1610426818, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeXyj7LNexTPxMTpY8aQ95T3hzB7PUSy5eKAQNAXLPfLp", "voter": "0xF0CDd24937eB08242626cC60593A2299c279A68a", "created": 1610426437, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQvcxEh7sKufH6Cga5PUW3TJYdqAfu4YQ9gQKiaVdRTA9", "voter": "0x6413365Cd5c7BB69F9fe6222c34A4d9cA6740334", "created": 1610424421, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSMJex2HQfTAE1hASSuX1wa6CDXrHH8fAeEax7S27eS1f", "voter": "0x5E0b772FC4E58C470CE4551EeF2391A3B5dA5bb4", "created": 1610424399, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth"}}]}
