This vote is to gather community sentiment and can be voted on if you are bonded or staged in the DAO.\n\nAfter long discussions, we think we have narrowed down our options to two paths :\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Start work on a V2 migration\n\nFirst, we will need to hire a solidity coder and pay this person with the Community fund wallet (ZCF multisig). Solidity coders are hard to find, and we need to make sure the transition is bug free. Thus, we cannot give a clear ETA (release date). This Zai V2 would primarily consist of a token migration that resets the supply back to a certain ratio that will need to be decided in a future poll (4:1 ? 5:1 ? 10:1 ? etc.) Here is an example: you have 4 ZAI V1 worth $1, you then migrate to 1 ZAI V2 worth $1. This V2 could also feature new and improved coupon mechanisms. \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Start work on a V2 migration AND temporary re-peg to 0.25 (4 ZAI = 1 DAI) \n\nThis solution is the same as #1, except that while V2 is being developed, we temporarily re-peg to 0.25 (a quarter, so  4 ZAI = 1 DAI).\n\nRe-pegging to 25c will in essence return us to the system dynamics that were in place before the inflation bug. 100mm tokens attempting to reach a peg of $1 is equivalent to 400mm tokens attempting to reach a peg of 25c. It's not pretty, but it's the most stable, quick, easy, temporary fix we have at our disposal *right now* until we can finish programming the migration. After this patch is deployed we can begin the longer process of implementing and migrating to ZAI V2. The temporary re-peg is only one line of code and it has the highest guarantee of having no effect on other system mechanics.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 None of the above. Something else than re-peg and/or V2 migration.\n\nContinue the debate on what to do.", "choices": ["Start work on V2", "V2 and temp. re-peg", "None of the above"], "start": 1610517600, "end": 1610744400, "snapshot": "11638156", "state": "closed", "author": "0xEE3A8cFf0ed07B2301d873272B61Acd70C97BB7D", "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth", "name": "Zero Collateral Dai"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUGk2ifcQKb4QzZJdZKqSNoEuHgHhauRzWDSPKMP3bn4o", "voter": "0xaf2e2b04a09dDa42bfc592CF501AfF511f1251Bb", "created": 1610637643, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfJLSw8PTCRbXnrhs3q35rwaVDtgs8hGcEWAm5kgnStdv", "voter": "0x290e9603dDE0B26A65842C84Dd75845d87C63607", "created": 1610615396, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTbcdRasr2pQ9TfNtkxXBA5jWNh4yVJbWDYRcSFdarLC6", "voter": "0x05F4ccFe7747aA083954F54C6c67e93882c6428C", "created": 1610589871, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRwAkRDu8knG2Dctkgh94bxGv32Vik45uxKMaFXfdeS2w", "voter": "0x18b3eeDadC9A4a6d35905D4A416DfFF239F067d5", "created": 1610578807, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfU39MdpP3c7T5mZ86Z1RNgSqHChfhQDW3uYUPnTs8kUs", "voter": "0x9E64B47bBdb9c1F7B599f11987b84C416C0c4110", "created": 1610578688, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "zaifinance.eth"}}]}
