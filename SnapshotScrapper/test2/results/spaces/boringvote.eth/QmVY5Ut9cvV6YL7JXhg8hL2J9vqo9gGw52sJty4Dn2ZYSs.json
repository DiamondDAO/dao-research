In other words, the pledge ratio is adjusted to 50%.\n\nThe primary motivating factor for this proposal is that the underlying assets are overly pledged and act as a psychological barrier for people who may want to enter the BoringDAO ecosystem\uff0ccommunities consider replacing pledged assets with decentralized insurance cover.\n", "choices": ["Yes, reduce the oBTC asset ratio to 150%", "No, keep the oBTC asset ratio 200%"], "start": 1606309200, "end": 1606395600, "snapshot": "11327594", "state": "closed", "author": "0x583e5fC0751c717557e3D1568207969CeD14892D", "space": {"id": "boringvote.eth", "name": "BoringDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
