Those who held a Tile, a Squiggle, or 75 FWB were invited to attend. \n\nOur goals were to:\n- Celebrate together IRL\n- Introduce people from the NFT.NYC crowd to TileDAO\n- Open a door for cross-DAO collaboration with SquiggleDAO\n- Demonstrate what we can do as an art-funded, decentralized community without any corporate sponsors\n\nIn the days leading up to and during the week of the party, ~20 Tiles were minted and TileDAO gained around 100 followers on Twitter. More importantly, partnerships with SquiggleDAO and FWB were strengthened, and TileDAO is now a more meaningful project for a lot of new folks who attended.\n\n## Spending\nAll in all, the party cost 13.27 ETH to put on, which we are splitting with SquiggleDAO.

Instead, the costs were paid up front by Peri and SquiggleDAO.\n\n## Proposal\nThis proposal is to refund Peri for TileDAO\u2019s half of the party expenses, which comes out to 6.635 ETH. If this proposal is passed, Peri will be paid out that amount during the next funding cycle.", "choices": ["Approve", "Do not approve"], "start": 1637096400, "end": 1637269200, "snapshot": "13628696", "state": "closed", "author": "0x63A2368F4B509438ca90186cb1C15156713D5834", "space": {"id": "tiledao.eth", "name": "TileDAO"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x50c6c6c7fee8193336910addbd248a190e473992939e564e32a520db9793d06a", "voter": "0x4032aB8d5ccEd1444240c7b973F36d712981FB00", "created": 1637267711, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tiledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdTiGXX4QKdqty3WUa7Vjvq37vrRz9Q2ehS5q494u3hJw", "voter": "0x266D9ea940c667d97485089981f886963185c63d", "created": 1637158173, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tiledao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xbe7d9fc9794e8acca908356679050b50a0876f00f45735121226127b91e74520", "voter": "0xd0d8897BC14a64A79047C70117dd5362CA4C2d17", "created": 1637119848, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tiledao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x55fb10e164fc27049f6af505b48b64528fe69a9723b8b937666f2dda2d72e1c4", "voter": "0x1396a34a60A247e97E2eD6e9A7c43e8cAd7a24dE", "created": 1637117294, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tiledao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1a68e06343d2ab79710d675fea82af137307c89264b2e3090ad1a926c645e885", "voter": "0x85AAffc1F91cD828C82D5d0006B38C34b05917e9", "created": 1637100835, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tiledao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x049eae580ff557b5dcbaff49a4f3470883eef85660019624fdab6d21dd41e33f", "voter": "0xe7879a2D05dBA966Fcca34EE9C3F99eEe7eDEFd1", "created": 1637099609, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tiledao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xdafdff011b8c1e7e8b4f690894691f848fabaa23e85103c96da01f55ba76b10f", "voter": "0x7cc4E967242E1CaD92152d47AE0bB9169e97d553", "created": 1637097542, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tiledao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xafe572bdde4d3c003fc355266432885d6c3f4c3489c091274abf7b168f16d1c3", "voter": "0xf7253A0E87E39d2cD6365919D4a3D56D431D0041", "created": 1637097238, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "tiledao.eth"}}]}
