Currently we are using the public domain Noun DAO images which anyone can use; this may be a problem in the future as the NFT space expands and others use those images.  If we can come up with a creative way to update our visuals then we simultaneously mitigate the risk of being \"lost in the crowd\" while gaining the opportunity to become a blue chip NFT ourselves.\n\nCollectively we have made great choices so far which is why I'm ok if this is shot down. Having said that I ask that you keep an open mind while considering this idea because I think we could do something really special...\n\nHere\u2019s a few strategies\n_________\n\nA)\nHire a digital artist to design and update all 424 traits. The artist should be somewhat relevant with a healthy following on social media.\n\nThe old image is kept as an unlockable feature of the NFT only for the owner to see.\n\nB)\nWe commission relevant artists each year to update the 424 traits using some agreed upon style or brand\u2026\n\nThe new image would now represent the owner\u2019s staked position and the old image would become a collectible NFT that can be sold without losing their staked position. The collectibles could also include whatever new technology that can be coded into NFTs at the time\u2026 Each year the art and tech would increase, making the long term holders wealthier in more ways than one.\n\nC)\nWe update each of the 5 properties with interpretations of those traits by world renowned artists over the course of a few years...\n\nCurrently this is what we have...\n\nbackgrounds (2)\nbodies (30)\naccessories (137)\nheads (234)\nglasses (21)\n\nJust imagine how much the intrinsic value our NFTs would increase if we came up with a creative way to commission Beeple to do the 2 backgrounds, Ken Sugimori (original Pokemon artist) to do the 21 glasses and Banksy to do the 30 bodies... \n\n_________\n\nI think this is possible if we leverage our community and market the idea properly using the resources in J0xrdan\u2019s proposal \u201cHead Dao Consider Dao Innovation before next purchase\u201d... \n\nJust the idea of it could spark a huge amount of interest in the project and increase the floor price drastically, only benefiting our DAO economics. \n\nIf we make the effort to update the NFT images with unique and valuable art then we have a greater chance of creating a timeless brand that will continue to attract new community members.\n\nIf this idea is crap then vote crap :)\nIf you think this will make getting $HEAD even better then vote YES :)\n\nEither way, this community fucking rocks!\n\n-MittMill \n\n\n\n", "choices": ["Yes let's explore how to update ", "No let's just keep it the same"], "start": 1637348400, "end": 1637607600, "snapshot": "13637522", "state": "closed", "author": "0x71C3D4Ff7AF73d8383773D2932F8376D0f0A4cCa", "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth", "name": "Head Dao"}, "votes": 15, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x45dc305ae08f13021594d53d93848a5e2bdb709c23b0c3e0d35e8d526df0eb75", "voter": "0x0FCB7f4540012E3193458865C77BBC755514ed08", "created": 1637595720, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc9f0ae396addcefcdc9c41fa070ff06b81ba65efc3cd13be8896262cf6e00f42", "voter": "0x420dF1161B18a978C81C8f1AeC17672DCe84F58B", "created": 1637573335, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1c7345b279a44ed4383dafcc65515535d1d22baf04d6891dc853a7eb678878a4", "voter": "0x73da1C2C4709FaeD6ee7A863AE45Af8379fC6Fc9", "created": 1637570662, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x69dc138603caa6ad41b38fc7a8027b4f95cdb986a9ece07de47a40bb2f42bcf3", "voter": "0x6db544fd9955cD40aC47F7ae78F596F7eD679510", "created": 1637546608, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x7d4bfb5a1b0e5d1f4096704a7d9ba853a400acf4b231dd723800089064aafa62", "voter": "0x2F9B38b1ed0945e5406E060D7aD58190B820b58e", "created": 1637546096, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc7906e0d888d599e1fceca0711e07e818145cc8980b0a556c68c89553400524d", "voter": "0x04054E9aea6Fdf7B520296c9438d6991ca2CaA5C", "created": 1637493488, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1680c934f42c048ab70e541d9b50e08c69781f32ea6c5df5f1352d70261aebb1", "voter": "0x091d3ead6EA7EcA568513E9C3381A64Afe7cf628", "created": 1637420276, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x8996f2ab77ef61be493876dfbe89b8f69fe17ff5e8a1da72dd14e01796646c8d", "voter": "0x3da0262e3ded93C6D67A7F75D8bfF673F7Ff5287", "created": 1637417302, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc74e43210dc159152e83b32ebb814b71ee2ac77c5047f42be7b8945d1dc7b5e9", "voter": "0xd25eD72253d92e680867026732629025Ac46031e", "created": 1637391232, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x360e8896b878990c4217c22b2a64039afbd303fac60c852e9f705ee98f75f141", "voter": "0x934C89aEFD7EF7bbb3077A5c4Bae7220250F2615", "created": 1637379767, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x25827e72a06c6a6ca6e9e99ba81cb688671dcea81277e71bc8eb106e6ec33143", "voter": "0xceDFDf7444B9508E2be6671eC0D015037D6A7F62", "created": 1637376549, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x4b5c8e4b078adb12a97c0ea8aea85c27fca79071618506cfbffba1d951009904", "voter": "0x8FdacC6BA2e5f0E1F22dE4F0fCC03De1Bda11817", "created": 1637366994, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x02e46a59ccf64e030ac1f7bb9a6aa1de3acf1eee232cbe55f2c1dadd0bb1368f", "voter": "0xC3dc6e62B8D9A14c9F62F4D54d2f6a37a1f4c186", "created": 1637362681, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x283c6f4dc14f27e6236b13111b62a2597f35868ebddba597f5d6f1fc601f0827", "voter": "0x79B6126f361e1284Af140d30e69d42BD82f9B0A8", "created": 1637361683, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x4d3acb239806407c91a183c0930e011c6a7d312510a0604a57a101e85c3533f1", "voter": "0x487FcF3eCe090719935a873b9276EfF3a4226754", "created": 1637353788, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "theheaddao.eth"}}]}
