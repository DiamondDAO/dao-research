There are multiple connections between the contributor\u2019s public wallets and the exploiting (bad actor) wallets.\n2. There are multiple connections between the contributor\u2019s public github account and the second github account that was used to do work on these other projects that had funds stolen from them.\n3. There are connections between the contributor\u2019s github account and Ethereum wallets to other github accounts and other Ethereum wallets that have worked on, deployed, or been the recipient of funds from projects that many would consider to be scams, or at the very least, suspicious.\n4. There is circumstantial evidence including chats and a voice recording that seem to match characteristics of the contributor.\n5. The distinction of whether this contributor was personally responsible for these actions or unwittingly caught up in the actions of other individuals ultimately does not matter. Their involvement shows extremely bad judgement and is a serious security risk for YAM.\n\nThere are additional decisions that need to be made regarding the payment for previous work Jason has done and continued membership on our discord that need to be answered by the YAM community.\n\n### Abstract\nContributors are paid in both stablecoins and YAM based on their approved compensation proposals. The YAM is streamed over 3 months and the stablecoins are paid retroactively every month for work done over the past month. Jason\u2019s YAM stream has ended and will not be renewed. His payment in stablecoins typically would be paid in the monthly on-chain vote with the rest of the contributor\u2019s payments.\n\nThe question here is whether the DAO thinks that Jason should receive payment for his last month of work. He has performed the work and tasks that he was given over the last month, and the exploit of which he is accused occurred on the 3rd of November, after the period of work for which he would be paid.\n\n### Motivation\nThese decisions are either beyond the scope of what the core contributors believe they should be deciding upon or are unclear on the best course of action. We feel our best way forward is to put these questions to the DAO as a whole and follow the will of the YAM token holders.\n\n### Specifications\nThe outcome of this vote will be followed by the contributors with the power to carry them out.\n\n- If the vote to pay Jason is successful, he will be paid for his work done in October in the next on-chain proposal\n- If the vote to pay Jason is unsuccessful, we will not be included the next on chain proposal.\n- If the vote fails to meet quorum then Jason will be paid for his work done in October in the next on-chain vote.\n", "choices":
