The rEarn concept is designed to utilize this liquidity (or a portion of it) to provide the greatest benefit possible to the RENA token and ecosystem.\n\nThis is a proposal to decide whether to continue the development of the rEarn concept or to move development power elsewhere for Renaswap, thru different community proposals.\n\nIf approved, in the future, there will be a proposal that decides the removal of all (or a portion) of the existing DAO-held RENA/ETH liquidity to be used as the ETH to seed rEarn. (this will not affect user-staked LPs).\n\nrEarn concept link:\nhttps://link.medium.com/KeIs60qjJib\n\n\nFurther Propositions\n\u2014\nTo be clear, this proposal is not to decide on yield strategies and the specifics of the removed liquidity. That proposal will come at a later date once the rEarn contracts have been completed and audited.\nThis is a Approval/Denial vote to determine if the DAO wants to support this concept, and confirm the devs should remain motivated on this task and not utilized elsewhere.\n\nVoting\n\u2014\nYou will be able to cast a ballot for only one of the following options:\nApproval or Denial to determine if the DAO wants to support this concept, and confirm the development should remain motivated on this task and not utilized elsewhere.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nIf this proposal is Approved\n\u2014\nThese are the current working strategies for utilization of DAO liquidity for rEarn. We welcome the community to further discuss these strategies, and or to propose new strategies that will maximize our DAOs capital efficiency.\n\nOnce the ETH/RENA LPs are split, the RENA tokens removed from the LP liquidity will not be touched and will just remain idle until a possible future proposal vote is made for their utilization.\n \nThere are a few options for utilizing the removed ETH for the one or multiple strategies. \n\n+ Swap 100% of the ETH into USDC\n+ Put 100% of ETH into Aave and borrow USDC against it\n+ A mixture of the above points\n+ Other (community ideas)\n\nThe benefits and disadvantages for each of the above options vary based on the overall crypto market. The first option would be ideal if the market were to head bearish, while the second option retains 100% exposure to ETH, meaning it\u2019s ideal going into a bull market. Further discussions on these strategies will happen or not, for now the choice is yours.
