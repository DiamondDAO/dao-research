This means that as the sOHM rebases the amount of sOHM within the wrapper will increase while the wsOHM will not, therefore the value of wsOHM will increase with each positive rebase of sOHM.\nOnce the wrapper is deployed we can list wsOHM/RENA and give RENA exposure to both the yield of sOHM but also the price movements of OHM.\n\nAdding Liquidity: Remove ~ 18% (roughly $1m) of the protocol-owned ETH/RENA LPs and swap the ETH side for wsOHM to then provide wsOHM/RENA liquidity on Uniswap. Roughly 500k worth of OHM would be acquired via bonds / DCAing, and then staked for sOHM and wrapped into wsOHM, this wsOHM would then be paired with the remaining 500k worth of RENA on Uniswap or Sushiswap.\n\nNote: Current RENA/ETH liquidity owned by the protocol is 86%.\n\nBenefits:\nBy using a wrapper for sOHM we are building additional utility onto the OHM ecosystem and positively benefiting the relationships between OHM and RENA. sOHM stands for Staked OHM, and is a rebasing token that currently represents OHMs ~7k APY. This means that the number of sOHM\u2019s in the wrapper contract would be increasing each rebase by around 0.3%, which is about 6.1% per week.\n\nIf the sOHM in this wrapper contract is increasing by 6.1% per week, then wsOHM will be worth 6.1% more sOHM each week. This means that by creating a wsOHM/RENA liquidity pool, RENA is now exposed to both the yield of sOHM and also the price movements of OHM, this exposure would allow for arbitrage opportunities between wsOHM/RENA and ETH/RENA Uniswap pairs.\n\nNegatives: By creating the wsOHM/RENA liquidity pool we are exposing the RENA token to both the positive and negative price impacts of wsOHM. Meaning that if the value of wsOHM goes down then so will the value of the RENA In the pair and vice versa.\n\nTLDR\n\nCreate a frontend to wrap and unwrap sOHM\nSwap roughly $1m protocol owned RENA/ETH LPs to RENA/wsOHM LPs.\nsOHM has been consistently providing around 7k APY, and by pairing wsOHM/RENA into LP, RENA is exposed to both the OHM token and rebases of sOHM. It\u2019s expected this exposure would help volume by enabling arbitrage opportunities between RENA/wsOHM and RENA/ETH liquidity pools.", "choices": ["Approve", "Deny"], "start": 1634211000, "end": 1634470200, "snapshot": "13884077", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1dac25A83C1daeC849852f03887d22610df279a9", "space": {"id": "rgov.eth", "name": "Rena"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNq1cN3tDr1KLGCQQnLDnhRTUdbmTz2treaET98RB2oYV", "voter": "0xCCE15daB72f0c54014f2fE8ebCd2085D3721Df03", "created": 1634387796, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWWfQyQpsstK25dejhQ6rwM8qYjChCyWgNM2GMSzs8aex", "voter": "0x129cca1010a2c3Dcf18E917671EACEF109a08f5c", "created": 1634319416, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYdEvqT9GUCoFEu4zgF7iG6Yfckah6eFm3e2SaWRniMTm", "voter": "0xa1027632c4Dbc44Aa37a15f2EC76fe688e7FD83F", "created": 1634280689, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSaD817Z3gJzV395BpjfHrNBVxNNx1AHdvRYKicckxJtQ", "voter": "0x1dac25A83C1daeC849852f03887d22610df279a9", "created": 1634218406, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmcxs5p7A9RqUJMMWS4zXHdFgeQah7wDqJ5TaMMvUpNn25", "voter": "0x45B9B9552bba4A8612796Cc8466F24404D6bec15", "created": 1634212034, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYFLCs8V6m9P4VxUsBbSTvLiADu8rvdaySUkGECgzVMKA", "voter": "0xee282F4F299999d0e201618418D4d756D04A727d", "created": 1634211566, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}]}
