{"id": "QmRATrwhLkbTd6aXPyQyCpZGJs9DYUf1ePtRcGWhhoJPGD", "title": "Space Tokens rGOV Proposal", "body": "Currently, the ITS & RENA deployer addresses hold the following tokens:\n\n250 BETA\n250 RHO\n2,500 KAPPA\n2,500 GAMMA\n2,500,000 XI \n\nThese tokens were funded by GeometricLabs to list BETA, RHO, KAPPA, GAMMA, and XI pairings on RenaSwap as the first new listings exemplifying growth of the RENA ecosystem. RENA from the pairs, after using 2.5% for the RENA fee distributor to reward RENA/ETH LP stakers, will be sent to GeometricLabs which will be half used for adding Liquidity to BETA, RHO, KAPPA, GAMMA, and XI on Uniswap.\n\nProposed RenaSwap pairs:\n\nrRENA/BETA\nrRENA/RHO\nrRENA/KAPPA\nrRENA/GAMMA\nrRENA/XI\n\nBecause BETA, RHO, KAPPA, GAMMA, and XI do not have transaction taxes, these RenaSwap pairs will need to be set up differently from the currently existing ones. This is because the pairs will not be able to receive tokens from their trading volumes.\n\nThis means that we will need to create a holding contract that holds each of these tokens and drips them into their pairs over time. For example, 2,500,000 XI dripped into an rRENA/XI pair would run out over time, meaning we need to decide on how fast to drip the XI into the pair. \n\nWith 2/3 of the tokens dripped into the pairs over the first 3 months and 1/3 of the tokens dripped into the pairs over the next 3 months, there will be sufficient time for users of the BETA, RHO, KAPPA, GAMMA, and XI tokens to claim pixels displayed on future video streams of in space art transmitted back to Earth. The BETA, RHO, KAPPA, GAMMA, and XI tokens that users claim pixels with will be sent back to the RenaSwap pairs ongoing to ensure sustainability of the pairs beyond the tokens currently in the deployer.", "choices": ["Approve - Greek Token Pairings", "Deny - Greek Token Pairings"], "start": 1630789200, "end": 1631048400, "snapshot": "13181594", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1dac25A83C1daeC849852f03887d22610df279a9", "space": {"id": "rgov.eth", "name": "Rena"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWkk6tAx7PMSdor8yXkUdtZ36tR7vRqWDtrNSF7HEuyBJ", "voter": "0xc215d9CdB2836cEFfFd688D1e0f8e91f2Baf2ec9", "created": 1631038714, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc6z36v55kDB3LyzP9XCq5eSUwUg6EqKzSrpBphLcUmUR", "voter": "0xea7609063D5b3DA5481F16C8FEb6D8A0E8499C56", "created": 1630983433, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT2At577Ya9Rs7LuMzb4p38a95nrMbbbvnDLP8GhL3ZQG", "voter": "0xa42D7630f3Fa0b4e9DAae44bf4A1d1566b4AEb46", "created": 1630863358, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTrJLph6vUmmRhw2kFN2BWzo398JoBxSUSRrj2HNx5EpM", "voter": "0x45B9B9552bba4A8612796Cc8466F24404D6bec15", "created": 1630846768, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNWrkEnasV1Km4BECezLN6uFx8SnT66qqDBWfnmz4TN22", "voter": "0x85a2851172634C2d95655E1aF75A85Cf61507531", "created": 1630842604, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "QmepHadJrPVon4GMWkA2uPFTEkooadc39BP5yVEJb5wJuk", "voter": "0x129cca1010a2c3Dcf18E917671EACEF109a08f5c", "created": 1630795207, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}]}
