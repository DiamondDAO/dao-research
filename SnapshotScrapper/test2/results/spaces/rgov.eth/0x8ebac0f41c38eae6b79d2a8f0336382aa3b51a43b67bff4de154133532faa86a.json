This proposal is to migrate some of Rena\u2019s liquidity from the ETH chain to Fantom\u2019s L2 and allow for users to trade and interact with Rena on Fantom.\n\nSteps to take:\n\nRemove $1m of RENA/ETH LP from Uniswap ($500k RENA $500k ETH).\n\nUse the $500k ETH to DCA into FTM, over five days.\n\nList roughly $1m RENA/FTM liquidity on Spookyswap.\n\nCurrently, the RENA and RenaSwap FTM contracts are in testing to prepare for deployment on Fantom. This proposal is to acquire the FTM needed to list RENA/FTM liquidity on Spookyswap and to deploy the RENA, Rebalancer, Fee distributer, and RenaSwap contracts on the FTM chain.\n\nBy pairing RENA with the FTM token, RENA would become partially exposed to the price movements of $FTM.\nIf this proposal is passed, RENA will soon have paired liquidity with 3 different tokens, and therefore be partially exposed to the prices of ETH, wsOHM, and FTM.", "choices": ["Approve", "Deny"], "start": 1635750000, "end": 1635966000, "snapshot": "13545559", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1dac25A83C1daeC849852f03887d22610df279a9", "space": {"id": "rgov.eth", "name": "Rena"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x3e64851d637a105389ead16ec9211b36ec5752250668f7e6a110d3e8fc7731b0", "voter": "0xa1027632c4Dbc44Aa37a15f2EC76fe688e7FD83F", "created": 1635910065, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "0xcae29c4ce9e1b7b59897e493c07dc1bc78248ef128b1654c5f07bcf169a79af3", "voter": "0xA2B3A2457FA55812f813Ab33C03260A93Db397Ca", "created": 1635909901, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "0x80f2ee8695bbb44d3a85894f7030b848071cc19047769d80617dcb62faebb201", "voter": "0x129cca1010a2c3Dcf18E917671EACEF109a08f5c", "created": 1635804118, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "0x13132349033686679049b2e770eb2714544fbaef4e34118b163aed4e5b66074c", "voter": "0x45B9B9552bba4A8612796Cc8466F24404D6bec15", "created": 1635797049, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "0x666a6a710d5feab73097180ff454cc5dc860dcadac4ef2e37aa4345fde14b0e5", "voter": "0x7f8c1877Ed0DA352F78be4Fe4CdA58BB804a30dF", "created": 1635785821, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb9ac1b4fdcc1d5c0088bef006738c325528f421ece299e3442b738a31041a50d", "voter": "0xee282F4F299999d0e201618418D4d756D04A727d", "created": 1635769556, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rgov.eth"}}]}
