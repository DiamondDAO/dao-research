At certain price thresholds, the maximum amount of vested sake that can be sold by the rover increases.  But if these price thresholds are never hit the Sake would essentially be locked in the rover forever. Only 500k of the Sake would not be subject to any price targets.  So based on our proposed price release schedule, if the price of Sake never passes $0.10 then the remaining 4.5M sake can never be sold.\nIf the price only reaches $1.00, then up to 1.5M Sake can be sold if the 1yr vesting timeframe has passed.  If Sake hits $1.00 one month since rover deployment only 1.5M/12 or 125K Sake can be sold.  \n\nBasically, before any Sake can be sold by the rover, it must first check the price of Sake to see what the max sellable amount of Sake is according to the price release schedule + vesting schedule.\n\nFor simplicity, we can just use the current price of Sake from the SAKE/USDT pool. Ideally we would use a 7 day price avg for the price threshold, however if doing so requires introducing too much smart contract complexity we are okay using just the current price of Sake as the price threshold.\n\nThe link below contains the price threshold vesting schedule: \nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/750958406747160707/765981327404433458/image0.png\n\n\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1602698400, "end": 1602743400, "snapshot": "11058688", "state": "closed", "author": "0x199c1a8A643FC543F6983a941F221BEBe358959e", "space": {"id": "sake", "name": "SAKEVOTER"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
