With 280,000 active members, the page is a portal for enthusiasts to learn about the latest innovations in the Eth, Defi space and yield farming.\nThe page has a unique banner program that is build on the blockchain.  Here is a quick description of the banner :\n\n(a) The owner sets the price for the banner\n(b) They pay a daily tax of 10% by burning Donuts\n(c) If the owner cannot pay the tax, the price goes to 0\n(d) Anyone can buy the banner at its advertised price\n(e) The owner cannot refuse to sell it at that price\n\nDonuts are issued every month to the members of the sub and is currently priced at : https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/donut/  .  Donuts can also be purchased on Sakeswap / Uniswap.\n\nTo replace the current banner would require 50,000 Donuts (~$200) and a daily tax rate that will burn donuts built on Aragon DAO : https://client.aragon.org/#/ethtraderdao.eth/\n\nBeing a member of the SAKE community and a SAKE holder from the start, I believe this small investment will help accelerate / promote usage of SakeSwap and will have a positive impact on the SAKE price.  Upcoming NFT projects can also be advertised to a very active target market that is already familiar with most tokens and trading pairs.\n\nYour Vote will determine if we should invest in promoting SakeSwap to a very active Core audience with an expected high ROI that would reflect in Staking / Usage of Sakeswap / and price increase of Sake Token.", "choices": ["YES - Lets Promote Sake and Bring more Users Immediately", "No - Do not Promote Sake"], "start": 1604167200, "end": 1604775600, "snapshot": "11162215", "state": "closed", "author": "0xb77f10994e6328aDCD8eaf539473246feB9EDaAc", "space": {"id": "sake", "name": "SAKEVOTER"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPB46Fd6T7uVqR9spz6Fjixa2P65Rrd7nT9YrYkLk6qnR", "voter": "0x8d4f291680e60C63C057d3Af2980EC7895985c52", "created": 1604441818, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sake"}}, {"id": "QmevR4mUDXfr2crcdh6S8omdftRuv4CsCiFYnzQLxTmQqQ", "voter": "0xcc55a426d4221D299A4586Aaa0cEf6E5C12783A4", "created": 1604269947, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sake"}}, {"id": "QmVWcYaeunG5vEPevCoiiuq3SeeLCVej5BZjHRXWwykjTK", "voter": "0x9b25A5998Ab8A5f72A4F72bc30d062952e281f55", "created": 1604249638, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sake"}}]}
