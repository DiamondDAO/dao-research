{"id": "QmWR4JXzfxWzBmtTakiccPxQkFzuu411TS8NxX5ncB32Cb", "title": "SIP-02 Start S Token Trading Mining earlier.", "body": "We propose to start S Token trade mining earlier than planned. The original plan was to start trade mining when yield farming ended. SakeSwap AMM is live now which aims to bring trading slippage capture and a more efficient incentive mechanism.\n\nS Tokens offer traders rewards for contributing price discovery to AMM. **With S token, traders can farm SAKE as trade subsidies which grows SakeSwap transaction volume and lower down transaction gas fees.** And each pool has a corresponding S Token.\n\nSince the AMM is online, trade mining can help the platform attract more volume and increase APY of transaction fee/liquidity. All related information is available on SakeSwap info page{https://info.sakeswap.finance/}.  The trade mining mechanism is as follows.\n- All traders will receive S Token by trading on SakeSwap. \n- S Tokens can be deposited in the corresponding trading mining pools. (eg. SAKE-ETH S Token for SAKE-ETH pool)\n- Each trading mining pool has a different allocPoint which is decided by pool trading volume. \n- Anyone can increase the allocPoint of a specific pool through burning SAKE token directly. The burned SAKE will be weighted together with the pool volume.\n\nAt the first stage of Trade Mining, **1M** SAKE from SakeLock is needed to reward traders. And it will last for one week. It is planned to launch on 5th Oct.\n\nSo, the vote is: \n- YES. Let\u2019s start Trading Mining with the support of SakeLock.\n- NO. I don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\n\nIf there are more positive votes than negative ones, the proposal will be implemented.
