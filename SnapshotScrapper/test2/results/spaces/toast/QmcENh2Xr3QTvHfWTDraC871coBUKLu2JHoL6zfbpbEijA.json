And currently, each 1x boost also results in a 0.5x bonus boost (500 weight points) to the TOAST-ETH UNI-V2 LP pool, and a 0.5x bonus boost (500 weight points) to the HOUSE-ETH UNI-V2 LP pool.\n\nWe are proposing these changes to the system:\n\n1. As of ETH block 11070000 (around 2 days from now), each creation or boost action will instead add 2000 weight points (2x) to the created or chosen pool. Every 40000 blocks (around 6.5 days), this amount will increase by 1000 weight points. So the pool creations/boosts will increase to 2x, then 3x, 4x, and so on ... with the aim to encourage more participation as more time goes on.\n\n2. The TOAST-ETH UNI-V2 LP pool's bonus boost will be changed to be equivalent to the creation/boost amount at the time \u2013 when this amount is 1x, it'll be 1x, 2x when 2x, and so on \u2013 in order to encourage more TOAST-ETH liquidity.\n\n3. The HOUSE-ETH UNI-V2 LP pool bonus boost will stay at exactly half of the creation/boost amount at any time \u2013 0.5x when the creation/boost amount is 1x, 1x when the creation/boost amount is 2x, etc.\n\n4. The HeadChef contract will stay as upgradable at this stage and will later be locked down.\n\nPlease select \"Vote For\" if you agree with everything, or select \"Vote Against\" if you disagree with even a portion of this proposal.", "choices": ["Vote For", "Vote Against"], "start": 1602730800, "end": 1602817200, "snapshot": "11060000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6cef9EcD79e87F8a88143eE9b464119bB296dA8b", "space": {"id": "toast", "name": "Toast.finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
