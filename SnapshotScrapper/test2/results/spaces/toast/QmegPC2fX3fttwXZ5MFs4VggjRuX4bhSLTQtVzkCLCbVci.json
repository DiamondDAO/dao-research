This means that as more pools are created and boosted, each boost becomes less powerful as 1000 weight points makes up a smaller proportion of the sum of pool weights.\n\nThis proposal is one possible solution to this issue:\n\nEach pool creation or boost action will now set or increase the pool weight by 2% of the sum of total pool weights. This means that pool creation and boosting actions will have a fixed power as a proportion of the total sum of pool weights.", "choices": ["Vote For", "Vote Against"], "start": 1603479600, "end": 1603652400, "snapshot": "11114305", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6cef9EcD79e87F8a88143eE9b464119bB296dA8b", "space": {"id": "toast", "name": "Toast.finance"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUHXj8CUozqPjtqRSGyRvNk5hp2rfcdMs1WJsHxy7Jca8", "voter": "0x54cd970F3e31907cc51a1E9Bf21F94f13194407E", "created": 1603579461, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "toast"}}, {"id": "QmNnREMRjQTvS4vMeLvPn3o6pD6fyidgzHKLepMWvAskkr", "voter": "0x3e04c4e8f6B72c3B07848ceeeaB26BE63017B3D6", "created": 1603553567, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "toast"}}, {"id": "QmVzRQWMao6o5G4zSkrxVXcJ6CTNRRnKvjkvEp9rSH9EKU", "voter": "0x3AfaBF42E03e0FDc3008E10Dd013304F9E530DE2", "created": 1603539881, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "toast"}}, {"id": "QmSZDr2bNaUDzK9eqkUe73HvniViHjg8UfCLeVNvzgrVGo", "voter": "0x23EEBb090C430783Bf0665478ea6d5793B44a3c3", "created": 1603539569, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "toast"}}, {"id": "QmaS3pgs6BJp9Jj7p69G3PCSPCSTxu1UWy9CqXYUhVQgsJ", "voter": "0x8ECF7044b1Ee52dc79BD069324C1B24Fb5a23460", "created": 1603534405, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "toast"}}, {"id": "Qmb5ACJZ9Vjb17zingxFUBQVGM2mL36XFVnzLMgcZVuDQi", "voter": "0xE2e275200F521de1BD1BC9f930514287c7FeEe93", "created": 1603490657, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "toast"}}]}
