This means that as more pools are created and boosted, each boost becomes less powerful as 1000 weight points makes up a smaller proportion of the sum of pool weights.\n\nThis proposal is one possible solution to this issue:\n\nInstead of boosting by 1000 weight points (which we refer to as \"1x\"), the amount of weight points that a new pool has, or a pool will be boosted by, will now be an amount that goes up over block time. Starting at 1000 (1x), and then going to 2000 (2x), 3000 (3x), etc, forever. This will be roughly a rate of a 1x increase each week.", "choices": ["Vote For", "Vote Against"], "start": 1603479600, "end": 1603652400, "snapshot": "11114269", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6cef9EcD79e87F8a88143eE9b464119bB296dA8b", "space": {"id": "toast", "name": "Toast.finance"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmeupAiV2p4hZA4sqpfAa2QxPQRcN1n2ZgQ95iNcqiNRfX", "voter": "0x54cd970F3e31907cc51a1E9Bf21F94f13194407E", "created": 1603579566, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "toast"}}, {"id": "QmPDsHCuo43uBcU9gqXoPyRMTRf4sPvrYSZPV5d5K7rtwi", "voter": "0x3AfaBF42E03e0FDc3008E10Dd013304F9E530DE2", "created": 1603539828, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "toast"}}, {"id": "QmX2xCjyjp1AvKZnN8JiB2BC2pG8ALcjE7AAUCNCUwbPyW", "voter": "0x23EEBb090C430783Bf0665478ea6d5793B44a3c3", "created": 1603539524, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "toast"}}, {"id": "QmSH3VJidSDTYnB4X5eLw1Kfi5zRWL8a3droZbG7FrL2Mr", "voter": "0x8ECF7044b1Ee52dc79BD069324C1B24Fb5a23460", "created": 1603534356, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "toast"}}, {"id": "QmRj1BUCbpQMwRts1KirMX9paZEkAX48qGuZtHcALb8FGz", "voter": "0x4c59E1B80ca11215c2a53b39651825663048a7ED", "created": 1603499996, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "toast"}}]}
