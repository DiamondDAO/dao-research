The event is hosted by Uniswap Grants in partnership with ETHGlobal.  The ETHGlobal team has reached out to Polywrap DAO members to be sponsors as well as judges and mentors for the event.  \n\nThis proposal is to determine whether we want to participate as sponsors, and if so, the amount of `WRAP` we'd like to contribute to the pool.  It has not been determined how these tokens will be distributed, but we will work closely with the event organizers to plan this out.\n\n## Event website\n[UniCode - A Community Hackathon](https://unicode.ethglobal.com/)\n\n## Motivation\nThe Polywrap team has a history of partnering with Uniswap Grants on a number of events and projects.  Our team has done two talks, worked on the Uni v2 polywrapper, and recently accepted a grant to begin the Uni v3 polywrapper.  Participation in this hackathon will be a great way to continue our partnership with the ETHGlobal and Uni Grants teams, as well as meet and mentor great engineers and project teams.\n\n## Proposal Options\n\n#1: Zero tokens sponsored (Reject proposal)\n#2: 10 `WRAP` tokens\n#3: 15 `WRAP` tokens\n#4: 20 `WRAP` tokens\n#5: 25 `WRAP` tokens\n#6: Other (Please message keeevin#7783 on the Polywrap discord for other suggestions)", "choices": ["Reject Proposal", "10 WRAP", "15 WRAP", "20 WRAP", "25 WRAP", "Other"], "start": 1634065200, "end": 1634238000, "snapshot": "13402290", "state": "closed", "author": "0x937F5b32Bc3cafcd1B02462F93e6AE5a843f6C6A", "space": {"id": "polywrap.eth", "name": "Polywrap"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmbVsQarFqyuos8YASVfMVv7oxKXsws5x5AMbwTciG5Fu8", "voter": "0xB1B7586656116D546033e3bAFF69BFcD6592225E", "created": 1634079219, "choice": 5, "space": {"id": "polywrap.eth"}}]}
