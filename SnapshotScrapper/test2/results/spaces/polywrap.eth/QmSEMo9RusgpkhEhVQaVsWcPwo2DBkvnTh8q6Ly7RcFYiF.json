We'll have regular calls with our partners.  We'll also invite them to join our Discord where they can ask questions in #help.\n\nFor our project, we choose partners who believe that Polywrap is a solution to their problems.  It's a no-commitment program, but in the past, some benefits to our project include getting feedback on our code and docs.\n\n## Motivation\nComposable Finance is building an Ethereum cross-L2 communication SDK for a multi-L2 future.  We believe their use-case is very unique and that a Composable Finance polywrapper can be more beneficial for their project rather than a JS SDK.\n\nJordan and I spoke to their team on Oct 8 2021.  They have a great understanding of our project and how it can benefit them.\n\n## Proposal Options\n#1: Accept\n#2: Reject", "choices": ["Accept", "Reject"], "start": 1634065200, "end": 1634324400, "snapshot": "13406279", "state": "closed", "author": "0x937F5b32Bc3cafcd1B02462F93e6AE5a843f6C6A", "space": {"id": "polywrap.eth", "name": "Polywrap"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmfDvsQP34PMuJuBYVUspZkYZGjxC4pV2SmaFiiybRFA7Q", "voter": "0x5E642f8C81DE40E7e49b6a2B606dFB94A005bC44", "created": 1634083086, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "polywrap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdNbRY45vvxHpn5Kn1fWSLWj4qTQjc4W2DTdD63HecijJ", "voter": "0xB1B7586656116D546033e3bAFF69BFcD6592225E", "created": 1634079274, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "polywrap.eth"}}]}
