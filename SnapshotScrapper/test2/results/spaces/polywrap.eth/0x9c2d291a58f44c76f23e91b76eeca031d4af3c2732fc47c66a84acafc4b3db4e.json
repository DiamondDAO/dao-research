In addition, we're proposing to match the GR11 grant with our own Polywrap DAO grant.\n\nThe DeFiwrapper team will use the funds to continue development on the `Defiwrapper` SDK and build a \"Crypto Portfolio\" dApp with it.\n\u200c\n\n### **Motivation**\nThe objectives of this grant is to:\n- Fund a project that showcases a complex, DeFi-related use-case of Polywrap\n- Get feedback on Polywrap from DeFiwrapper developers as they work on the project\n\n\n## **Specification**\n\u200c\n### **Overview**\n\u200c\nIn the section below, we discuss the history of the Defiwrapper project and the benefits of providing a grant to the DeFiwrapper team.\n\u200c\n### **Rationale**\n\u200c\nThe DeFiwrapper is a collection of different DeFi related polywrappers such as DeFi SDK, Coingecko, etc, created by Niraj (@Dr. Manhattan) for the [Polywrap Round 3 Mini-Hack](https://github.com/polywrap/mini-hacks/issues/11).\n\nThe team is also working on creating a demo dApp named [Crypto Portfolio dApp](https://github.com/Niraj-Kamdar/crypto-portfolio) using the Defiwrapper which will be a DeFi aggregator, with functions like:\n\n- Display various components of their DeFi position. \n- Display the balance of each token\n- Deriving the balance of underlying tokens for positions on Uniswap, Maker, Curve, etc.\n- Graphs and charts to represent this data\n\nIn September, Polywrap entered Gitcoin's GR11 hackathon with the DeFi SDK, and received a grant to continue development on it.\n\nThe project is now separate from the Polywrap DAO and is known as \"DeFiwrapper\".  We are interested in providing a matching grant to the DeFiwrapper team.  \n\nThis project would showcase what the Polywrap tech can do, while also serving as a great standalone DeFi aggregator dApp.\n\u200c\n### **Technical Specification**\n\u200c\nIf this proposal passes, we will implement it in three steps:\n\n1) Create a separate Gnosis Safe to be owned and managed by the DeFiwrapper team\n2) Transfer the GR11 funds (which are in zKsync) to this new Gnosis Safe\n\nzKsync: [https://zkscan.io/explorer/accounts/0x8c3fa50473065f1d90f186ca8ba1aa76aee409bb](https://zkscan.io/explorer/accounts/0x8c3fa50473065f1d90f186ca8ba1aa76aee409bb)\n\nAs of Mon Nov 15, the amount is roughly $13,192.24.\n\n3) Polywrap DAO will send a matching grant for the approximate stable coin equivalent to the newly created Gnosis Safe\n\n\u200c\n### **Copyright**\n\u200c\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n\n", "choices": ["Accept", "Reject"], "start": 1636995600, "end": 1637082000, "snapshot": "13621952", "state": "closed", "author": "0x937F5b32Bc3cafcd1B02462F93e6AE5a843f6C6A", "space": {"id": "polywrap.eth", "name": "Polywrap"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x2d807797d5e41af47259a0375e489ce2b5f858c08dc452019e90e5cc1554e147", "voter": "0xB1B7586656116D546033e3bAFF69BFcD6592225E", "created": 1637029653, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "polywrap.eth"}}, {"id": "0xba55e24c08e457cf33897798c78175cf563d01dd661e1aafe55fd2a3bc3654b0", "voter": "0x937F5b32Bc3cafcd1B02462F93e6AE5a843f6C6A", "created": 1637028201, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "polywrap.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0fb383d8a6754b8a9903473a405f45fb3c5c78ea6fa2648a047802486fac9cf4", "voter": "0x37341cbb14c5F128A70B149726ad8B2CE6F4C793", "created": 1637003898, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "polywrap.eth"}}]}
