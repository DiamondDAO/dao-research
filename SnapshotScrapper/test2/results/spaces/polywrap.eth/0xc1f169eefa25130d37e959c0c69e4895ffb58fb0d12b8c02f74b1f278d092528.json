We'll have regular calls with our partners. We'll also invite them to join our Discord where they can ask questions in #help.\n\nFor our project, we choose partners who believe that Polywrap is a solution to their problems. It's a no-commitment program, but in the past, some benefits to our project include getting feedback on our code and docs.\n\n## Motivation\nDeHive Finance is building a multi-chain asset management protocol. We believe their use-case is very unique and that a DeHive Finance polywrapper can be more beneficial for their project rather than a JS SDK.\n\nKevin and I spoke to their team in Oct 2021. They have a great understanding of our project and how it can benefit them.\n\n## Proposal Options\n1: Accept\n2: Reject", "choices": ["Accept", "Reject"], "start": 1635786000, "end": 1636218000, "snapshot": "13532869", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB1B7586656116D546033e3bAFF69BFcD6592225E", "space": {"id": "polywrap.eth", "name": "Polywrap"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xe6f4f566ba250fe492684f92a5f7bd83dd8e867eddebd607d2d14338e1c8f066", "voter": "0x61FfE691821291D02E9Ba5D33098ADcee71a3a17", "created": 1636130750, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "polywrap.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb0cb25add88f2ee3ef0901c37b2351d98cca15d11cd2a63fd632bafa26cd262e", "voter": "0x937F5b32Bc3cafcd1B02462F93e6AE5a843f6C6A", "created": 1635794505, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "polywrap.eth"}}, {"id": "0x27745e9363323247426fe989d812275aa029e26d54ee597980767979938f339b", "voter": "0xB1B7586656116D546033e3bAFF69BFcD6592225E", "created": 1635793107, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "polywrap.eth"}}]}
