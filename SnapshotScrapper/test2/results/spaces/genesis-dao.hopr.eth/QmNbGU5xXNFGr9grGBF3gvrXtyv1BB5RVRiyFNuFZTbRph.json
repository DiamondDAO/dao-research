It was not created in order to decide how much of the token its participants shall receive for themselves.  So let's cut the greed.\n\nSome of us have been around since the beginning, participating in all test nets, while others just barely made it to the last test net.  Does it mean some deserve more than others?  No, of course not.  Some were just luckier than others to have discovered HOPR early.  Those who just learned about HOPR yesterday and now can't be part of the Genesis DAO are just unlucky, but they will no less believe in HOPR's mission and future.  They would have been running a test node, if only they knew about it.  So please, none of this \"I was there, where were they?\" entitled gatekeeper non-sense.\n\nYes, we ran test net nodes and our contribution was very important, I do not want to undervalue this in any way.  The team at HOPR appreciated it immensely and we can be proud of ourselves.  However, let's also not overstate those contributions: We ran a node for a while, did some tasks, filled out some forms.  It wasn't that hard, it wasn't too crazy.  I personally don't feel like this tiny bit of work makes me deserve a huge chunk of the initial token volume.  It's volunteering, which by definition is without reward.  That's how open source works.\n\nTherefore, I daringly propose:\n* We past test net contributors get all the pride that comes with having been around before many others! We're freaking legends!\n* We past test net contributors do not directly get any of the 85m token.\n* The 85m token FULLY go to future main net node runners as additional incentive, distributed throughout a fixed time period.\n\nThe main net is going to need nodes, many nodes, the more the better. I believe particularly rewarding the first main net nodes is a great way to bootstrap a large and stable HOPR net. The exact details can be discussed later on. The general idea is something like this: The 85m token will be linearly paid out over a ~6 month period in a probabilistic manner to online nodes.  Something like 50 token to a random online node every 10 seconds.  Since the number of nodes will likely always be increasing, individual rewards will diminish over time.\n\nThis way every past and future contributor will have a fair chance to get rewarded for something that truly helps HOPR in the future.  Sounds good?\n\nThank you for your time!", "choices": ["Yes, sounds good!", "Nah."], "start": 1612177200, "end": 1614596400, "snapshot": "14507648", "state": "closed", "author": "0xF3551c1d8AC61569E482ABc05EefAE4ccCEF32C1", "space": {"id": "genesis-dao.hopr.eth", "name": "HOPR Genesis DAO"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmeERqjgfGAowRjxMYMAYBDRJ2qP9uPiSxDLwpKnS68qgS", "voter": "0x0bfE0d2B62ae5D381C73613Ea300De7bbb5f3024", "created": 1613254423, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "genesis-dao.hopr.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT5k8z4JxybHKJkicD5FYiQyDHxBm3bFF2We77ibmf6F2", "voter": "0x7EcE5640a9acd50b004EB11cB771ece2bADe8017", "created": 1613238087, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "genesis-dao.hopr.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVCtJhs2akMdbHE16oNQqj8s8TQqfWdvy5azitinLYh8B", "voter": "0x4c468b4379b7258A0De44D9ec8fEECCFcFa1555A", "created": 1613143438, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "genesis-dao.hopr.eth"}}]}
