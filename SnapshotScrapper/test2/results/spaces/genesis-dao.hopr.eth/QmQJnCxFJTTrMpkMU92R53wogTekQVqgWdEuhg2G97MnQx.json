", "body": "100% of the total supply the Genesis DAO controls (8% of total supply) should reach testnet participants but we must also make sure that we're aligning our incentives with the success of the Hopr. \n\nReading Sebastian's post (below) made me realize that we shouldn't make things complicated thinking about offering an IDO from our allocation or be concerned about dex liquidity. I believe that our role as testnet participants and a member of the Genesis DAO is to help provide a solid decentralized foundation for the Hopr network. \n\n\"First, and most importantly. This is NOT a sale. The HOPR Association is not selling any tokens, and will not directly benefit from the token distribution. These tokens have been transferred to the DAO as compensation for the work performed by DAO participants during our various incentivized testnets.\" - Dr. Sebastian B\u00fcrgel \n\nhttps://medium.com/hoprnet/bootstrapping-decentralized-governance-the-hopr-genesis-dao-fd4e6a2eb41b\n\nI'm not here to provide exact specifics (we can decide on that later if this proposal gains consensus) but the most logical and simple way is to allocate as much as possible to incentivize people who will:\n\nRun a Validator. \n\nAs a decentralized project, Hopr's success relies on having as many solid validators running at launch to increase throughput and level of privacy we can provide. We've all participated in the testnets so nobody else is better equipped to fulfill this role than us!\n\nDoes it mean we ask the team to program a way to keep our funds locked for a certain period (i.e. 1 year) but we can use it to run a validator while having the flexibility to do what we want with the validator rewards? Perhaps. Should we have a portion that is distributed with no restriction from day 1? Maybe. But my proposal is to put an emphasis on incentivizing Genesis Dao to run a validator in order to align ourselves with the success of Hopr.     \n\nThis is the way.", "choices": ["Yes.
