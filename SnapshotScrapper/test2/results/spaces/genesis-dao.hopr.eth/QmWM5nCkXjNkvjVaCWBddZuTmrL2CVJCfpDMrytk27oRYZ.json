Yes you lucky donkey:) Entrance into presale is usually hefty.\n\n We all part of this DAO and its in our best interest to preserve the integrity of the project and vote with longevity in mind. Thanks\n\n25m HOPR community whitelisted for Genesis DAO. Personal cap applied to each valid testnet applicant. Presale on xDAI.\nToken price will be determined using a proposal voting measure from 0.03-0.05 xDai per token. If cap is not reached within 24hrs, remove the personal cap and enable the testnet community to purchase the remaining tokens. \nIf cap is not reached in 72 hrs, close presale and rollover remaining token to HOPR Balancer LBP. Token is vested for 1 yr and linearly released over a 12 month period. Able to stake and run validator with vested tokens\n\n45m HOPR Balancer LBP: this is open to anyone, does not require any KYC and starts a secondary market price finding. The proceeds from the presale start the LBP. Starting price should be at least $0.3 and fall from there over 72hr period. This tokens will not be vested\n\n5m liquidity mining on Uniswap: Distributed over 6 months, this incentives liquidity providers.\n\nBefore you whine about it, you are been offered a chance to be a presale investor for under $500 per candidate, that what your time as a testnet candidate earned you. That's taking into account that there's approximately 3000 testnet candidates.
