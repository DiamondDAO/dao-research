He shall also be the presiding officer unless the Committee decides otherwise.\n-    (2) Jintao, a past committee member and multi-sig signer who is on retainer for our critical infrastructure but is not a salaried worker, shall be a member for his experience with both development and compensation in DeFi\n-    (3, 4) Two members to be appointed by Larry the Cucumber, so long as they are not a subject of the current review, at least one of which must have experience with hiring and compensation in DeFi\n-    (5, 6, 7) Three DillDao members to be be selected by a Discord vote of the DillDao, which shall last at least 30 hours for the nominating process and 30 additional hours for voting. The beginning and ends of both the nominating process and the election shall be posted in #Announcements and #DillDao to allow for the broadest possible participation.\n\nFor the candidates to the (5, 6. 7) seats specified in `PIP-39`, the nominating process was carried through Discord where DAO members are verified. A total of six nominees formalised their candidacies for this by-election.\n\nThis governance action is to elect the (5, 6, 7) seats in the committee. \n\n## Nominees by the DAO\n\nThe following Discord users have been nominated and seconded by DAO members. After accepting their nominations, they have each prepared a short paragraph on why they should be elected to serve on the committee. Each nominee is presented in the order in which their nominations were formalized.\n\n### Cerunos#0001\n- Dear fellow Pickle friends, I have experience in management, many different committee, ethics, payroll and dev environment. I was first a lawyer in tax / corporate law. After that I studied finance before becoming a wealth manager. I've been a crypto \u201cearly\u201d investor since 2017. The last 4 yeasr I have created a Family Office in \u201ctraditional\u201d finance, participated in creating and managing an IT company and am currently building a third entity specialized in digitals assets investment in Switzerland. My employees and associates say I\u2019m attentive to others' positions and fair in my decisions. Integrity, fairness, and transparency are my motto in life. Pickle is my main investment in Crypto nowadays, and also the best community I have ever been part of. That\u2019s why I will do my utmost to make it grow well into the future. When Pickle brothers are calling to arms, we can\u2019t ignore the warcry!\n\n### Clintos#9235\n- Hi all! I\u2019m a multi- business founder, Director on a couple of boards, VC/Angel Investor and DeFi Degen since DeFi Degens existed.  My companies have grown from a starting payroll of 4 to over 600 staff, including over 40 software/web developers.  Was early enough in Pickle when it was about stablecoin pegs and had to migrate and rescue funds manually in Etherscan.  Lost 20k in the pDai hack and more than that in subsequent dump and IL in suicide pool.  But despite that, believe this community is the best in DeFi, big brains, big hearts and great frens and Pickle remains one of my largest homes to keep crypto capital.  I\u2019m always looking for opportunities for the protocol and look forward to helping Pickle hit its stretch goal this year. Thank you all for making this DAO what it is.\n\n### bwar#8815\n- Hi. I'm Bwar. I write code for a living, but not this kind of code. I've never hired anyone and have no experience in management or hiring. But I am not ignorant of typical wages in software development. I've re-organized several weekly meetings in my day job with more efficient agendas, tend to keep people on topic while still respecting the need for people more knowledgable than myself to take the lead when we dive into the details, and have been told I'm pretty good at it. I have a strong love for the protocol, have made code changes in two of the Repos, and rewrote the docs (they're Live, by the way, thanks @Sevenz!). My main goal is to ensure the committee gets all the information they need to make a decision, with as little interruption to the devs' business as is reasonably possible.\n\n### Merpenduous#6044\n- Hi all!  I work for a giant tech company as a middle manager in a semi-technical group.  I have under 20 people that report to me currently.  The size of my company is such that I don't engage on the payroll/hr side of things, but have a massive wealth of templates from which to draw. I've flipped some of our job descriptions to match Pickle, and could get a sense for software developer salary at any level in virtually any country.  I'm all-in on Pickle, like crazy all-in; when I was nearing liquidation I kept Pickle and let my Chainlink go.  I tend to think outside the box A LOT, mostly because I'm not certain where the box is.  My oldest son's nickname was Pickle a decade ago (which drew me to Pickle in the first place), and I have a Larry the Cucumber t-shirt!\n\n### Cipio#4528\n- Hey Everyone! I have been investing in crypto since summer of 2017. I am a software engineer and integrator for real time systems. I do not have a lot of experience with management or payroll, but I do working with extremely talented engineers. I am also a huge fan of Pickle and will do whatever it takes to make sure the protocol is successful. I believe in a strong compensation package which would include a solid base pay, and a bonus structure that scales based on the individuals performance and how successful the team is at hitting specific financial goals. Honestly all the people up for election are amazing. Any subset of the people running will do a phenomenal job! Make sure to vote! Let\u2019s go Pickle!\n\n### Wunderbernd#3514\n- Hello, I am Wunderbernd and I study Business Informatics, so I have a little bit of knowledge in Computer Science, Digitalisation and Economics. I am in crypto since the summer last year, I mainly invested in stocks and traditional investment products before, but the more I learned about the crypto space, the more passionate I became and I increased my exposure. Pickle is one of my biggest positions, because it fits the traditional investment approach (low p/e ratio, growth, disrupting industry etc.). I lack the experience of the others, but my passion for crypto and the space might exceed theirs. In the crypto space you don't have to know all the things, you need to put in the work. My main goal is to bring this protocol forward and work out a compensation structure that is fair and competitive, but also incentivizes good and hard work for the protocol.\n\n## Voting Method\n\nFor this by-election, we will be using the **approval voting** method. On the relevant snapshot, each DILL holder can give as many approvals as there are options to choose from (i.e. 6 in this case). Each approval vote carries the full weight of the DILL holder's balance. The 3 members with the highest approval will be elected to the Select Committee. In order to make the election competitive, we suggest you make your vote count by approving 5 or less candidates \u2013 ideally, 3.", "choices": ["Cerunos", "Clintos", "Bwar", "Merpenduous", "Cipio",
