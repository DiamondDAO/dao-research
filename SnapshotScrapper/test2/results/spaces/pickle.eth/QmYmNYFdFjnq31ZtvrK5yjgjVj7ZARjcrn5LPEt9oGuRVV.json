He shall also be the Chairperson of the Committee.\n-    (2, 3) Two members of the Core team, appointed by Larry the Cucumber.\n-    (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) Six members of the DILL DAO, whose interests do not conflict with serving in the Committee (i.e. by being part of the personnel of this DAO or an officer or staff of another DAO or DeFi protocol), to be elected by DILL holders after an internal nomination process.\n\nThis governance action is to elect the (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) seats in the committee. \n\n## Nominees by the DAO\n\nThe following Discord users have been nominated and seconded by DAO members. After accepting their nominations, they have each prepared a short paragraph on why they should be elected to serve on the committee. Each nominee is presented in the order in which their nominations were formalized.\n\n### Clintos#9235\n- Hi all! I\u2019m a multi- business founder, Director on a couple of boards, VC/Angel Investor and DeFi Degen since DeFi Degens existed.  My companies have grown from a starting payroll of 4 to over 600 staff, including over 40 software/web developers.  Was early enough in Pickle when it was about stablecoin pegs and had to migrate and rescue funds manually in Etherscan.  Lost 20k in the pDai hack and more than that in subsequent dump and IL in suicide pool.  But despite that, believe this community is the best in DeFi, big brains, big hearts and great frens and Pickle remains one of my largest homes to keep crypto capital.  I\u2019m always looking for opportunities for the protocol and look forward to helping Pickle hit its stretch goal this year. Thank you all for making this DAO what it is.\n\n### Scotty#0001\n- Hello m8s, my name is Scotty, and I am a recovering Pickle maximalist. I have a first-class degree in business economics and a drop-out during postgraduate research into behavioural economics. I dropped out to focus on cryptocurrency and my cryptocurrency community called Spacestation, which I created in March 2017. The community still lives on today, in fact, we have recently set up a community-led DAO-controlled treasury fund which was entirely donated by our community members, which currently sits at around $400k. A big step for me personally. And a step I would not have taken without the experience and confidence that I have gained during my time at Pickle; being around such wholesome and professional people is a great classroom. Vote for me if you want a part time therapist and a community obsessive on the SCCOC.\n\n### MadMikeHoare#0111\n- Hi! My name is Marcel Wolff and I\u2019m running for DILLDAO because I believe PICKLE has strong potential to be the premier De-Fi protocol.\nI am currently pursuing an MBA at the Kellogg School of Management. Previously, I worked 7.5 years at the Vanguard Group, both in client service and IT product management roles. I am also a director on my undergraduate social society\u2019s alumni board. My career experience as well as my experience on a board of directors would help the SCCOC develop an optimal process for hiring and compensating developers to make sure we can hire top talent; the abilities and vision of our developers\u2019 are key to increasing PICKLE\u2019s popularity and TVL. \nIf elected I would prioritize developing an industry competitive offer for new developers, processes that ensure transparency around spending, and durable governing structures for SCCOC and DILLDAO that ensure we are pursuing our fiduciary responsibilities.\n\n### Entbeard#1372\n- Hello fellow Pickle jar denizens! I have 5 years experience in IT technical support, 3 years in special needs education, and a year in high end audio sales. As you can see I have a broad spectrum of experiences, and skills that will lend themselves well to the success of Pickle Finance. I am a highly process oriented person who values above all authenticity, transparency, and truth. Many who cross my path have complimented my excellence in leadership, communication, and empathy for my fellow human beings. Pickle was my first foray into defi, and I haven\u2019t strayed far from this wonderful community we have built together. I will endeavour to nurture, and grow the same sense of belonging, and community that I have experienced with Pickle. As my friend Cerunos has, I will also answer the call for Pickle in its hour of need!\n\n### tokani#9542\n- Hello everyone, I'm tokani. While I don't have experience with hiring or treasury management, I hope to bring an alternative perspective with a focus on Pickle's governance structure and general DAO procedures. I have spent several months over the past two years reading, researching, and theorizing about the structures of various types of governments across the world, both past and present, as well as alternative forms of governance and societal management. This research is actually what introduced the concept of a DAO to me, directly leading me to Pickle. I've stuck by Pickle through thick and thin, and am fully committed towards the success of our protocol. As such, I believe a fair, equitable, and forward-thinking governance structure is critical; not only for our success, but for the success of DeFi as the Future of Finance.\n\n## Voting Method\n\nAs this proposal is non-binary, we are using Snapshot's \"ranked choice voting\" or \"instant runoff voting\" (IRV) algorithm to count the votes.\n\nYou can find a [short explainer of IRV in the Snapshot Docs](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types#ranked-choice-voting-irv). Below is a simple diagram from Wikipedia.\n\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/IRV_counting_flowchart.svg/1920px-IRV_counting_flowchart.svg.png)\n\nThe voting power is still DILL i.e. 1 DILL equals 1 vote.\n\nVoters will rank their preferred choices for a winning slate of 3 candidates (out of the 5 nominees), the slate with the most votes wins.", "choices":
