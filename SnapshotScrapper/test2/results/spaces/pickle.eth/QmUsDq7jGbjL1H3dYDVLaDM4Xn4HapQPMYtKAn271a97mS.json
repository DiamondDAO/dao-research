The core team, having worked together in the development of DILL as well as releases of new jars, has thus identified a gap in its engineering capacity and would like to fill it by onboarding an additional smart contract developer.\n\n### Proposal\n\nEquivalent to previous engineering packages, the Pickle core team requests approval for a budget of $156k ($120k from the stablecoin reserve and $36k in $PICKLEs from the Smart Treasury) in order to fund the hire for a year.\n\n### Hiring Process\n\n-    A call for candidates will be posted on this forum, Pickle's Discord and social media, and other relevant channels.\n-    A hiring committee consisting of the Pickle core team (@Larry_Cucumber, @0xkoffee, @Unlock_Target, @purplezky, @leekuanjew, @chimaera, @anoniminis), independent multi-sig members (@jintao, @Mah_Dills), and Brinery members (@Rooster_Cogburn77, @sifu, @yyctrader) shall assemble to evaluate candidacies and conduct interviews.\n-    The hiring committee shall deliberate internally and come to a decision according to its own procedures. Any selected candidate(s) shall be extended an offer by a member of the hiring committee. \n\nThe job advertisement, below.\n\n---\n\n# In search of: Solidity/Vyper Smart Contract Developer\n\nPickle is a yield aggregator and automated yield farming protocol on Ethereum. In its short 6 months of existence, it has gone from an elastic stablecoin farming experiment to a Yearn ecosystem member with projected revenues exceeding $6M/year. \n\nWe are one of the smallest yet most daring teams in the DeFi space. We take pride in developing and releasing novel strategies for yield farming vaults, and in creating deep partnerships with the protocols and teams pushing the boundaries of this new and open financial system that is being built on sound, programmable money. We follow best-in-class security procedures, yet retain our \"degen\" instincts intact.\n\nWe are looking for a driven and enthusiastic smart contract developer to help us bring about the next evolution of Pickle Finance. With the aid of the Pickle core team, you will design, develop, and test the strategies and yield-generating products that will delight the growing Pickle userbase. Kudos if you are also willing and able to help contribute to our frontend, analytics, or process automation development.\n\n## Role and Responsibilities\n\n-    Design, test, and implement new yield farming strategies and tests\n-    Design, test, and implement peripheral contracts for Pickle jars\n-    Design, test, and implement peripheral mechanisms to the Pickle protocol, including governance\n\n## Must-haves\n\n-    1-3 years of experience with Solidity or Vyper, including deep familiarity with the Ethereum development stack (e.g. Hardhat, Ethers, The Graph)\n-    A deep understanding of the Ethereum Virtual Machine\n-    Prior experience deploying smart contract systems in Ethereum\n-    Deep familiarity with the foundational principles of software architecture, design patterns, test-driven development, data-driven programming, and development in an Agile environment \n-    A collaborative, can-do attitude, and a deep appreciation of the [Scrum values][1]\n\n## Nice-to-haves\n\n-    Formal training in maths, physics, computer science, computer engineering, or electrical engineering (Degree level or above)\n-    Prior experience as a developer in DeFi, particularly in yield farming applications\n-    Prior experience deploying smart contracts to non-Ethereum EVM implementations (Fantom, Binance Smart Chain, xDai)\n-    Familiarity with React, Next, and TypeScript\n-    Pickle connoisseur \ud83e\udd52\n\nPickle welcomes all qualified candidates to apply. Whether you are public or pseudonymous, please provide ample evidence of relevant work and experience for consideration.\n\nCandidates with experience and credentials well in excess of requirements will immediately be considered for a more senior role e.g. Delivery Lead, Development Lead, Solutions Architect. Conversely, candidates with lesser experience or time availability may be considered for a more junior or part-time role.\n\nTotal compensation for this role will be **$156,000/year**, as follows:\n-    A *base salary* of $120k/year, which will be deposited in an interest-bearing stablecoin (i.e. `aDAI`) and streamed over [Sablier][2].\n-    A *vested tokens* component valued at $36k/year on the date of hire. An equivalent amount of `PICKLE` tokens (according to the day's low price in CoinGecko) will be earmarked from the Smart Treasury and streamed over [Sablier][2] after a 3-month cliff.\n-    All other benefits and bonuses available to core team members, which will be extended to new hires upon completing a 3-month probation.\n\n[1]: https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-values\n[2]:
