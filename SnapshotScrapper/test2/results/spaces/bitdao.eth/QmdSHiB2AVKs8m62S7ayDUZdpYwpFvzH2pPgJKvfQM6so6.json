So I think the threshold should be 5M or lower.\n\n", "choices": ["10M", "5M", "2M"], "start": 1632034800, "end": 1632423600, "snapshot": "13248579", "state": "closed", "author": "0xF85a0bB760F322aaB57383C67a8cc596C13c3E55", "space": {"id": "bitdao.eth", "name": "BitDAO"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXYcw6cNzjuSLLeRur27GVEcrpn4rK3AydAHQWT8S54dN", "voter": "0x000000000A38444e0a6E37d3b630d7e855a7cb13", "created": 1632133698, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "bitdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX1anaj3tVjQ2sj4bynJZvydZpqToxYmAntRtbJjXCCLJ", "voter": "0xF85a0bB760F322aaB57383C67a8cc596C13c3E55", "created": 1632063896, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "bitdao.eth"}}]}
