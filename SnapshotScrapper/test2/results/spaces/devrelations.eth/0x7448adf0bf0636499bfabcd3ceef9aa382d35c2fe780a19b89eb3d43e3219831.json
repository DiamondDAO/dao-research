For past 2.5 years I was working as a full stack developer with JS stack mostly, but there was python, swift and data engineering involved as well. What brought me to Rarible is a project which I\u2019ve created for my friend Mike who is an artist to create his own NFTs and sell them. Thanks to successfully implementation you can now see his pieces also in Rarible :slight_smile: (here\u2019s the site if you\u2019re interested: jawzart com). I\u2019m thriving to be content creator specialising in tutorials for new people in Rarible space. I\u2019ve already written blog post about my journey with jawzart. For the measurements purpose here is the list of my potential responsibilities:\n\n- Coding two high quality tutorial projects to showcase every possible aspect of Rarible protocol usage I will do it with NextJS & Typescript. NextJS because I personally think that it has super clear structure which allows users to jump right into what interest them. Typescript in order for them to be sure about types we\u2019re using\n- Documenting it in engaging and educative way as articles (I can also make youtube tutorials)\n- Hosting projects live\n\nCan answer questions about usage if those would appear\nResume: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Z30tiNxq6qUE9srZtip8-w93t1EwFri/view?usp=sharing\nGithub: kolberszymon\n\nTime commitment: 17 hours / week\n\nCompensation: 3000$ / month in ETH preferably.\n\nAddress: (Binance ethereum address) 0xceac5dd3d2fd407b623ad0fca85d3fda1adfe092\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestion / complaints ping me up.
