They basically just say let\u2019s be nice to each other.\n\nIt\u2019s not something that I\u2019d think is necessary for you to read but it might be good that we have this small document that everybody had previously agreed on and that also is something that unites us.\n\nThis vote would mean that you have read the code and are going to adhere to it, same as your fellow community members and think it is in the best interest for the DAO.", "choices": ["Agree", "Rejection"], "start": 1620756000, "end": 1620835200, "snapshot": "12414484", "state": "closed", "author": "0xf6B5FD8e2CAC43987DE603ce7942E09e2DC8A2C9", "space": {"id": "guoxinchen.eth", "name": "guoxinchen"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWf7rtYPEwHwTpsitCADe4LiwBvCYYkJFyd4FVrdbDS8H", "voter": "0xf6B5FD8e2CAC43987DE603ce7942E09e2DC8A2C9", "created": 1620756875, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "guoxinchen.eth"}}]}
