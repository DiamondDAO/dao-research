{"id": "QmZnQDpffWbLobeo6vS814JdkZPyy6hAeQ8RBsjGdd9pGt", "title": "(Updated): Increase the AMM's FISH Burn rate", "body": "I am reposting this proposal and hoping to void the original, in light of the issues encountered at the hands of AFKs over the past week.\n\nIn addition to that, I would like to extend my sympathies to all affected, and to the team who have dealt with several difficult blows over the past few weeks. I've since doubled my FISH position, and do so with every confidence that Polycat has an extremely bright future ahead.\n\n(Heard about some of your upcoming partnerships btw, bullish)\n\nFollowing the recent setbacks, I would like to rescind the events of the original posting, particularly in knowing that PAW right now is struggling as a mintable AMM token, disincentivising liquidity providers.\n\nIn being confident that the team do have plans in place for FISH in the near future, I believe it would be in the community's best interests to continue to allow PAW to maintain the highest amount of burn rate possible.\n\nWith additional incentive being made available to liquidity providers in focusing on growing the PAW ecosystem, we should see a higher rate of providers arrive on to Polycat; and with more providers/more traffic incentives, we'll see more swaps which will overall allow for a higher rate of FISH burn in the long-term.\n\nCurrently, with PAW being weak and our TVL dropping a little lower, I believe it would only serve our short-term interests in wenfish wenpump wenlambo if we were to proceed with allocating a higher burn rate to FISH. Long-term, there's still significant time left in this bull market where holders can benefit greatly by doing everything in our power to grow PAW, which in turn will rapidly increase the burn rate of FISH naturally.\n\nAlso, I know there's a snapshot strategy to respect before posting these, but.. I don't like doxxing my fishies on telegram :( Maybe update local vaults/pools/tanks to periodically snapshot for manual inclusion? ..if that's possible? :E\n\nAlso I just noticed I made a mistake in my previous poll, and accidentally asked for 0.6% burn rates. Hooray for unusable AMM fees! I uh, assume everyone just knew I meant 0.06%, and weren't voting for platform suicide.\n\np.s: wencatpics, wenmoon, wenlambo, wen AFKsLynching, wenpartnerships, wenevergrandeblackswan, wenbiggermaticpawtank\n\n(seriously the matic tank is getting low though)", "choices": ["Revert: 0.12% paw / 0.02% fish", "Move to 0.08% paw / 0.06% fish"], "start": 1631790000, "end": 1632481200, "snapshot": "19181130", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4c928d82e7D0E6D943616997c263991C54666D22", "space": {"id": "polycatfi.eth", "name": "Polycat Finance"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVm721j5yVoSNdaHaktHf3zBFuviNfwNtFxpTpLPbbsUP", "voter": "0x4b2E2e76920E6219344246ad51EE3E38c6744814", "created": 1632256504, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "polycatfi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVgga7HCBiP92U4qwmMF957kRJDuJXSTYzwXzW1BdYS6F", "voter": "0xD23720733e6EEB01152E89091972057D699d684E", "created": 1632201864, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "polycatfi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmagMp6BWDn1spDPtptTGecdFpQVfXNVpY3KH1RoiX45NA", "voter": "0x59eF06E5557f1e472e13B31531ad6B5BC4dD6eBC", "created": 1632124405, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "polycatfi.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmas3LMRDwCAetAzPZLmpm8DXJtXoKgw8wCNE6pgcmvJb2", "voter": "0x49a5492FDFe5AcC966dD5f41310dfDfe8dAA349C", "created": 1632119147, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "polycatfi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQJiTXmSoQar3tu9AuScumPAb9vm2AzRbBtGMt5rPQ7n5", "voter": "0x245Fa3163858b3c397D0c874D2544E921897Fac2", "created": 1631922119, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "polycatfi.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme1thdCGrqFAxCz8MLyYruhW7YQdFsn2ZzKwvwjZ9WDLk", "voter": "0xBC04652B7657E9a7C2778f04B425683955DE88C1", "created": 1631887104, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "polycatfi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmckRHMGmvjADwy1ktS4NmAtX7wk5EUqLuCDE9iKXxn8at", "voter": "0x14b649189Df1c7427e9A7763adE2DDBCdd803031", "created": 1631881671, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "polycatfi.eth"}}]}
