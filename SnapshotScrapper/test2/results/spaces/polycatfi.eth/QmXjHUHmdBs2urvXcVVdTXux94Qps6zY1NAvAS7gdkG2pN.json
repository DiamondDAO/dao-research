The risk here is very high due to the unexpected nature of ICE price. It has recently stabilized but due to how young the token is, carries major risk. We expect potential dips as low as 30% of the dividend to drop in this vault, with low potential of upswings.\n\nMedium risk: The expected vault is WMATIC/BANANA, generating 0.60% a day. The risk here is the potentially highly variable price of BANANA, which could drop the amount we have in our dividend vault. However, it has been mostly stable. WMATIC is also a risk as it's not a stablecoin, but is regarded as very low risk due to it being the main token of the chain. We expect potential dips as low as 15% of the dividend to drop in this vault, with medium-low potential of upswings.\n\nLow risk: The expected vault is WMATIC/DAI, generating 0.19% a day. It is considered low risk as one of the token pairs is a stablecoin, and the other being the main token of the chain.\n\nSafe risk: IS3USD or whatever stablecoin pairing is higher.\n.\n\n.\n\nThis vote will be a weighted vote and the percentage of each choice will be the percentage of the dividend allocated to each risk-level vault, rounded to 10%.", "choices": ["High risk", "Medium risk", "Low risk", "Safe risk"], "start": 1628784000, "end": 1629388800, "snapshot": "17917214", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1cb757f1eB92F25A917CE9a92ED88c1aC0734334", "space": {"id": "polycatfi.eth", "name": "Polycat Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
