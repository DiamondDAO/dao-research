Cosmic could maybe implement a roulette game, coinflip game or even a dice game. If people lose the game a part of the cosmic could get burned making cosmic a even rarer coin thriving the price up. Another % of these coins could be used to buy other tokens like : ADA, ETH, etc these will then be put in a temporary farm so people can farm these other tokens with their cosmic adding on another use case for cosmic and making people wanna hold their farmed cosmic. \n\nI love cosmic dont get me wrong but i feel like the native token doesnt have many use cases in it except for selling there is no incentive to hold it cause we cant do anything with it except farm so why should we hold our farmed rewards? adding a game section / having limited time pools for other tokens that only can be farmed with cosmic would make the coin more wanted.
