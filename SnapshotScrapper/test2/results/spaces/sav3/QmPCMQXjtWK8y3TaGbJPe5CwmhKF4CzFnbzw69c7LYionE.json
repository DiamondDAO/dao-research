It is all SAV3 no part ETH. When the 4% Share goes to be made into an LP pair with ETH. ETH must be purchased so the following occurs.(maybe not technically but effectively. As best I understand)\n\n4% SAV3 tax is split into two\n2% SAV3 is swapped into the ETH Pool. 2% sits and waits\n2% ETH now paired with the waiting 2% SAV3 goes to LP pool.\nNote - Every single transaction is taking 8% and I am probably fudging numbers bit as these are all transactions(probably)\n\nProblem continued - ETH is being swapped out of the pool and SAV3 is swapped in, not locked. That same ETH is paired with more SAV3 and made into LP and locked. So if you are keeping count 1 part ETH for 2 parts SAV3. What I believe this causes is a slight downward pressure on price as the pool is \u201cdiluted\u201d with extra SAV3.\n\nSolution -\n\nWe change the tax to be all ETH. This would allow swapping ETH for SAV3. This takes SAV3 out of the pool and adds ETH. This would add ETH to the pool giving an upward price pressure.\n\nIf a dev or admin could review the above and certify I am not an idiot I would appreciate it.
