The current rate at which liquidity Is locked is 4% per transfer. This is generating liquidity so quickly that the liquidity pool can and will eventually become so large that significant price movements will only be able to be performed by whales. Lowering the liquidity lock rate will minimize this concern.\n\n2.  The 4% liquidity lock rate combined with the 4% tax on transfers to reward LP holders creates an 8% total tax on buys/sells. This heavily disincentivizes new buyers to invest at higher price points, effectively killing upward price momentum.  Reducing the liquidity lock rate will reduce this barrier of entry and encourage new investors to flow into this project.", "choices": ["1%", "2%", "3%", "SAV3\u2019s gucci.
