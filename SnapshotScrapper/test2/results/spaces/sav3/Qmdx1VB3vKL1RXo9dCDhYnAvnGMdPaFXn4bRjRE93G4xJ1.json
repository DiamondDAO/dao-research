Brilliant minds could be discouraged by this. I want to change that mindset as  I truly believe in rewarding the Inventors, Ideators, and creators alike. People who don't just accept the status quo but are always striving to make this better for everyone, and make this world (a little )better along the way. \n\n[2] With this incentive, community engagement will increase highly and can be used as promotion/marketing for others to join.\n\nPeriod of this reward system: \nThe REWARD system will run for 2 months until 31 jan 2021*\n(*after this date, new voting will be needed to: continue/discontinue)\n\nGuidelines:\nTeam + community decides whether the proposal is a Gold, Silver or Bronze award. Rule: No1 reason is how much VALUE this proposal brings to the project/token. \n\nHigh value/High impact = GOLD (1ETH =10.000 sav3 (presale price))\nMedium value/Medium impact = SILVER (0.5 ETH =5.000 sav3 (presale price))\nMedium value/Low impact: BRONZE (0.25 ETH =2.500 sav3 (presale price))\n(presale price, to not make a difference between whitelisted and proposer, and the project being not even 1 week old and high price fluctuations)\n\nFor discussion about this proposal go to discourse: \nhttps://governance.sav3.org/t/reward-system-for-high-medium-value-proposals/59\n\nImportant note: this proposal will be implemented retroactively when active/approved.\n", "choices": ["Yes, great ideas should be rewarded", "No, bad idea", "No, need adjustment (share pls in discourse)"], "start": 1605956400, "end": 1606734000, "snapshot": "11302679", "state": "closed", "author": "0xf2fC4950fA6B5Cf030dD3dbbe00c36862CDcaa0f", "space": {"id": "sav3", "name": "SAV3"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZ9w2TsMrJFWeG3PXKEXQK8VXL1hx5gqpsLe8hosB6fGR", "voter": "0x3f1175c5B5C0507f7569a35871192B6f63347523", "created": 1606657719, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sav3"}}, {"id": "QmdFXjfbZ5SgMX2DxqvQTPfaqe1kaHgTr2ZsJCG3xvXy5m", "voter": "0x46c3f21CBFb0aAF0E2c05D27b7475150276dAc68", "created": 1606568236, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sav3"}}, {"id": "QmaKE4vXmUQLRAbHbGw6JgMeyPS3bVYmxmKp16jWLVhwZK", "voter": "0x36e7cCedD450473e5840c4EFc26Fb28124D2A9Db", "created": 1606324541, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sav3"}}, {"id": "QmYWZk4M6dENA5fRuaNSV5mLxzN6UpxvfMhTCu1C5fSAsR", "voter": "0x7F202a4b8Cdb2176cD64e55f3Db3cbF5c7d2cf6F", "created": 1606315631, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sav3"}}, {"id": "QmRiEEKzFAQWtTGkZKAJLgY1U926DTB4TXBe7fVAJopwQ8", "voter": "0x8783847b3c579Fd98287453bA77BFb672FEC4454", "created": 1606306584, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sav3"}}, {"id": "QmPf67KCHNDqrSXGBUQv2Lnuqd9dsLMJW4YtYkr9JrMaZK", "voter": "0x96F3e26Aa12395e26dfe8AA53385CB5E80c493FB", "created": 1606303088, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sav3"}}, {"id": "QmU9pSAkfQrRzkURo3dzjVQtTvT3MkkGDzDBZWqDM2Fsw5", "voter": "0x7223E76b2871A3c41202472fb2CEC92ad76eE767", "created": 1606301966, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sav3"}}, {"id": "QmQ9PDTnzsofpWnCvqvCHsQRSniGrCeBh2Ar1K8EmUDoCa", "voter": "0xDBB9d557191501fd2CAdF5a9FD80845f162d20dd", "created": 1606145334, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sav3"}}, {"id": "QmbffQtCdqXx5WYZwYMDprMpHPZJDzXNPb7ASsfEBFQRwH", "voter": "0xeDbAE069a2E6ba71882b629b9494De0aD3E57Edb", "created": 1606084830, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sav3"}}, {"id": "QmTjLEcwHqtnGUbeYNEZmK2i7HYYZu9z3LKVPGAxsL9N84", "voter": "0x97f4319bfEFd1394fC33E0721cBe7388C57Aa810", "created": 1606046423, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "sav3"}}]}
