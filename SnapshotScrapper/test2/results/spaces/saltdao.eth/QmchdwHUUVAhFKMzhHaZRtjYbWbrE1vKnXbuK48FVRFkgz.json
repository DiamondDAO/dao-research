{"id": "QmchdwHUUVAhFKMzhHaZRtjYbWbrE1vKnXbuK48FVRFkgz", "title": "Should we introduce a new token, $DRIP?", "body": "On April 20, 2021 a poll was created in the Governance channel of the SaltDAO Discord Server with the objective of gauging interest and support to update SaltDAO tokenomics. Of the three options which were presented, the prevailing one was to move forward with the introduction of a second token, $DRIP.\n\nIn the current tokenomics design, the $SALTY token functions in many ways. Though it is primarily a governance token, it also performs functions like providing access to Salt Seasons or being used to pay for Salt Season items with both of the latter functions resulting in the burning of $SALTY.\n\nThe objective of the updated tokenomics design is to focus $SALTY functionality on governance and to shift the rewards functions and deflationary mechanisms to a new token, $DRIP. That way $SALTY can better serve its function as a governance token and voting mechanism and will continue to be the vehicle through which value generated by the SaltDAO ecosystem, is captured. \n\nThe new token, $DRIP will be introduced to take over the auxiliary functions of $SALTY, which largely relate to exclusivity and rewards. At a high level, $DRIP is a deflationary token which can only be farmed by staking $SALTY LP tokens. $DRIP will provide access to exclusive drops called \"$DRIP Drops\", and in some cases can be used to purchase Salt & Satoshi items. Both of these functions will result in the burning of $DRIP which makes future participation in $DRIP Drops more exclusive.\n\nAdditional details on $DRIP and the tokenomics of SaltDAO can be found at https://www.notion.so/saltandsatoshi/2021-04-11-Tokenomics-Proposal-4caa04c9f3ae422587fec0e9f148cfbe.", "choices": ["Yes, introduce $DRIP", "No, do not introduce $DRIP"], "start": 1619564340, "end": 1620082740, "snapshot": "12322731", "state": "closed", "author": "0xd362db73b59A824558fFeBDFC83073F9E364dbc6", "space": {"id": "saltdao.eth", "name": "SaltDAO"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmabF7LQDi4QQBoxJMssdowvwmTmMREhQE9YCH1qy8NM8r", "voter": "0x7aa69b5EE49C4D3170e037960ca6c83F61241395", "created": 1620081785, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "saltdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZrWJvdJBg55zBiiy3g3xSD9ixdWGAL26b7F1ZGXsMco3", "voter": "0x81aA6141923Ea42fCAa763d9857418224d9b025a", "created": 1619908906, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "saltdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQg3jKe4z3FC8pgEzrkQ1a7aczwCbk7NA1Xn75rXDSNTS", "voter": "0xDA06606DD7d225f33F38527507653Ba259598090", "created": 1619779692, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "saltdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNc8CRt8roKD1rS5mUwV1vi9ZZQb4o4GN4AbkRjebMrnG", "voter": "0x015EdbDd1deDe3E011A694EcF48CA933661e0213", "created": 1619731417, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "saltdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP5UqPNhQzdT9tX8ABYrmArgnd9H83vL5233FDiJtMzAj", "voter": "0xAD02B6d3F43E22289C20F2843832F5E6C22fD472", "created": 1619676467, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "saltdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYBrg41JsPcFXa17Cv5xryR4M5dyFT63uJyMKeCesZutn", "voter": "0x9ECd3F09F4C6d9Cf04728fC9DE4feEd87DfA4683", "created": 1619620774, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "saltdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ1L5BiSAFtMTk5DMGzvBTNaNhJPFtQDoqDFzHvThHAcq", "voter": "0xe32395e1E93928cc3e17152E5e79A3A3e705CBC4", "created": 1619619136, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "saltdao.eth"}}]}
