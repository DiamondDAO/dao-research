Specifically, I have completed and presented research on governance, created accessibility for governance information on docs, and created docs for the onboarding process.\n\n**What role do you plan on playing in the community going forward?**\n\nGoing forward, I would like to take the lead on the governance project.\n\n**How much do you want to earn? What else do you foresee needing from the community for you to do your best work?**\n\nI would like to earn $500 weekly. In order to do my best work, I need active participation from the community on governance issues as well as honest feedback from community members about how they feel I am doing in my role.\n\n**What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\nIn my book, the tasks of the lead governance position can be broken down into three parts. First is facilitation. In order to create an authentic decentralized form of governance, there needs to be constant conversation and speculation of which the lead governance position can facilitate. The second part, is research. In order for a community to make an accurate decision, they need to be well informed of different governance options and to be presented with stimulating ideas. The final task is just general accessibility to governance information by keeping the community updated on what we have done so far (docs etc).\n\n**Under what criteria might it make sense for the community to reassess this payout allocation to you?**\n\nThe community should reassess payments to me if progress towards a decentralized form of governance is lost and if there is a lack of circulation of governance ideas focused on community betterment.\n\n", "choices": ["Approve the proposal", "Reject the proposal"], "start": 1632196800, "end": 1632286800, "snapshot": "13266426", "state": "closed", "author": "0xf7253A0E87E39d2cD6365919D4a3D56D431D0041", "space": {"id": "jbdao.eth", "name": "JuiceboxDAO"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmW5xdTW4HMyqshzheHB1tnNGDppMteZvrpP6VwnmSXBw3", "voter": "0x80F40C7F12884E52aF9ab24b0C5d474EB0926Eb2", "created": 1632285612, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jbdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYF3AbkCtpLrQMtqMdmQZLJQTfpos3dpnLWAvewpDS6KN", "voter": "0xe7879a2D05dBA966Fcca34EE9C3F99eEe7eDEFd1", "created": 1632266286, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jbdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNZwCg74ScT2JHxBwnjiZshW8HESqYd9YEDRGrjRnSKmx", "voter": "0xf7253A0E87E39d2cD6365919D4a3D56D431D0041", "created": 1632261182, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jbdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUofXLj6czmu8HoryDau5to9sQn3NUScwbStZUWkpGKca", "voter": "0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A", "created": 1632261166, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jbdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPiSUsbAuNDsruB4qVvRVA9HZQkwVzKae3mw6c8SfLrmt", "voter": "0x8916a35E050FA01338e708b19626CA76cfc74016", "created": 1632261076, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jbdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXfVqnn584mUBpvVY6Jtaw3SQBf27HLQkGRKnaRXN23fh", "voter": "0x6877be9E00d0bc5886c28419901E8cC98C1c2739", "created": 1632247520, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jbdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ26FvvB9irQKEzx9YUb6oYb64CBFJksF1WEaqjt3h9yh", "voter": "0xB82AdF9206FFA17B5BE784D94A8AC76606691C56", "created": 1632236711, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jbdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdMVhbAyhxAzTYMtAKkLu5Q9QtRXefeQuUMXMzU2koqM1", "voter": "0xb03F5438f9A243De5C3B830B7841EC315034cD5f", "created": 1632225183, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jbdao.eth"}}]}
