Let's **VOTE** for the number of mining pools!\n\nShardingDAO's Phase 1 single currency mining has ended while the Phase 2 liquidity mining is on going. Other than the two phases, ShardingDAO decided to add an additional **14 DAYS** of single currency mining, which includes a total mining reward of **30,000 SHD** (spent from Marketing Fund). \n\nThe types of mining pool is being voted on **[SHDIP-001]**. The final number of mining pools on Ethereum will also be determined by the majority of community users.\n\nCommunity voted **BUSD** for BSC mining pool. If this proposal is adopted, a **BUSD** single currency mining pool will be launched on BSC. Determination of mining pool's number on Ethereum requires users' voting. Please make your choice/s among the **17** options we're offering.\n \n**BE REMIND**: the total reward is fixed. In other words, the smaller the number of mining pools, the more rewards will be distributed to each one; while the more the number of mining pools, the greater the chance of your favorite mining pool going online.\n\n# Voting Rules\n- **SHD-ETH LP Token** (on Ethereum), is the vote token, also called \"**SHDVOTE**\";\n- Add liquidity to the SHD-ETH pool to get SHD-ETH LP Token; any user can participate in voting with the SHD-ETH LP Token voucher;\n- Voting conditions: **negative vote<=40%**, **participation rate>=20%**;\n- Voting will last for **5 DAYS**;\n- If the proposal is adopted, the ShardingDAO team will initiate a **Timelock** transaction to execute the proposal on **April 19th**, which will take effect within **24 HOURS**.\n\nWe would like you to know the **[SHDIP-002]** takes effect ONLY on the condition of the adoption of **[SHDIP-001]**; or **[SHDIP-002]** will FAIL. We will announce the results on the ShardingDAO official account. \n\nJoin us!
