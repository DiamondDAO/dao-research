The Ratio is 1:1.\n\nTherefore we are publishing [SHDIP-004], and the result of [SHDIP-003] will be invalid. Please vote for the new proposal!\n\n\n# Background\nSince Pancake V1 has stopped liquidity adding, the current ShardingDAO Mining Pool on the BSC chain's No.0 mining pool (SHD-BNB) is still using the V1 version of LP. For the sustainable and healthy development of the mining pool, it is necessary to add a new SHD-BNB LP mining pool that supports the Pancake V2 version.\n\n# Proposals\nAs a result, we've come up with **2 proposals**. Let us know which one do you like better.\n1. **[Don't Migrate]** Add SHD-BNB LP mining pool that supports Pancake V2 version while keeping the SHD-BNB LP mining pool of the Pancake V1 version.\n2. **[Migrate]** Add SHD-BNB LP mining pool that supports Pancake V2 version while migrating SHD-BNB LP in the V1 to SHD-BNB LP pool of the V2.\n\n# Descriptions\nWe recommend proposal 2 **[Migrate]** because of the followings:\n1. Seamless integration with Pancake V2. It makes redeeming LP a lot easier.\n2. Since the V1 version of the LP mining pool can no longer add liquidity, it may cause the slippage of the transaction to become higher, resulting in impermanent losses.\n3. Since the V1 version of the LP mining pool can no longer add liquidity, we may reduce the SHD profit or close it as the lockup of the mining pool decreases, which will affect the subsequent profit of the V1 version of LP.\n\n# Voting Rules\n* **Voting Token:** **SHDVOTE**\n* **the Way that SHDVOTE is Counted:** The number of **SHDVOTE** you can get is determined by the number of SHD-ETH LP staked in ShardingDAO Mining Phase 2 before the proposal is launched. The Ratio is 1:1.\n* **Voting conditions:** participation rate>=20%;\n* Voting will last for **3 DAYS**;\nIf the proposal is adopted, the ShardingDAO team will initiate a **Timelock** transaction to execute the proposal, which will take effect within **24 HOURS**.\n\n# How to get SHDVOTE (before this proposal publish)\nAdd liquidity to the [SHD-ETH pool](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0xbECE15ed02A078272a3044827E68D33ef2db8335) to get SHD-ETH LP Token;\nStake SHD-ETH LP Token in [ShardingDAO Mining Phase 2](https://app.shardingdao.com/farms);\nVote in ShardingDAO Scattershot.\n\nLook forward to your voting!!!\n\nShardingDAO Team\n---\nWelcome to follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShardingDAO), [Telegram](https://t.me/shardingdao), [Discord](https://discord.gg/umceUPWwKM), [Forum](https://forum.shardingdao.com/)", "choices": ["Don't Migrate", "Migrate"], "start": 1622001600, "end": 1622260800, "snapshot": "12507661", "state": "closed", "author": "0x75f6c7986B8B785E039036dEc0290c8f4dDA70CF", "space": {"id": "shardingdao.eth", "name": "ShardingDAO"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmaYbLkSd9AzzLwkvDwBj7Uixe2q1d5nct4qcRUiS58xLC", "voter": "0x054Ae00a0c264a28990DeCB8e0Ea597c7E7c71AB", "created": 1622192083, "choice": {"2": 1}, "space": {"id": "shardingdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNVY9GtawL3qRKGuAuKQNvPzkrU88uTzZiAdoWCzD36z5", "voter": "0x1231C75850bF52851736891A39790A82Bcc2e2C4", "created": 1622191874, "choice": {"2": 1}, "space": {"id": "shardingdao.eth"}}]}
