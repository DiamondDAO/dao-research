For the sustainable and healthy development of the mining pool, it is necessary to add a new SHD-BNB LP mining pool that supports the Pancake V2 version.\n\n# Proposals #\nAs a result, we've come up with **2 proposals**. Let us know which one do you like better. \n\n**1. [Don't Migrate]** Add SHD-BNB LP mining pool that supports Pancake V2 version while keeping the SHD-BNB LP mining pool of the Pancake V1 version.\n\n**2. [Migrate]** Add SHD-BNB LP mining pool that supports Pancake V2 version while migrating SHD-BNB LP in the V1 to SHD-BNB LP pool of the V2.\n\n# Descriptions #\nWe recommend **proposal 2** because of the followings:\n\n**1. Seamless integration with Pancake V2. It makes redeeming LP a lot easier.**\n**2. Since the V1 version of the LP mining pool can no longer add liquidity, it may cause the slippage of the transaction to become higher, resulting in impermanent losses.**\n**3. Since the V1 version of the LP mining pool can no longer add liquidity, we may reduce the SHD profit or close it as the lockup of the mining pool decreases, which will affect the subsequent profit of the V1 version of LP.**\n\n# Voting Rules #\n+ SHD-ETH LP Token (on Ethereum), is the vote token, also called \"SHDVOTE\";\n+ Add liquidity to the SHD-ETH pool to get SHD-ETH LP Token; any user can participate in voting with the SHD-ETH LP Token voucher;\n+ Voting conditions: participation rate>=20%;\n+ Voting will last for **3 DAYS**;\n+ If the proposal is adopted, the ShardingDAO team will initiate a Timelock transaction to execute the proposal, which will take effect within 24 HOURS.\n\nLook forward to your voting!!!\n\nShardingDAO Team\n\n\n---\nWelcome to follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShardingDAO), [Telegram](https://t.me/shardingdao), [Discord](https://discord.gg/umceUPWwKM), [Forum](https://forum.shardingdao.com/)", "choices": ["Don't Migrate", "Migrate"], "start": 1621598400, "end": 1621857600, "snapshot": "12477409", "state": "closed", "author": "0x75f6c7986B8B785E039036dEc0290c8f4dDA70CF", "space": {"id": "shardingdao.eth", "name": "ShardingDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
