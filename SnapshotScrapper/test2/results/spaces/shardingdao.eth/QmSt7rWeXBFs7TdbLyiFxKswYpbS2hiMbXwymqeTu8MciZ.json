We hope to know which type of token do our users like so that we will launch the certain one/s for limited-time welfare mining. The poll is simutanuously opened on **[SHDIP-002]**.\n\n# Background\n\nShardingDAO's Phase 1 single currency mining has ended while the Phase 2 liquidity mining is on going. Other than the two phases, ShardingDAO decided to add an additional **14 DAYS** of single currency mining, which includes a total mining reward of **30,000 SHD** (spent from Marketing Fund). Our users will decide the types of mining pools for this welfare mining.\n\nFrom April 8th to April 11th, we asked users about the types of single-coin mining pools they want to via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShardingDAO) and our [Forum](https://forum.shardingdao.com/). After the solicitation of opinions, we counted the number of nominations + likes, and finally decided the top 6 Ethereum currencies, namely: **TRIBE**, **RPL**, **UNI**, **LTC**, **DOT**, **DOGE**.\n\nCommunity voted **BUSD** for BSC mining pool. If this proposal is adopted, a **BUSD** single currency mining pool will be launched on BSC.\n \nThe above 6 pools and the exist 11 pools (except ETH, BNB, or BUSD; users who hold ETH and BNB can participate in the Phase 2 LP liquidity mining) will enter the final round of voting. The exist 11 mining pools include **WBTC**, **USDT**, **B20**, **MEME**, **MUSE**, **RARI**, **WHALE**, **NFTX**, **MANA**, **SAND**, and **ENJ**.\n\n# Voting Rules\n\nVoting options include a total of **17 mining pools** + **a \"Not listed\"** option. You're able to make multiple choices. The top **X** currencies will be launched this time-limited welfare mining pool. The number of **X** will be determined by the voting results of the **[SHDIP-002]** proposal.\n\n- **SHD-ETH LP Token** (on Ethereum), is the vote token, also called \"**SHDVOTE**\";\n- Add liquidity to the SHD-ETH pool to get SHD-ETH LP Token; any user can participate in voting with the SHD-ETH LP Token voucher;\n- Voting conditions: **negative vote<=40%**, **participation rate>=20%**;\n- Voting will last for **5 DAYS**;\n- If the proposal is adopted, the ShardingDAO team will initiate a **Timelock** transaction to execute the proposal on **April 19th**, which will take effect within **24 HOURS**.\n\nThe ShardingDAO voting governance platform allows users allocate their voting vouchers proportionally. Tickets will be distributed according to the weight assigned to each Token. \n\nThis vote is the FIRST implementation of ShardingDAO community governance. In the future, we will conduct the election of the governance committee with the development of the ShardingDAO community. The community members will then jointly determine the change and development direction of ShardingDAO.\n\nSo, to make the first baby step forward, **VOTE** for your favorite pools!", "choices": ["WBTC", "USDT", "B20", "MEME", "MUSE", "RARI", "WHALE", "NFTX", "MANA", "SAND", "ENJ", "LTC", "DOT", "UNI", "DOGE", "TRIBE", "RPL", "Not Listed"], "start": 1618309800, "end": 1618741800, "snapshot": "12231043", "state": "closed", "author": "0x75f6c7986B8B785E039036dEc0290c8f4dDA70CF", "space": {"id": "shardingdao.eth", "name": "ShardingDAO"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUCpJSSGEfw58QTedVs6qY2ibzNNBHJuMyyq4Pn2wd9wH", "voter": "0xac4e7097bA88a534dD99e06C7382fC5D087A8160", "created": 1618408711, "choice": {"1": 2, "15": 1}, "space": {"id": "shardingdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWvyojYDtxwzdyXyYB3JpSAid8WbZspBPwo5M1hnSa2YS", "voter": "0xcfdf275510809d14FdE806167f98B8Dfe95216A1", "created": 1618408590, "choice": {"1": 1, "15": 1}, "space": {"id": "shardingdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVBNWDCcvVyfa2Uhxk3KsgttKi1QvVJuJUtCY28qiQq3a", "voter": "0x95F64eCd5426e439c177846ac8Aadb1AC7aAE027", "created": 1618388980, "choice": {"1": 1}, "space": {"id": "shardingdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeY9aqczjcxm9PuYRAwWZ8Bbz3UfCa5mk32yNGyzjaKHW", "voter": "0xbF15754dC61f5e552a5C5a51E6b571D567798650", "created": 1618357646, "choice": {"7": 1, "8": 1}, "space": {"id": "shardingdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVq11iravjPYvQ2wHeGMU8eUuCJUsHEwLhTxgV5sQuQHH", "voter": "0x0d307D9C8B6D4aaD162A662E4bbFbA9Ea96A5F81", "created": 1618322304, "choice": {"3": 1}, "space": {"id": "shardingdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPjPx5EmEiwywCBghGs5Grg3Jj57gVpiUt4GrEt7Z894C", "voter": "0x72dA0B8A1B932C8a2cC9dCF8C28642290220aeC4", "created": 1618320654, "choice": {"13": 1}, "space": {"id": "shardingdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZZL5hFYB9XW76GyN8aPHRnnm3b5JYVQocpTauurzUBCS", "voter": "0x0A5aBC4eEF196994abb9cd34fa8FE9229Ce53e4f", "created": 1618319640, "choice": {"1": 1}, "space": {"id": "shardingdao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSiR5BxGRGosbkqJEEzUeYgDQwCZ6zc1wkcy5ykLcXSvd", "voter": "0x759dE6B9806A5F695B8FE92f58a6771fB5DB52C6", "created": 1618317595, "choice": {"6": 1}, "space": {"id": "shardingdao.eth"}}]}
