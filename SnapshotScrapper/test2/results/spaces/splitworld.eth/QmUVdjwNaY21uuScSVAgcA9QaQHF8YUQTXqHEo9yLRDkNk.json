If the proposal is accepted, these steps will be taken:\n\n1) Freezing SPLT trading by closing SPLT/ETH liquidity pool on Uniswap (i.e., stop providing liquidity with the SplitWorld vault).\n\n2) Merging the communities of both projects including reorganization of the discord servers.\n\n3) Unifying LoK revenue share programs: moving from 75/20/5 (Community/Vault/Overseers) split to 80/20 (Community/Vault) by removing shares for Overseers. xDAI will be used for Payout until the release of the NFG token.\n\n4) Working on finalizing the tokenomics of the NFG token together. This will be done openly: All current SPLT (and BRGR) holder will be included in the process and will be encouraged to provide input. \n\nUntil the release of the NFG token (i.e., until the NFG tokens are airdropped to the current SPLT and BRGR holder) all SPLT holders have the chance to 'cash out' by selling their SPLT to Ace for a fixed price of 0.00012 ETH/SPLT (120% of initial price).
