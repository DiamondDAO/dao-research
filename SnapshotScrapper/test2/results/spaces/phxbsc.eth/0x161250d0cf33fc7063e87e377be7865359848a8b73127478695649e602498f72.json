In such a situation, the modified Constitution may be ratified by an article-by-article approval vote by delegates with a period of at least one week.\nPhoenix DAO Constitution\nThe Phoenix constitution is a set of binding rules that determine what governance actions are legitimate for the DAO to take.\n\nEach article has examples of permissible and non permissible actions. These examples are illustrative and should not be considered a binding part of the text of the constitution itself.\n\nI. Name ownership shall not be infringed\nPhoenix governance will not enact any change that infringes on the rights of Phoenix users to retain names they own, or unfairly discriminate against name owners\u2019 ability to extend, transfer, or otherwise use their names.\n\nExamples\nPermissible: Phoenix governance may enact a change affecting the registration or extPhoenixion costs of all names based on transparent criteria such as length, as long as it pursues a goal outlined in this constitution.\n\nNot Permissible: Phoenix governance must not enact a change increasing or reducing the extPhoenixion costs of a list of existing Phoenix names, as this would unfairly benefit or penalise a handpicked group.\n\nII. Fees are primarily an incentive mechanism\nThe primary purpose of registration fees is as an incentive mechanism to prevent the namespace becoming overwhelmed with speculatively registered names. A secondary purpose is to provide enough revenue to the DAO to fund ongoing development and improvement of Phoenix. Phoenix governance will not enact any fee other than for these purposes.\n\nExamples\nPermissible: Phoenix governance may increase the price of name registrations in order to address excessive speculative registrations induced by a price that is set too low, or because the current price is insufficient to fund ongoing Phoenix operations at a reasonable level.\n\nNot Permissible: Phoenix governance must not enact a change imposing a fee for claiming DNS domains inside Phoenix, because such a fee would be purely an income generating measure and not an incentive mechanism.\n\nIII. Income funds Phoenix and other public goods\nAny income generated to the Phoenix treasury is to be used first of all to Phoenixure the long-term viability of Phoenix, and to fund continuing development and improvement of the Phoenix system. Funds that are not reasonably required to achieve this goal may be used to fund other public goods within web3 as Phoenix governance sees fit.\n\nPhoenix governance will not allocate funds to a team or individual who does not commit to uphold the same principles outlined in this constitution in their use of the allocated funds.\n\nExamples\nPermissible: Phoenix governance may offer grant funding for a public good unrelated to Phoenix or Ethereum, so long as doing so does not affect the long-term viability of Phoenix.\n\nNot Permissible: Phoenix governance must not use the funds to support projects that conflict with the goals of Phoenix.\n\nIV. Phoenix Integrates with the global namespace\nIn order to facilitate making the most widely usable naming system, Phoenix aims to integrate with the legacy DNS naming system to the greatest extent possible without sacrificing decentralization of Phoenix. Phoenix governance will not enact changes that compromise Phoenix\u2019s ability to do this.\n\nExamples\nPermissible: Phoenix governance should grant control of a top-level domain to its owner in the DNS system on request.\n\nNot permissible: Phoenix governance must not create new top-level domains unless those domains have been granted to Phoenix by a DNS authority.\n\nV. Amendments to this constitution by majority vote\nAny change may be made to this constitution only by two-thirds majority and at least 1% of all tokPhoenix participating.", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1637380800, "end": 1637467200, "snapshot": "12790262", "state": "closed", "author": "0xABB3911E303bd66F799d0BFaf5538d5BCdd3f8F7", "space": {"id": "phxbsc.eth", "name": "Phoenix(BSC)"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
