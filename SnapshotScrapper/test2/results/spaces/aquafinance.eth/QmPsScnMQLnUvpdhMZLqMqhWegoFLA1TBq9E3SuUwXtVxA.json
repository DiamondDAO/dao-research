Recently, our team has been in contact with Apeswap and their team has shown interest in our project and have recommend the Aqua Finance team to join the Apeswap BUIDL program. Through the BUIDL program, not only will Aqua Finance tokens will be eligible to join the apeswap partners and potentially be given liquidity mining program through staking to earn $banana, but also provide the team with a wider array of partners to co-op with.\n\nProposal:\nIn order for the team to join the Apeswap BUIDL program, we have to first move at least 75% of total liquidity of CEA and wAFI from Pancakeswap Liquidity Pool (PCS-LP) to Apeswap Liquidity Pool (Ape-LP) and also use APE-LP as the primary pool for emission (75% of total CEA emission per block). To do so, we have to make some big changes to the PCS-LP by lowering the multiplier on PCS-LP and add the APE-LP pool with higher multiplier. The outcome changes will be as follow:\n\n\u2022 Add new CEA-BNB Ape-LP with 50x Multiplier\n\u2022 Add new CEA-BUSD Ape-LP with 35x Multiplier\n\u2022 Add new wAFI-BNB Ape-LP with 15x Multiplier\n\u2022 Add new wAFI-BUSD Ape-LP with 10x Multiplier\n\u2022 Change CEA-BNB PCS-LP multiplier from 50x -> 10x\n\u2022 Change CEA-BUSD PCS-LP multiplier from 35x -> 5x\n\u2022 Change wAFI-BNB PCS-LP multiplier from 15x -> 5x\n\u2022 Change wAFI-BUSD PCS-LP multiplier from 10x -> 5x\n\nFrom these changes, there will be at least 75% of total liquidity pool emission towards Ape-LP which will follow the condition for Aqua Finance to join Apeswap BUIDL Program.\n\nVoting Procedure:\nWe propose the community to vote FOR, and all qualified voters are AFI holders / wAFI holders\n\nOptions to vote:\nA: Yes, change and add the new Ape-LP\nB: No, keep the old PCS-LP\n\nImplementation:\nOnce the voting has completed, the new liquidity pool will be added as soon as possible.", "choices": ["Yes, change and add new Ape-LP", "B: No, keep old PCS-LP"], "start": 1630504800, "end": 1630677600, "snapshot": "10451441", "state": "closed", "author": "0x967E0399495c96E656F02404697c94b0C4679eaA", "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth", "name": "Aqua Finance"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRsKGShrF6mYGYQL77k5jvffghHvFjXfis1c7J8PqZK3M", "voter": "0x694B9de211EBF245c5fbdDdC9a27A1c732C059FF", "created": 1630666183, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSQTNeh5kGCFjP3vq5mURUq1pnprGUzR39xx8gRHuAmwM", "voter": "0x1A30254019b2dfBC7DD54B651458482B9451e821", "created": 1630641410, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYxAmuuYJoLfk2ceGhR6udS8niytxtMZ5rJirjgioahP1", "voter": "0xb41EDc60b0D6886C75A526C7A10dd68db7aa59D3", "created": 1630563261, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUWdqSiLeRDimaqM5dPrEBrhJtUFVLGBEb94tWCqLbPar", "voter": "0x3Ba6cce74a39DfE380AaECA794B4bECE34F59795", "created": 1630560980, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme3SsXEHpKDn3qK19izx4x4CtnzWqFwhYvb5BniknFpb1", "voter": "0xb72B159AFFB75Cb092EFe7AF8F178566EFDD225c", "created": 1630560029, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUZTZcj2h36Ptfe9KZezHzHPie5qCJfVB2r45XLFtERJA", "voter": "0x2EB30Ff9b62CBF482D62a125AB5bd68B720c43E7", "created": 1630560013, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbKNooxebK7Zv9Lihrnx3VwQCP29Dv4Nu8kSUZBs7Pt9y", "voter": "0xABd81838202ad94bdBEc1590907a74c32bDd393E", "created": 1630559991, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}]}
