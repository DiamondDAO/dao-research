{"id": "Qmb2MPSizgkv9P413od2Q7fSThdAAN9xy9wyLj6MagXs7i", "title": "Change Flappy Seal Game Architecture", "body": "Motivation :\nThe play-to-earn model is a hot topic around town which makes many developers want to come in and try to attract as much audience as possible. To create a more healthy environment for game players, the platform must have a sustainable business model that helps generate income for both the players and the platform. This means there must be a healthy correlation between the gas fees used to play the games, the reward must be sufficient enough for the players to profit from, and there must be minimal loopholes possible to prevent any possible hacks.\n\nProposal : \nWe would like to propose a complete change to our reward system for Aquarium Land which we at first intend to collect 100 AFI as a payment fee per \"Pearl\" that is use to play one game and reward through a gacha-like experience which has rewards going up to 60x of initial payment while also having 15% chance of losing money from the gacha.\n\nWhat we propose is as follow:\n\u2022 There will be no more \"Pearl\" in-game currency, each game will cost 10,000 AFI as initial entry and players can play up to 10,000 games per entry. (1 game = 1 AFI)\n\u2022 Cancelling the gacha-like reward system and reward players with 1 AFI per 1 game point (for example, Flappy Seal will reward 30 AFI if you receive 30 points in the game) with a maximum of 100 AFI per game\n\u2022 Players can play up to 30 games per day, to the maximum of 10,000 games per entry\n\u2022 Players can only claim AFI rewards once per day when they have collected 1,000 AFI in-game. Collecting less than 1,000 AFI and they cannot claim anything at all, collecting more than 1,000 AFI and they will not receive any more than 1,000 AFI from the game run\n\u2022 When collecting the reward, the reward is subjected to 10% tax due to AFI tokenomics \n\nFrom these changes, the platform and AFI holders will benefit from\n\u2022 Less risk from gacha probabilities\n\u2022 Receiving tax from every transaction, including receiving game rewards and selling rewards\n\u2022 Very minimal gas usage, once when paying for entry cost and once when receiving reward\n\u2022 Open up possibilities for scholarship programs where AFI holders open up games for other players to play on their behalf and share benefits.\n\nFor the reward pools that will be used to payout as reward for players will come from\n\u2022 Initial payment of 10,000 AFI (subjected to tax 10%)\n\u2022 As more players come in, the payments will add up as another AFI wallet holder, thus also gaining from 3% tax to holder from every transaction, which will ultimately be given back to game players\n\u2022 In-store shop that implements AFI as payments\n\u2022 Booster payments from dev wallet (when the number of AFI in the wallet falls under certain threshold)\n\nVoting Procedure : \nWe propose the community to vote FOR, and all qualified voters are AFI holders / wAFI holders\n\n\u2022 Voting closes on August 6, 2021 9:00 UTC +7\n\nOptions to vote:\nA: Yes, change the payment and reward system\nB: No, keep the old payment and reward system\n\nImplementation:\nOnce the voting has completed, it will be reflected when the game is launched.", "choices": ["Accept", "Decline"], "start": 1628085600, "end": 1628258400, "snapshot": "9742001", "state": "closed", "author": "0x967E0399495c96E656F02404697c94b0C4679eaA", "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth", "name": "Aqua Finance"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdDMBW52KHVRvu3x8H4MBhBpJvTULbyuxepSVj1kp8nZX", "voter": "0x6EfBe0C1DE81C8D7fcBC78e62a70232B70F1c350", "created": 1628253542, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdNHESC9th9DDL6TCUGRZWDZWt894q2ZNqComL1z9GoY3", "voter": "0x1742cb790B87cE31B1012536999a6a5137Af04C0", "created": 1628240637, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNfCJnvXLVaL3qUqFLsxdxAuVyfbqF9kKN2Haehrc3pEd", "voter": "0x3a60589e9605978aCc9049BcBA23D0ccEe3677Ea", "created": 1628227037, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmba1nM99x2AjvUc6EEBLZyWxobYXkd4YwFXDTGVPvX9Ab", "voter": "0xb72B159AFFB75Cb092EFe7AF8F178566EFDD225c", "created": 1628192150, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmamHcyDHVTGnBWdi8GPLqwm7bJJCskJQXpw3khESjTwjb", "voter": "0x5B900947916ac64d580264940ba8E2213676a8BC", "created": 1628142042, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeNKz42ZLcZRVp6XgKsATpfzPYes5sqZmhR6Uggq44KPa", "voter": "0xf2741F375a568251fa19FD40F9bde8dd7A8e0106", "created": 1628137073, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYyUyMqHobAYydDbo9ADuV5ryD8NVjnUAW8FtqjmkSe3N", "voter": "0x572ddb87868A57F847109AD511D9786874165302", "created": 1628135646, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZBcwMFuvUichjXhMs4xrtGYwLxaMwqZgqGEZY1mC8u4U", "voter": "0xb75CB7D96e3A1e5219fde5B095009523998a7668", "created": 1628133108, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUMHNrLQjKR9scYhoixuPTisv9qfkNfL4kX7M1L5GYn77", "voter": "0x8A0e943c6674D826d187DCea36E4F072e7b8bc82", "created": 1628132093, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS1NL6xzXswS8kaNHgjRVqxh5fZtVSmGMPNvku2XuSAFu", "voter": "0x27f25D2d683C68634573abb2fDc530b301bc1E60", "created": 1628122998, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmcnv6Mk4hhrMZUqLyRT2tLEeNUoHvcDEBB6X6fnR4pXqe", "voter": "0x36498dae269c2EeC2AeF350E5699e6B9dbC095D4", "created": 1628088388, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTZVejtMTxuZHUquy5wzUNMZ7oQY4JfSyRJVW2Dukok4D", "voter": "0x1A30254019b2dfBC7DD54B651458482B9451e821", "created": 1628088204, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNWSiYafDbgnCnieQvkEQxn7ZrJDs39kyYJ1EiXmWNTT3", "voter": "0x5b4DfEF6d20352e5Ce4E7beD52092Bd2bD5ef4c4", "created": 1628087877, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ6XseBtgxY1ybLpvyKinqVAmgJXdMEnugLtDU3zeVbMj", "voter": "0x4bc422192b4e6e1435d2BE075CD810E5CE827996", "created": 1628086017, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR924fLmGn8LcynDGPR1TJNK4trhHuT8u6Fi4k8dwA9uA", "voter": "0x2EB30Ff9b62CBF482D62a125AB5bd68B720c43E7", "created": 1628085970, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbG3fCBKy3GVVdc1og3LwuxdLAiQyKm2N4y3civvocptb", "voter": "0xABd81838202ad94bdBEc1590907a74c32bDd393E", "created": 1628085929, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}]}
