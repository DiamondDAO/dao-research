Our initial plan to provide the one year emission was to get the supply out in the market as quick as possible as we expect the burns in the game to be sufficient enough to control the supply of the market to not overflow as much. However, as we are approaching the launch of our game, the supply of CEA is overflowing the market and the price of CEA could not keep up with the burns we are using from the development's team warchest.\n\nProposal:\nWe would like to propose a change in the emission rate of CEA from initially planned to be emitted out all of its liquidity pool supply within one year to be emitted out all of its liquidity pool supply within three years. As we are approaching our end of our first month of emission (12% of total supply emitted) on August 24th, 2021, we propose to change the next month's emission rate as well as all of the months follow to be emitted at a lower rate to follow our 3-year emission plan as follow:\n\n\u2022 Month 1 : 12% of total supply (emission ends on August 23rd, 2021)\n\u2022 Month 2-6 : 16% of total supply (% separated equally each month : 3.2% per month)\n\u2022 Month 7-12 : 14% of total supply (% separated equally each month : 2.3% per month)\n\u2022 Month 13-18 : 12% of total supply (% separated equally each month : 2% per month)\n\u2022 Month 19-24 : 10% of total supply (% separated equally each month : 1.66% per month)\n\u2022 Month 25-30 : 8% of total supply (% separated equally each month : 1.33% per month)\n\u2022 Month 31-36 : 6% of total Supply (% separated equally each month : 1% per month)\n\nFrom these changes, it will not only slow down the % emission each month causing the supply to overflow, but it will also help maintain the price of CEA to not be too low which as a result causes lower incentives for liquidity providers as well.\n\nVoting Procedure : \nWe propose the community to vote FOR, and all qualified voters are AFI holders / wAFI holders \n\nOptions to vote:\nA: Yes, change the emission rate, using the proposed % emission\nB: Yes, change the emission rate, but make a proposal again on % emission\nC: No, keep the old emission rate\n\nImplementation:\nOnce the voting has completed, the new emission rate will be reflected on August 24th, 2021", "choices": ["A.", "B.", "C."], "start": 1628690400, "end": 1628863200, "snapshot": "9930593", "state": "closed", "author": "0x967E0399495c96E656F02404697c94b0C4679eaA", "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth", "name": "Aqua Finance"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQsyDDcPitwk7KtLsUNZRawUJenCE1a2bgaVj9ArWXjEQ", "voter": "0x3Ba6cce74a39DfE380AaECA794B4bECE34F59795", "created": 1628836990, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYw6YDcQHfqLxNSpj9CZnpaXhPJxqM7V56QcqKKZoRhxv", "voter": "0x1f244e1c30C6061eE184F6B41CcD187f6fec764f", "created": 1628829927, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSVF8KN5xGQMzSLXmLKLvUZsWRgkc97oxbGMKYxhivaBC", "voter": "0x6EfBe0C1DE81C8D7fcBC78e62a70232B70F1c350", "created": 1628777755, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSFLtgETeYA1bTxCEd2Gn8pjsRzfUJTdrWZm4cQkcFDZX", "voter": "0xc4DA6319585Ff59912013338108ca895e48Ac733", "created": 1628773018, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVLmAhcmvJpA73vzWehAaVfvQC7voQfpDXw15zBQkJJkF", "voter": "0x572ddb87868A57F847109AD511D9786874165302", "created": 1628760157, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXCuKKVVRdZz6cTagDe1s3fCu4i34fKGbzDCL9caY3jAs", "voter": "0x36498dae269c2EeC2AeF350E5699e6B9dbC095D4", "created": 1628750391, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV7o5MyAJQkUhhFaocTyBT3tidV9xDTveiVGa37fYM4SP", "voter": "0x1A30254019b2dfBC7DD54B651458482B9451e821", "created": 1628745145, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXKUxVGV6BemUzE7dFGg9z3UgFjdD3uWpg1oJiKt3bLMR", "voter": "0x2EB30Ff9b62CBF482D62a125AB5bd68B720c43E7", "created": 1628693185, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc9vvr58PNPoA3jq4evpBDrjkMKPLAxCyY9LTYCxEN9XU", "voter": "0xABd81838202ad94bdBEc1590907a74c32bDd393E", "created": 1628693160, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "aquafinance.eth"}}]}
