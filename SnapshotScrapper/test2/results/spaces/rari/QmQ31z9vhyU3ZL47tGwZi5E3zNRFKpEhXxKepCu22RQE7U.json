USDC and DAI pools have earned decent yields, however they would benefit if new yield sources were generated.\n\n## Abstract\n\nNew Fuse pools face a chicken-and-egg problem where users want to lend USDC or DAI into new pools only when there's already yield (and therefore borrow demand) available. And users want to deposit collateral and borrow USDC or DAI only if those stablecoins are already available to borrow in the pool. Using the yield aggregator to deposit these stables will enable kickstart activity in these pools.\n\n## Motivation\n\nKickstarting activity in new Fuse pools has obviously beneficial short-term outcomes for Fuse pool users and Rari Capital. It also has beneficial medium and long-term outcomes for the USDC and DAI pools - as this new activity bootstrapped in turn generates yield that will be exclusively available to them and the Fuse pools, which could potentially be in excess of the yield that was otherwise being earned.\n\nPicking only pools less than 3 months old with low TVL ensures that the pools selected deserve this proactive deposit.", "choices": ["Allow proactive deposits", "Do not allow"], "start": 1624300200, "end": 1624473000, "snapshot": "12679417", "state": "closed", "author": "0x552C35f51A52fa1bF1CA481A9a57D464474248D2", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSVX62noYBcxmoA8JwxgrWMjpTYSuhvbChiMnrpzfmNPg", "voter": "0x67CBD1aEe9576C14049E720bb35Bc18b3386322D", "created": 1624451482, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmVTY51ckDtKMJsbWJvmVfMfFSK7BvtkJ3HDgSugrQsFuW", "voter": "0x1425C88ce0780E5bcE5f405333C81f9336dC52eA", "created": 1624427838, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qmdnngd87yVD15hYNABxJms69WEKKV1u6fKAA19UPUbLit", "voter": "0x128e5625e15FdBA91d6CcB1AbDFdC62b5d152b4f", "created": 1624412029, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQNJ88pPTDeGouyPBd7LEwtWb8dB3adQxR9mdo1mVWSB1", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1624407816, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmWx7YXtqPfgQ68LPsQ2HKotgQJ2FDKtV5qPBs3ApAn9kn", "voter": "0xb7Ef6B04858B967f65Dc595Ec70Ee9E3133963E7", "created": 1624407010, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmPs6YwB8f42v2gT1VLfpfVENAuhiRCCy9kUGgbk8Hcz7L", "voter": "0xfE99Cb7011E55F1dD8C376f9134e24EF8a10B14d", "created": 1624403759, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qmc7acU2c17Q7oUZ1485E4KRCHEhLnTZxvpPcQMpyDD5Sj", "voter": "0x8d07D225a769b7Af3A923481E1FdF49180e6A265", "created": 1624398588, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmXzDah2UHdi6TFqFci3Q9LuLxZzVZ7i2HQ9f8PSkpCRtF", "voter": "0x1c6F4dfc666da461a42e9b5D890C1d1ec5c6Ba16", "created": 1624346275, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmUKDyh1Z9jBycA6W9UYTF1piqgdsTz69uvnHQoyeC6LCZ", "voter": "0x227FD2fD881Cc6c99DFCcc0FB40f2B1dc2f3F36E", "created": 1624341874, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmRaSMmFSiUEV9Bw1ehcu6cSWA8jEu6ZS4D43aZNLXGkaC", "voter": "0x32B9f064cC3c219a61d875e26565cDCe5859E0e9", "created": 1624341083, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmWbr5UdBUE6DcWdH5yZjrUX5muws3bpnnyAEfxXwgfAw3", "voter": "0xfA88c88F68fc7A66CcD512a34F7686FDeD60CAF4", "created": 1624302597, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
