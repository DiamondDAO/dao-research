I've worked in the customer support field for many years for a wide range of companies, so I know how to handle stressful situations while guiding the customer into a satisfactory solution. I think this treat could be helpful for a role such as a forum MOD, and even though I'm not a dev, I love learning and talking to friends about the intricacies of code, the innovation of different assets and protocols, and how the markets work.\n\nRegarding the Translation offering, I have previously worked as a legal/technical translator for CaixaBank, one of the largest banks in Spain. My duties were, among others, to translate legal documentation and mediate between payment processors with chargeback claims.\n\nWorth to mention, you can see a brief example of the work I do as a Translator. I contributed to the UI translation of the website, https://www.xrptipbot.com/.\n\nTo wrap things up, here's a briefing of my application:\n\nQualities:\n\nCustomer support, handling stress situations and answering to complicated questions is my day to day.\nLanguage: Native Spanish, English advanced, German basic, Italian Basic.\nMedium understanding across different digital assets and the protocols behind.\nEmpathic, patient, people\u2019s person.\nTasks:\n\nOnboarding Spanish DeFi users across different channels (Twitter, Discord, Chat groups, Forums etc.).\nModeration of the Spanish community in Discord (Chat Etiquette, resolution of questions, guidance to relevant information, basic technical explanations.)\nComplete translation of UI for https://rari.capital/\nConditions for MOD:\n\nTrial period: 1 month.\nWorking hours: 40h / Week.\nSalary: 1500 USDC or RGT equivalent per month.\nDuration: Ideally 6 months to a Year.\nConditions for UI Translation:\n\nOne-Time Translation.\nOpen end, estimated completion two weeks.\n500 USDC or RGT equivalent.\nOptionally to be a recursive task, maintenance and updates.\nPretty much, that is, I am really looking forward to positive feedback and hopefully the beginning of my journey with Rari's Team!", "choices": ["For: MOD 1 Month trial", "For: Translation UI + Docs", "For: Both MOD + Translation", "Against: MOD", "Against: Translation", "Against: Both MOD + Translation", "Modification needed"], "start": 1626368400, "end": 1626541200, "snapshot": "12832436", "state": "closed", "author": "0x049698295d31DE54f94817D7FFd2f8A6BA1c2E58", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQPL7QMyjDnTZN799anqs8YYVbgtKUpZfLCYcC2kRmDZH", "voter": "0x532f2be5392C5094DD89893c20AeEa3B9a3F2DB6", "created": 1626509722, "choice": [7], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmYGMBur9xUiYBTujEJCBHRfJdweqZy8J6eUSjLza5zyhB", "voter": "0x32B9f064cC3c219a61d875e26565cDCe5859E0e9", "created": 1626509691, "choice": [6, 7], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmUNn4zGRYomwgXgEStKdYKixJapVgbwB3RsL34GUJepyn", "voter": "0xf9c18F2D1EA93e9A36507F238CFFc6f0Ad7D6eb3", "created": 1626507303, "choice": [6], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmZxX9B3QyazxPYhmn141WphXFqRu1E8REeJ48b7uvQHRZ", "voter": "0xEefD4ec15437568210e77181A3f61c3201f8554E", "created": 1626507279, "choice": [6], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQ66vKmA6JWh8iRwJ2YH2c15S2hBMPzT3K8xWekYysKh4", "voter": "0xBD1f7d88C76A86C60d41bDDD4819fAe404e7151E", "created": 1626485813, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmVpY3D6KLG3dgBpR7PWHo4YSpdFHM2Wnv5dnkfNPGLXFm", "voter": "0x968a0e5603c5D4dbF24cbd7df562921d158aD19C", "created": 1626483023, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmYPGhJR3meJybLQagH8FytG1pg8sBFqej22WFz2DMjSCz", "voter": "0x80251d6316677800A9b4e7fF02c164e01CB36aAa", "created": 1626479021, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmRVARNji4aCa4CDs3GyyBxo12iyPtbA6ndftkucMU51g3", "voter": "0xDFE7ad3E0cc6fb0798e66C67C72927C49fc42478", "created": 1626470982, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmVKRYwkvXdbkhFbJQqGSayUFZa5JnVtHgeF7n9BavMytC", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1626454673, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
