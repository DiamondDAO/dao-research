{"id": "QmPQ18PqYh28hEaFgYk3fmBWGaLfPPYfAWGytCHhhbMwhm", "title": "Concept Proposal: Create a grant to finish Fuse contract documentation", "body": "## Summary:  \n\n### Background \nAlthough there is extensive documentation on how to interact with fuse pools/comptrollers, there is little on the fuse pool lens and safe liquidator. I spent a long time reading through ABI JSON viewers and calling all the functions to fully understand what values returned would suit my projects best. I'm sure more important developers, especially ones working for other protocols, would benefit greatly from clear documentation.\n\n### Abstract \nCreating a grant to solve this would allow for the community to collaborate on who tackles the issue. The financial incentive absolutely needs to exist first, in order for us to have an engaging conversation on this ~~somewhat~~ boring, yet essential subject that is **documentation**.  \n\n### Motivation \nAt first the data structures returned from the fuse contracts are very confusing, but when laid out clearly, make perfect sense. Having documentation for the liquidator, and more importantly fuse pool lens, can save _hours_ from people building with Rari. This is especially true for those unfamiliar with the ecosystem such as developers from other protocols. An added benefit to this faster building, is fewer miscommunications.  This is why detailed, yet clear documentation is an incredibly important part of any DAO and cannot go overlooked. I intend on applying for this grant if it's approved, but I hope to have some competition so we can drive the bar even higher!\n\n[->This<-](https://github.com/jbenus/rari-docs-proposal/blob/main/README.md) mockup I made shows how the docs should be in accordance with the appearance of the [current](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/docs/tree/main/src/fuse#redeem) ones. \n\n### Payment\nThe payment should be between``$200-$500``in USDC or RGT. I think anyone applying for this grant should propose a fee in this range and tokens (or leave it to the DAO to decide _;)_ ).", "choices": ["For- create grant", "Against- don't create grant"], "start": 1624118400, "end": 1624291200, "snapshot": "12661477", "state": "closed", "author": "0x29bee0B61306DB9630834EeAC098c1635124A3F1", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYSZHVSnvziLT36Vr9ArgYz3SoHojADVhefEVmcDfRHL1", "voter": "0x32B9f064cC3c219a61d875e26565cDCe5859E0e9", "created": 1624257890, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQMuifFT4smiP4vGsJubENebgf3XfmKjAW51hDDxZuAsb", "voter": "0x58C6cD2b53d41d06bfB7D33624D2835C011E61BE", "created": 1624250776, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmbVs3EVjYW5eg2KzFHbjh8AxwKHaEwkNMw7bJjC3MtisZ", "voter": "0xC71deD6f0E5660DFe79C849058Afd9BE7a3c85b8", "created": 1624240034, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQWHHe6G2KJnCoCiUMYY43pD2Cn2YDFhruNLC3Kb3YwkX", "voter": "0x29bee0B61306DB9630834EeAC098c1635124A3F1", "created": 1624225435, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmXLpj8kpH2cYtttjc3n25Jxa81Y36mDK2yeUD5AhUSgCg", "voter": "0x2049B0E6f4B62B45EDdE56cd03b2ebD28eCf9929", "created": 1624217963, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmRxx3xE7AtKs5sdoL5e7pEhFb2k2KpXyR7BL96edgULa1", "voter": "0x51A7aC913D75D4423223Ee28bf954D3306a7b011", "created": 1624196989, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmYgpVbCybXZhFW2f9cCSEbePRBL1G3oZ8k1R8kXP15JwR", "voter": "0x4BD49374BcbE3704c7b482173049B1002eed3B2E", "created": 1624188918, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmbUQ1cbk4cQvVhrVZSv5p39Qca9o3o2Svb8oXQiauSry2", "voter": "0xe264886FEb92E9c6A92fA196DFDC09D330B66c17", "created": 1624188157, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmRVTYSGWXirdxhSTKHZYM7W6qNyY6qi9yowtk24hdZMeQ", "voter": "0x79afbd4B5606EFaB1ea25315734E035D92328be7", "created": 1624179579, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmPhSP61MmZDsMcraemmyqzmYMo6D5rfQCyPndnEmvGZUn", "voter": "0xAE91CB00C413A8D6089Ba0bc8bF66fbA47A912Ea", "created": 1624179105, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
