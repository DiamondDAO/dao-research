The following governance framework is proposed to manage this. This proposal seeks discussion and approval over this framework.\n\n[Link to Grant Station governance framework](https://www.notion.so/Grant-Station-Governance-Framework-478b0fbff17348d7a15a0360da789091)\n\n### Background\nSo far, Rari's founding members have been responsible for nearly all developer contributions for Rari's products. Even non-technical work such as community moderation, management of resources and so on has falled primarily on their shoulders.\n\nMore recently however, the set of contributors has been expanded with the hires of [myself](https://forums.rari.capital/d/56-rip-24-collaboration-with-samuel-shadrach/6), [Sharad Shekar](https://forums.rari.capital/d/61-rip-25-collaboration-with-sharad-shekar-frontend-dev/4) and [Gautham Elango](https://forums.rari.capital/d/65-rip-26-collaboration-with-gautham-elango-solidityreact-dev/12).\n\nA proper governance framework would help streamline this expansion process.\n\n### Abstract\nThese are the broad decisions that need to be undertaken in the grant process.\n\n1. Approve the core concept / task as beneficial to Rari\n2. Approve a payment for this\n3. Approve a specific individual or group to complete the work\n4. Approve the work done by this individual as satifactory, in order to finally release payment\n1 and 2 have been clubbed in the form of a Concept proposal. 3 is an Implementation proposal. 4 is a Payment release proposal\n\nAll proposals go first through forum and then snapshot. This slows down the process but ensures full decentralisation and transparency at every step, not just the final vote.\n\n### Motivation\nCommunity involvement in the Rari Capital has so far primarily been discussion and approval for key decisions, and feedback over what features should be implemented. Allowing more contibutors to work on Rari and negotiate directly with the DAO provides the broader community with a lot more direct control over the future of Rari.\n\nHiring more contributors enables work to get done at a faster pace, which is hugely beneficial.\n\nEven community members who do not wish to work on Rari themselves are more empowered as they can now ideate, and get concepts and grants for those approved by the DAO in the form of a Concept proposal. This is major improvement over the status quo where only informal feature requests could be made.", "choices": ["Approve this gov framework", "Do not approve"], "start": 1622921400, "end": 1623094200, "snapshot": "12576318", "state": "closed", "author": "0x552C35f51A52fa1bF1CA481A9a57D464474248D2", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 14, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmbNtV4FCY3LRXySqLHp5t1VyZddqptdUHBhdgWoGWjKLB", "voter": "0xB64afFEfbb8df2bba35D37bD8Ff6A6e6620987cE", "created": 1623093237, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmfN8NuS4NLAKLDyeGhh7bXngnhuN3wuaAvE7zNpqPWGA7", "voter": "0xEefD4ec15437568210e77181A3f61c3201f8554E", "created": 1623091625, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmYt6Z3CP58zdM8RZFqmCtYecXFGg6igZfRMvuffbM7138", "voter": "0xf9c18F2D1EA93e9A36507F238CFFc6f0Ad7D6eb3", "created": 1623091573, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmW2YECKk3bCSevXmWm8peDvP8iaKSynqYCdvuByZDqZ3X", "voter": "0x6680B1129d802df66cffe1A9F87BB21D17A0e10B", "created": 1623091087, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmPAhW3CiFBihwRoNy9VaX6s9JBdL7tnEv6XrxXraWEJC7", "voter": "0xE590BA56e5056a34692863c5164AAC541bc54ecd", "created": 1623090146, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qmd8aLAz45kZazWFWssoBQm1y37rzrufVu86uebW4ijb7D", "voter": "0x128e5625e15FdBA91d6CcB1AbDFdC62b5d152b4f", "created": 1623074405, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQQtQEWbmRXrdkDMzdX2AkS5fVGcsSvWC34axa48KRcGu", "voter": "0xa7c64f0989dB5a7a53a2ba57Ae876f13D3a1De0c", "created": 1623040045, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmeXVhme8b4sBr7qQQS9FnXNF9sRPSLUDPMqzvzwFG7AqE", "voter": "0xc67BC45773C0c09f64a03176864f12fe468bc7EB", "created": 1622989755, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmNM7JDbcriETYyWL2FGdkBKsVXiiKkSPyYKyqwta23eQW", "voter": "0x79afbd4B5606EFaB1ea25315734E035D92328be7", "created": 1622989722, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQqfPaqjujE8X8CPELcRc96njuoFHRifmawyhGNUVPdhY", "voter": "0xA82fCEFd303Fa68864b787a5f118b09cE5A4c93d", "created": 1622982953, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmRu1YeMuTCw3sSjo1rnWvw7VSELbJLRSXSHetQPBTrLen", "voter": "0xC06d3307080622d51CE3a5444B0d427dCaaFD7b3", "created": 1622971358, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmWs44i8HUbF5QpYBtTMLCdcmo25ygSyLbP3SAoAXx7UUa", "voter": "0x463c2bB76ccA5504bEed1cAE80499Cad5615b99C", "created": 1622966312, "choice": {"1": 1}, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmPAaVqupnjcMGaw1X9sft4PC4ksDSF2ZZsTQmF3NH2CmP", "voter": "0x33FF74323dF522E44c519B4a9d305A7639f7Cf4f", "created": 1622948905, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmWuB1CjV2EX9F7wVTB5Add2uzrqqgkavX1mL4uSWRaHaA", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1622942129, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
