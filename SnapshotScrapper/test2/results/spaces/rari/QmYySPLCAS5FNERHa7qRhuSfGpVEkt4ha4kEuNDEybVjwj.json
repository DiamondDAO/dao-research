{"id": "QmYySPLCAS5FNERHa7qRhuSfGpVEkt4ha4kEuNDEybVjwj", "title": "Whitelist AsgardDAO as Pool Creator", "body": "Summary\n--\nEnable Asgard to create a Fuse pool for borrowing against staked ASG. Asgard will promote Fuse as the premier way to borrow against Asgard assets.\n\nThis proposal will improve capital efficiency for Asgard asset holders, drive TVL to Rari Fuse, and generate more fees for the Rari DAO.\n\nBackground\n--\nAsgard is a decentralized reserve currency protocol utilizing the ASG token. ASG currently has no lending integrations. There is a lot of demand to borrow against staked ASG (sASG) from our community. We would like to open a Fuse pool to enable them to do so.\n\nAdditional Information\n--\nWe propose an upgradeable pool, governed by the Asgard DAO Policy Team, which would initially feature USDC, DAI, FRAX, wUST and ETH in addition to sASG. sASG would initially be available only as collateral.\n\nVote Details\n--\nFOR: Whitelist the Asgard DAO Policy Team (0xe3DFEcE2Fc903A1280650c05AB471c0413607C1D) as a pool creator on the Rari Fuse platform.\nAGAINST: do nothing.", "choices": ["FOR", "AGAINST"], "start": 1629360000, "end": 1629532800, "snapshot": "13054555", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB34A1922CCcC0707b90D16724e0A0CEC58b6a5C6", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWhCq8tvdLRVxX29pSh4JEsWfiSKJfmcLJ36caoELjNLJ", "voter": "0x227FD2fD881Cc6c99DFCcc0FB40f2B1dc2f3F36E", "created": 1629486896, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmT4iiY637kkZJJTiH396mDoDJ2QHEK6ZWFUdUBuLt6rrz", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1629433183, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qme6Js9SZTdxMj9CRaq7KsoAJUPPEUXEprxPB5mV5L3yot", "voter": "0x9bfDA54A453F503d487f2F32554dE73f03E24853", "created": 1629394225, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmaMtthazhCpaUzHxxBPvDLwTu6g1j2W2hRiT3rdSe3WJE", "voter": "0xEeAF7558be93f1CaECa5A361af905B1D1b99a202", "created": 1629386885, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
