{"id": "QmdGSc1Y66F9aYSoUcoudwrNg5igZAnHg37Dc2fSKMBqKK", "title": "Implementation Proposal: User analytics", "body": "# Summary\nI, platocrat, propose to work for the Rari Capital DAO to implement user analytics for Rari's Fuse pools for payment of 2500 USDC and $2500 worth of RGT.\nImplementation deadline is July 1st, with a 4-day grace period.\n\n# Background\nI'm a dropout from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\nI majored in psychology but took a bunch of courses that interested me, including:\n\n- 2 graduate-level statistics-for-psych courses,\n- 2 graduate-level risk management courses (risk mgmt. for financial institutions, and commodity and currency risk management),\n- applied cryptography,\n- computer science for statistics,\n- options & commodities,\n- options (finance) course,\n- international macro & forecasting,\n- basic statistics\n\nWith my psych and analytical background demonstrated above, I can bring a strong analytical mind to this task in terms of analysis of assets and risk-focused metric design around user behavior.\n\nI can also code in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Solidity, but tbh, I'm no wizard-like Ben or Jet \ud83d\ude05 .\n\nRecently, I've been interning at OptimismPBC since March 16th with the initial role of leading developer experience and community engagement. Although, I ended up trying to help wherever I could. This led me from expanding Optimism's documentation to being the primary point-of-contact for hackers during the Scaling Ethereum hackathon, where I directly helped debug issues with hackers' projects and helped to raise and triage new issues with our stack on GitHub. From the experience I gained from the hackathon, I occasionally helped ChainLink and Synthetix with issues in their integration tests. I also generally helped with smaller GitHub issues and have been the primary Discord support person since I joined Optimism \ud83d\ude42.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/platocrat\nGitHub: https://github.com/platocrat\n\n# Spec of work\nI propose to work for the DAO to help with the following work:\n\nCreate and use advanced metrics to build visualizations (in grafana or a d3 library) of user behaviour such as mean/median loan duration in various pools/assets, mean/median profit or loss for users in various pools/assets, graphs for correlation between market leverage / rates and market prices of assets, average wealth of user - fish or whale, other protocols used by most common Fuse users, and so on, return rates for users who make losses or encounter \u201cbad\u201d Fuse pool behaviour. More/different/custom metrics will be used (tbd.) that are tailored to better understanding users of Fuse pools.\n\nMetrics not pre-defined here will be listed in an additional section at the bottom of this proposal.\n\nI will consult with @t11s to learn the proper calls to the fuse pool contracts.\nI will also consult with the team on ways to improve Fuse in light of this data.\nI am also willing to provide continuous support/development for the visualizations I create.\n\n# Timeline\nFrom whenever this proposal is accepted until July 1st, with a 4-day delay, at most.\n\n# Payment\n2500 USDC and $2500 worth of RGT", "choices": ["Approve", "No change"], "start": 1623343200, "end": 1623516000, "snapshot": "12607881", "state": "closed", "author": "0x82a05859F79368b03e92d7588603E431fa24E4Ef", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZwua6AchhLXf3hVt29GsJsi9uAhZnCN7bjMtU7bbUMxm", "voter": "0xF089106b4173DA59593e01C78590FDcA62fB05E5", "created": 1623506787, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmYoSTduvM43XCsVnDNSUj9eKxXjKAP6M7cmfS8TiKis1N", "voter": "0xD9b49a81ee72aF3C026a2C144C9Ffd678A78C8b1", "created": 1623503192, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmXm2GC5fe4sJkPqEdXj2pxEXyRUf6Tzg6PohDpBxi4zAn", "voter": "0xC71deD6f0E5660DFe79C849058Afd9BE7a3c85b8", "created": 1623502473, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmR7P2jBnJ1mBftNktPcvzv1KCZAktx4pHUc3bjFxN2iZq", "voter": "0xC16623Cb1505c57C56B3dd9633DbB43991ab2804", "created": 1623474832, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmVSyD1wJ74r7ZznJ8X9NR1oH89LC1QirYTXi2S9VHYp2W", "voter": "0xb7Ef6B04858B967f65Dc595Ec70Ee9E3133963E7", "created": 1623454846, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmdZH3NN6ajRFFx9A7K5azvGVoffFNKuNFby2p6ccxj5aC", "voter": "0xcF6CE779dC8DF985b19eBE76F537462B67af3765", "created": 1623445460, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmUfJtuZMMbHNhyRVaqFvHGpjcTouupHGMPsHeXQzR5h96", "voter": "0xDcE62b21A8B1A9b39dD3ded27C876d416CC91B3e", "created": 1623386719, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmYj2UchQpQnSx1CAtYjKQAP2EEzsSmkDL1c317s1oHUV5", "voter": "0x8733593b6418be9A0CCDEF9BbB8C0CC4E7bE88aC", "created": 1623376232, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmZbeLLUnrCKANX7aAf64ns1ZuNmiXYnC2bPb19UtGt7Ws", "voter": "0xfE99Cb7011E55F1dD8C376f9134e24EF8a10B14d", "created": 1623369626, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmNSmNUvgHaGTThymBe3SQYJdqHDndW5erj6qv3P5TSHmY", "voter": "0x37fEEb6b8067D1185b9e1F25d184dcc61fD2d105", "created": 1623366646, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQAA7G2juXbVNRqX43iBoPjPPocf5JbH3c6dUzjy65XLw", "voter": "0xb19BE18A7D279432F607676Acd34c62fF932daba", "created": 1623366129, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmczDjQf7D1Yc4HqvxCvG522BqYnwpzJb9FY5Tgx1q2t4g", "voter": "0x128e5625e15FdBA91d6CcB1AbDFdC62b5d152b4f", "created": 1623363169, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQHygFm2QPC74CqrHgJYnFubNFbo5dUa6YTtm4upm7tYG", "voter": "0x58C6cD2b53d41d06bfB7D33624D2835C011E61BE", "created": 1623363117, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmU7v8bV2U9KQTp1CEtNbSJb5prWEfUAGnjVQYbzNDioRV", "voter": "0xa4B2772c88925c043888E3Da8b5723D5C53F9776", "created": 1623360791, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmRpejWBUZjyowugPdkTCRFG3AooYsYdY7ERvVphXUkWEo", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1623345750, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmPT8TsexsrX72QSnm2RPNKkfFpAxhMVef6VBebQgYLpzb", "voter": "0x29bee0B61306DB9630834EeAC098c1635124A3F1", "created": 1623344693, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
