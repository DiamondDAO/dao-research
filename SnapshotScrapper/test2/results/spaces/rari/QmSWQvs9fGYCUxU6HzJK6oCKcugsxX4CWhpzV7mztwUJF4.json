I specialise in 2D illustration. I mostly do character designs but recently I began to focus on illustrations that aim to bring classical art back into the modern time. I am heavily influenced and inspired by ancient art, philosophy, modern comics, Japanese modern and ancient art, spirituality.\nI would describe my art style as focused on dark outlines with powerful, bold colours. It has a sombre feel to it, inspired by gothic art and ambience and aims to be impactful while also communicate the emotion behind it.\nI recently became inspired by the surge in NFT popularity and have started posting and selling my works on Makersplace.\n\nPlease find a link to my gallery on ArtStation: https://www.artstation.com/derectumart\nAnd my gallery on Makersplace for a collection of NFTs: https://makersplace.com/derectum/\n\nSpecification\n\nI propose to work closely with the DAO for the creation of a unique artwork.\nThe Rari brand is inspired by cars, specifically Ferrari. Ferrari is associated with fast cars and sleek, sharp curves and style. Within their modern designs, especially, Ferrari prides itself in its artistic style. In the words of their chief design officer, Flavio Manzoni, their aim was: \u201cto combine art and science. There is a very close relationship between form and content, between the external surface and internal components.\u201d\nDesign is not the only element of this brand, however. Speed is what matters. Fast cars, fast technology, faster than before. Fast and modern. Rari works within the emergent crypto market. You take pride in being precursors of a new future based on this new technology and the speed with which it strides forward.\nWithin art, speed and the excitement of new technology has been represented by Futurism.\n\nA few words on Futurism\nFuturism was an artistic and cultural time in Italy (which is no coincidence, I believe, since Ferrari is an Italian brand). It explored the idea of speed, it embraced a time of innovation and great technological advancement. Their art reflected a modern way of life, detached from the past.\n\nMy proposal involves the resurrection and re-interpretation of one particular art piece, namely \u201cDynamism of a Car\u201d by Luigi Russolo (1913). I propose to create a unique artwork inspired by this piece. I think this painting reflects very well the ideas behind the Rari brand. Speed, here, is literally created through the brush strokes.\nThe Rari brand elements will also be incorporated within the artwork.\nMy own style is very close to this. If you explore a few of my most recent works in my gallery, you\u2019ll find a few re-interpretations of ancient works, re-created within a personal and modern style (eg. A.Mantegna\u2019s Amore and Psyche).\nI aim to do the same with the painting described above.\nThe artwork will be created as both a .png file and it will be sent as an NFT in whatever format is requested.\n(PNG is the safest file format for digital art and its size is very small)\n\nCommunication\nI suggest a communication between me and the original creators of the Rari brand for the incorporation of necessary design elements. Shapes, colours or branding elements can be incorporated within the artwork.\n\nTimeline\nFrom whenever this proposal is accepted I would require 10 days to complete the project. This would involve a communication with the people at Rari involved in the design and any changes required I will try to implement within that time-frame. However, if there is a massive discrepancy between my original idea and your own vision, then I propose we discuss the addition of a few days.\n\nPayment\n500USD or equivalent.\nArtists like me thrive only on networking and connections. If satisfied with my work (and my work-ethic!), I could use your recommendation outside of this channel!\n\nThank you!\n", "choices": ["Sure, sounds great!", "How about No!"], "start": 1626951600, "end": 1627124400, "snapshot": "12875190", "state": "closed", "author": "0x30f0cdf6b355d70023729c24C2771a1b969c7c1B", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmU7dRJo6y5iHWEZQK9PR3wpuk2dbTdTDoJb9yakDgpyfr", "voter": "0x3A70e8C00f3bCf3eb845B6b6928AbA92b465C183", "created": 1627124121, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmYweoZa38DG1e4V4nVfRAaFKk2hgv3Rk6XXfdZKnAbqbE", "voter": "0x28a6a38aED085131373842e502Ff9f957c42D897", "created": 1627115765, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmSJByT6uxHjp5AG9zYaetzVWWFGcCY5j8gA6tm7dyMAd8", "voter": "0xF089106b4173DA59593e01C78590FDcA62fB05E5", "created": 1627098058, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmS7NCu2trmHzp8LHFLRMYha3wehswbLsQTzjqs3TSStco", "voter": "0x6cB5FceFa0037c373aD1Ec7717874117D353bF49", "created": 1627091245, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmSFeY8wUsq9EigdqLrPsHUtnU9zY4ctZvMfTYRQ2pnboc", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1627056296, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmPbbqE9e9QzsWq7JkYoxcheRFDirK7oHB6v92eerSsfmk", "voter": "0xDFE7ad3E0cc6fb0798e66C67C72927C49fc42478", "created": 1627050350, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmdPSBhFNek6ZdMPVnNv6fAdbo6G3MAf5hhEHB2sezSqNC", "voter": "0x4ABc33CF81e0d21f42168d044f7002eDd6b80B09", "created": 1627024730, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
