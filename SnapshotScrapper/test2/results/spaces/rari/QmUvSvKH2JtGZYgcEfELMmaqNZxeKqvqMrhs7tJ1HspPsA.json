This would give visiblity to a pool that focused around ETH and RAI as well as their derivatives with high collateral ratios.\n\n## Background\n\nReflexer is one of the earliest users of Fuse starting with pool 9 which now has $20M TVL. We would now like to make a second, more degen pool focused on improving capital efficiency for RAI derivative tokens.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nPool 46 will start with ETH, RAI, aRAI, sETH2 and wstETH and expand to other RAI derivatives such as Idle RAI.\n\n## Vote Details\n\nFOR: Whitelist Reflexer (0xfA5e4955a11902f849ECaddEf355Db69C2036de6) and the Reflexer Governor (0xa57A4e6170930ac547C147CdF26aE4682FA8262E) as pool creators on the Rari Fuse platform.\nAGAINST: Do nothing.", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1634256000, "end": 1634428800, "snapshot": "13419275", "state": "closed", "author": "0xfA5e4955a11902f849ECaddEf355Db69C2036de6", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmevzERtxEGrzX6MD7R2ur155D8Wwc4rKKHHh6mDqoF5X6", "voter": "0x227FD2fD881Cc6c99DFCcc0FB40f2B1dc2f3F36E", "created": 1634419995, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmRuMQJp2v1PuvUSVfpzZfStyCagw4HsiVVmfeyAojy3oC", "voter": "0xFCA53097013c05083cf2AeF0d2a4cfE8d2b8d90B", "created": 1634377914, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmVUphwEXkMzZpAA6F73S6QXgeN1FWvzxT9VmBMKAepzis", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1634327715, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmTUtVfBk2tdtLPLUxZ4cx8nJGKnbz89a6dfTyv6D7XEG4", "voter": "0x6a26afb01Ff57e827079658238858d55774cA2D5", "created": 1634323091, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmTrDo4gGpfnxzSUiTiEEMew11dX8tR5SGBoRN2PQHXiBg", "voter": "0xddA42f12B8B2ccc6717c053A2b772baD24B08CbD", "created": 1634321616, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmYp8iR4fibFjmzxwyvBo7iTysHW256oa3wWA3AdHrMT2h", "voter": "0xEeAF7558be93f1CaECa5A361af905B1D1b99a202", "created": 1634320234, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmNfhenBB78gqeABZRydmxqhapuDdnaDinRewNQJ8MzTYE", "voter": "0x09DA2d53C9d7e569e428b7F4A5c82C7CD855a7D4", "created": 1634312719, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmPtZSpgtRzCw65pwAVZy5GRwxiyLYBnqkkZh43hn9ADpo", "voter": "0x71FBFe41A9ddEDd13Ef25a337faE01438064a08d", "created": 1634281919, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
