The goal of this proposal is to create an LUSD Fuse Pool along with FEI, FRAX, DAI, and USDC.\n\n**We\u2019d like the Rari Capital DAO to manage this pool**\n\n### Background:\nLiquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows users to draw interest-free loans against ETH as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD (a USD-pegged stablecoin) and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of 110%. Loans are secured by the Stability Pool, where users can deposit LUSD and provide up-front capital to offset uncollateralized debt. In return, they receive ETH collateral when liquidations occur and continuous LQTY rewards (our secondary token).\nLiquity is also governance-free and immutable with no admin keys. All operations are algorithmic and fully automated, and protocol parameters to maintain system health were set at time of contract deployment.\n\n### Contracts:\nLUSD Token Address: 0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0\nChainlink LUSD Price Feed: 0x3D7aE7E594f2f2091Ad8798313450130d0Aba3a0\n\n### Initial pool parameters:\nUpgradeable: Yes\nClose Factor: 0.5\nLiquidation Incentive: 8%\nLUSD Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 75% / 10%\nFEI Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 75% / 10%\nFRAX Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 75% / 10%\nDAI Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 75% / 10%\nUSDC Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 75% / 10%\n\n### Motivation:\nCurrently, LUSD is not available for lending and borrowing on other money-markets. This creates a unique opportunity for Rari to be among the first, if not the first, to support LUSD.\n\n~$500M of the LUSD supply is in the Stability Pool, some of which Rari can capture and increase TVL. This is especially likely considering Rari usually boasts high APYs.", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1634230800, "end": 1634403600, "snapshot": "13417860", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7c270e3e263AB7E4dbb024f83225c71c5eCbc523", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmWyDk3RnrtUCBQLVTBqFQjeMRo7EriDcEPVsFyca4bP3j", "voter": "0xd6Fd705EE0B31a9300D3E2154bccE777270CBb6f", "created": 1634390717, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmZzwHXJPaFnFj7v4B4Kns2vMqf5S2nNrXb7rCtNuJAneL", "voter": "0xFCA53097013c05083cf2AeF0d2a4cfE8d2b8d90B", "created": 1634377937, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmZjGU4jjJuEMr5g7evKG4BDLMRFEYcy1vpXkgGa9FjZZm", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1634327747, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQERx8NoRumEfd6rm25Z82xXss9zfqoB465LNgazVau6J", "voter": "0x6a26afb01Ff57e827079658238858d55774cA2D5", "created": 1634323078, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmNLyStWwkAvAonhTeP7oFvJhHUd5WzNPFN376nCFQjybp", "voter": "0xddA42f12B8B2ccc6717c053A2b772baD24B08CbD", "created": 1634321675, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmY9Ex7LScGgoVDvGpvtwErzJ65fJEAzfS9zUTdYPdzjH3", "voter": "0xEeAF7558be93f1CaECa5A361af905B1D1b99a202", "created": 1634320256, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmU5krEPp3TRMSSdXBEHLwk6ZBCYGsced5iegwnLSjQUjw", "voter": "0x09DA2d53C9d7e569e428b7F4A5c82C7CD855a7D4", "created": 1634312758, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmZA782pQzjuMTuJApNk5Fb5CXTHiPjnJwXzvQdQeHDV2y", "voter": "0xDFE7ad3E0cc6fb0798e66C67C72927C49fc42478", "created": 1634263435, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qmf7n1FVdkFZExf5R7EQp5Y3pTkqwu8D3inWerEZpPehPX", "voter": "0x1bEfFf674D2e4E72A29CA97140e5aB3D89CC778C", "created": 1634260377, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
