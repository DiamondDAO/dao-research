We\u2019ve come up with (and begun building) several initiatives outlined in this deck that we are confident will both build awareness of the Rari brand in the general public and also penetrate and connect with the existing Rari community.\n\nAbstract:\n\nWe propose an 8-week partnership with Rari to get heads turning about the brand and connect with our community in consistent yet exciting ways. In order to build a long-term brand, now more than ever Rari needs to focus on building awareness in the community and serving users in both crypto-centric and non-crypto-centric ways outlined in the deck attached to this proposal.\n\nIn the deck, we\u2019ve outlined 28 ways we\u2019ll help Rari catapult it\u2019s growth trajectory and set up long-term success for the brand. Aside from community engagement, we believe focusing on upper-funnel objectives are paramount to building a sustainable brand presence, so that\u2019s what many of these ideas aim to do.\n\nWe ask for 500 RGT in compensation for our services and an additional 5000 USDT from the Treasury to fund product development and marketing costs.\n\nMotivation: The best brands aren\u2019t built accidentally \u2013 they created big stories that genuinely connect with existing and new users. Rari is the most ambitious and hungriest team ever, so let\u2019s make sure our marketing matches.\n\nFOR: Partner with Layer3 to launch growth initiatives outlined in the deck attached. Pay ~500 RGT + 5000 USDT (for marketing + development costs)\nAGAINST: Do not partner with Layer3 and do not launch these growth initiatives\n\nTwitter: @layer3xyz or @dariyaxyz\nWebsite: https://layer3.xyz", "choices": ["Partner, pay 525 RGT + 5000 USDT", "Partner, pay 500 RGT + 5000 USDT", "Partner, pay 475 RGT + 5000 USDT", "Do not partner, no growth"], "start": 1622095200, "end": 1622268000, "snapshot": "12512902", "state": "closed", "author": "0x36D6d9c6316bE80367762b835aAec64574249b4B", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 20, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmT6ykPZovXc9rFwoY5fcbbzzncFnLZDVdnTZngW9TrkaB", "voter": "0x4e99BfBEE1020138eACC68a32eD7Fc6DD2EFc08f", "created": 1622249678, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmXpuEGrPusRvYfajoYUZ7AsmoJZ5NpmHzbggR5HcAetuX", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1622245593, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmXXpg74dmhNgxGhEwCnNGyZaZQqT9FACismjYQDKXvke2", "voter": "0x128e5625e15FdBA91d6CcB1AbDFdC62b5d152b4f", "created": 1622243934, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmUkUFgwp9PPxvSacKrWthN1MaDy6U6ecCtskMz2QYJhri", "voter": "0xb19BE18A7D279432F607676Acd34c62fF932daba", "created": 1622234811, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmUy9QL2JLvNQxy15HpMKyhb8NYwoUu49EBqpWLvkFiKWA", "voter": "0x87ce852cE248aFd15F3A35d9E13aEc4A4AacAca2", "created": 1622223243, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmZX6LuUfXoHB77oJTPX1j6ZdTvzLR8Es3azhugDpe82T2", "voter": "0x9Ad2fDC0c515C2FE5358AcD8B641F799E64E0C5c", "created": 1622169728, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmZkQF1DHSrgXqv7qNPUMqyPUvBSPqkQJrYvYH5VP7xX92", "voter": "0x532f2be5392C5094DD89893c20AeEa3B9a3F2DB6", "created": 1622157620, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmTyjgCiiR7xZnjdeJexX55pUX88cakjYEGVkGHQAwPwLA", "voter": "0x8534584b52Fa2b4c7239B35E748116f8365AE83c", "created": 1622157497, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmWG2mh6mEH6Vxb9d8DBtVMUkyGCeWZApKez6tDHB6b66y", "voter": "0xfBf360bcb3992E8e818d078f72f1A9454a3D9Ea1", "created": 1622157452, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmSeNwwPA5BTYQpsZX87EeHGdHbGd1pnsSreAQvfMi7Pa9", "voter": "0x47aC710D34935ac3b3BDB73bD0354eE63AAE1cd1", "created": 1622157439, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmaGwtBXgzn64sfMaStobnALDJz2r82cSvUse1uJfeCujv", "voter": "0x5723d94fceeE34ac60536f52FEA04d9c31e71919", "created": 1622157429, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQDMsJzyQ51ak526vT4hh99taFcdDjj893EQZ4yorCnWx", "voter": "0x33B38dAAe528F9741b3e43743D6fce6cb8bA2dF9", "created": 1622157419, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qme42922ymBa7k6Rdm3LQo9VmMyLeqap7xUZUM6vPJGLqu", "voter": "0x597593CfEf7ce37dB2FC3C6BC50b80C0004571D1", "created": 1622157410, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmSVwYizeVHSrfDbrW5XBwBopQbidW17yuuovGsdDT3Bg7", "voter": "0xEefD4ec15437568210e77181A3f61c3201f8554E", "created": 1622157311, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmVAGa1pePfJHS2RVNBYcqUoQWWyVTBSAKmtgfbYF1PahS", "voter": "0xf9c18F2D1EA93e9A36507F238CFFc6f0Ad7D6eb3", "created": 1622146845, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmUqMP9fUi5H1Q3A8z74m3up2mr596Q5yYEsMVds3PoZJV", "voter": "0xfB953D5c69bB04461b74e13655072eaE8fB384Da", "created": 1622133840, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmNtpbkErGYvQJPqF2MsdBjXeoakTTZxMJ1vXua6WbLTbn", "voter": "0xDFE7ad3E0cc6fb0798e66C67C72927C49fc42478", "created": 1622127917, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmektySSdU53gzDuYVqfdrCvxHLTPeTfak5RoWDMzg5mGv", "voter": "0x2c682357aF557244f91C7C76855D435AE0f154cd", "created": 1622125669, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmZ26aMeuzggQCkvRUaVpstT8F7AnkKsmQ4CWPe86aYYDs", "voter": "0x666eeDF593D66a3dF42A484C0D337e2E484bAA9A", "created": 1622124909, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmVN2p8ZaHtoNmLs2om3phiaFY8GiNkiDTH3fgfLTx6soY", "voter": "0x79afbd4B5606EFaB1ea25315734E035D92328be7", "created": 1622105555, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
