In elementary school, I gradually taught myself JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, tools that would allow me to progress to where I am today.\n\nI met Jai on the school bus in 2016, but our business relationship began in 2018, when I did some work on a product-management dashboard for internal use. Later that year, Jai invited me to work at Ambo as the lead frontend web developer. Both of these opportunities provided me with experience and expertise necessary for development at Rari.\n\nHere is a list of some of my recent work:\n- [**Ambo**](https://ambo.io/) - Ambo, founded by Jai Bhavnani and Jack Lipstone, is an app designed to make it simple for laymen to invest in cryptocurrency. The project was acquired in January 2019 by [MyCrypto](https://www.mycrypto.com/). At Ambo, I worked as the lead frontend web developer. In that role, I created frontend interfaces and connected them to the Ethereum network using web3.js.\n- [**Schoop**](https://blog.schoop.app/) - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I created an app for students at my school to organize their virtual learning schedules. Students can input their classes and Zoom links, and they can see the schedule for each day in a clean user interface. Schedules can also be emailed if students opt in. Currently, over 20% of the student body is registed on Schoop. I'm currently building v2 of the app, which uses Firebase and React to improve user experience and reduce operation costs.\n- **Themus** - Last summer, I participated in the LaunchX entrepreneurship program, which groups young entrepreneurs to create \"startups\" in a six-week period. My group created Themus, a service that uses artificial intelligence to analyze product reviews to help consumers find the best products for their needs. In my role, I built a demo analyzer tool using Next.js and Firebase, and I devised a method to spin up temporary GCP instances for AI sentiment analysis.\n\nI have also taken several computer science courses at school, such as AP Computer Science A and Honors Advanced Topics in Computer Science, which have improved my understanding of computers as well as my code. Because I have now exhausted my school's computer science offerings, I will be taking two [Global Online Academy](https://globalonlineacademy.org/) courses next year\u2014one in cybersecurity and another in data science.\n\nIf you'd like more information about my experience, you can also [view my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ztlT51bJYLCDn6xVKGDdUuTP0Xx9FHPA/view?usp=sharing). And if you're more technically inclined, you might also wish to [see my GitHub](https://github.com/zane-programs).\n\n## Abstract\nI propose to work for the DAO to build an interest-rate comparison view, implementing designs made by Jai Bhavnani. [Here's a rough prototype with mocked data](https://gfycat.com/frayedjitterykite).\n\nThis development will take place over a trial period of 1 week for a payment of 60 RGT, subject to DAO approval.\n\nCompletion leads to the potential of full-time conversion.\n\n## Motivation\nCreating a view to compare interest rates across Aave, Compound Finance, and Fuse pools will allow users to make informed decisions about where they lend and borrow their assets at any given time, thereby optimizing the use of their assets.\n\n# Voting\n\n## For\nApprove creation of the interest rate comparison view.\n\n## Against\nReject creation of the interest rate comparison view.", "choices": ["Approve", "Reject"], "start": 1624813200, "end": 1624986000, "snapshot": "12717261", "state": "closed", "author": "0xEeAF7558be93f1CaECa5A361af905B1D1b99a202", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 22, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTpkzrjD5MxtH8Un6K3KLg5VNNHhSM9FnYYWGmhtk8Vt3", "voter": "0xfE99Cb7011E55F1dD8C376f9134e24EF8a10B14d", "created": 1624975638, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmfQqakDKtN86Vx8VPd1qh2kkXiycEhV4eHSzWmmLu9wS6", "voter": "0x4BD49374BcbE3704c7b482173049B1002eed3B2E", "created": 1624967358, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmdedM5VVBN1Xt9CFFkvRHA8DvWTZvVaeL7UucGt2DBhru", "voter": "0xF089106b4173DA59593e01C78590FDcA62fB05E5", "created": 1624952488, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmWcbMJXK3yeGefV1SaiJsVvNogsatDosHNQWgg6fUcTqy", "voter": "0xa7c64f0989dB5a7a53a2ba57Ae876f13D3a1De0c", "created": 1624940603, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmWEP1x6upQQArtdtqTEfkfu8ipGPz41cTWfd8quWqRr8e", "voter": "0xDcE62b21A8B1A9b39dD3ded27C876d416CC91B3e", "created": 1624938294, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmbsJj49xqEaTRWR1ToTcxDK4WVB5GnwgrrJTGQW5ek7cd", "voter": "0x1c6F4dfc666da461a42e9b5D890C1d1ec5c6Ba16", "created": 1624934493, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmWi2mAxmjWCNTPJsMcnieGBmDEwyPPRb2Fb45v4bn2t2V", "voter": "0x01D07347ef0cA54bbf85F03611c93897c8E9D652", "created": 1624913395, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmYRiuXcbRE3rNVnMbA8L9qwTcnZjj77E995kyVRDCae1k", "voter": "0xfd2bF23a646227431Bc935897cA3285ad2a5c82A", "created": 1624911815, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmNUZqTdqSZVxEuCFb4UfzEyPwRPUxEcCAJPx581v98LSs", "voter": "0xf286E07ED6889658A3285C05C4f736963cF41456", "created": 1624896647, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmTpCoBqubNXM9esoCWXqgE6RL2gNA8hkCeDyjcP9Q1Q4s", "voter": "0x128e5625e15FdBA91d6CcB1AbDFdC62b5d152b4f", "created": 1624895818, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmUEQe4vP4bZuM7afjbE9xDqPGqTVJyJDudy1M8Gvu2guf", "voter": "0x0708b2E432223D83933Ef37eD3eB41167B41C559", "created": 1624873826, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmRuCmBPZ975ZuBZQQ9YhAQr9xGm2ca58HjFaAAvQQp89L", "voter": "0x28a6a38aED085131373842e502Ff9f957c42D897", "created": 1624855900, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmTHB2o5m48kWMMouxoN4FAWxSr3L9HxAy9TfcymKXidCd", "voter": "0x201b5Abfd44A8F9b75F0fE1BaE74CDaC7675E54B", "created": 1624850488, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmNZGM3HP73RrEX1MZBViRQgfzdQ1xLgZp6Spep49AsKWF", "voter": "0xC71deD6f0E5660DFe79C849058Afd9BE7a3c85b8", "created": 1624843446, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmeUv4cVKcgab7Eevkyftx3Deex9MzpbwnDvYcgxAvvLmi", "voter": "0x666eeDF593D66a3dF42A484C0D337e2E484bAA9A", "created": 1624842837, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmYrMVdmPUPggq1zj7CyrSYsr2KQ7YSPbTP3sifynVavMk", "voter": "0x465623b2cE74e0eB844C382D76a900C32566c46B", "created": 1624835356, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qmd2NB1rgLwUAoKmRGfbc7iTTRZFEMtp5f1TS5sKsFV44S", "voter": "0xF70323Aff2127BD8C76078ac052e01cf424038B2", "created": 1624830579, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmZySKkbLBwHGNNncPCEC3Zf1w6L2Buf8huwbXfMLfsRWK", "voter": "0x32B9f064cC3c219a61d875e26565cDCe5859E0e9", "created": 1624822985, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmNsSTf1xE6dL6TdYFj4zUS9u6JNefe8LjJuQp3zxtUUjr", "voter": "0x227FD2fD881Cc6c99DFCcc0FB40f2B1dc2f3F36E", "created": 1624819920, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmPRFiidcsnaXCAUoJ7uX28DiTQ9tQP7zagf1jjVKgbLAD", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1624819890, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmUYFXoUV4GD7L2Bupg4LyQcNed31FgHUDcXznibhaFf57", "voter": "0xb7Ef6B04858B967f65Dc595Ec70Ee9E3133963E7", "created": 1624816941, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmS5GVRZfqXqXMxwRj8irGZRgJinC3jJ226NirC52aFqMR", "voter": "0x9C0790Eb0F96B16Ea1806e20B0D0E21A31DC93BC", "created": 1624813664, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
