DeFi was getting really big, and I wanted to be a part of that so I started learning web development. That was around last June and it was a little hard and slow at first because of my job, but then on February of this year I was able to start freelancing as a web developer and have been doing that since then.\n\nI don't have any experience with DeFi projects yet, but I'm actively looking to contribute and build a reputation in the space. I have experience with:\n\nReact\nNodejs\nJavascript\nTypescript\nExpress, Apollo Server\nDocker\nKubernetes\nNginx\nSolidity\nMongo DB\nSQL\nAnd I love UX/UI design.\n\nSpecifications\n\nDuring development, the code would be available in a public GitHub repo - that way my progress is trackable and completely transparent at all times. The platform would be developed with React and Typescript, and hosted in fleek/IPFS to ensure censorship resistance and integrity of the audited source code.\n\nIf there are any features that you'd like included please submit a proposal so that the Rari community can vote and discuss e.g. graphs that should be implemented, info that you would like displayed in the layout. The idea is to develop a seamless user experience for the Rari yield/fuse pools.\n\nI would also provide continuous support and feature integration for the project after its been delivered. \n\n\nPayment\n\n3500 USDT and an additional 500$ worth of RGT. Payment release would be requested upon completion of the work, after code is audited by the Rari Team.\n\nTimeline\n\nThe platform would be delivered by the 15th of July with a 4 day delay at most. I'm asking for an extended amount of time to ensure the highest quality.", "choices": ["Approve", "Disapprove"], "start": 1623693600, "end": 1623866400, "snapshot": "12634381", "state": "closed", "author": "0x43F8734296cFc0e41F9ee00e468B23AFA09b7d13", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXdK9qhnF5r8Cy5bto4FhwFognzCMWfQGMSq3CcrwJkcZ", "voter": "0x4BD49374BcbE3704c7b482173049B1002eed3B2E", "created": 1623848414, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmSaLFypzoSw3DQMMrs8kd2LcVrySpRyek6Rr1jBPVuKh8", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1623824409, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmPbWmgctEBV2Tk2mpjtXwH8zW6KS8ctdUQxvHvQLR7yL1", "voter": "0xb7Ef6B04858B967f65Dc595Ec70Ee9E3133963E7", "created": 1623808768, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmTMKSezPUNhKfQWYbNpUyYAiPg5A9RWDebvTKHnPa5Y9M", "voter": "0xce90F7f63fb5C7CAA43bD6A9108949112397fEAf", "created": 1623799231, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmUY1XTPBirn5AbZbE3H75gV8FuppYVtk3LgvWZYGGYEd9", "voter": "0xC71deD6f0E5660DFe79C849058Afd9BE7a3c85b8", "created": 1623792309, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmPN2W2cwJrF1D2acNPWAw4SPEhYj4pX1La55r4s86Dfv9", "voter": "0x14fAA125c62AC8Cfe9fCd2D97Ac05347C93Fbe6C", "created": 1623771254, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmNhdznxNbFhNXYzojezWKvwF9CbPL2ahn5bRsQvFcUgER", "voter": "0x975CC4Ef1Ae67e1eDecadB7072a93faeD5552Fa1", "created": 1623757633, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmPPcDPXgpmJ9ETUTG26fVddwkGVwTbY6apiAHZahJeJwT", "voter": "0x2d53114198627E085cF2169b316738b8A9109C83", "created": 1623754832, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmNLwfDrtCAL2xjy7q3W8J9Es8g7KXKrCQT6xbBjzzcX1C", "voter": "0x532f2be5392C5094DD89893c20AeEa3B9a3F2DB6", "created": 1623734856, "choice": [1], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmSVinzrwyxzaYhKM6oHs3f2w19vzhtvkSpnwC2RQPYaB3", "voter": "0x666eeDF593D66a3dF42A484C0D337e2E484bAA9A", "created": 1623723108, "choice": [2], "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmP7hs7STPuz48L6bmAg84jR6nVutjZEBHAJV7KG63Ra6M", "voter": "0x8D51A9Ddd59064F719D98b6a9B2f073811227c5e", "created": 1623699598, "choice": [2], "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
