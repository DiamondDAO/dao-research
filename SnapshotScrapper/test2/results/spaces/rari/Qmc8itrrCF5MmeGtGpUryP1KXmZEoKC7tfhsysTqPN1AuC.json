The top vote recipient will receive $3,858.91 that has previously been deposited into the fund. No additional donations will be made at this time. This gift will deplete the fund.\n\nBackground:\nThe Rari Capital Foundation contains funds that we can send to US based 501(c)(3) organizations. We have $3,858.91 remaining in the Rari Capital Foundation from our donation in November 2020, as of October 1st 2021. \nYou can learn more about Endaoment\u2019s Community Funds here: Endaoment Documentation.\n\nAbstract:\nThis proposal aims to determine which organization will receive funding from the RCF this month.
