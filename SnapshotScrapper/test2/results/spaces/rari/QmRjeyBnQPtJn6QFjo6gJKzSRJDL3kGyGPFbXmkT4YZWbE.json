{"id": "QmRjeyBnQPtJn6QFjo6gJKzSRJDL3kGyGPFbXmkT4YZWbE", "title": "Whitelist MaskDAO as Fuse Pool Creators", "body": "### Summary\n\nWe propose the MaskDAO to be whitelisted as a pool creator. The initial collateral assets for the pool will include $MASK(our governance token), DPI\u2028 (DeFi Pulse Index), USDC, DAI and ETH. In the future, we are also open to either add $MASK in other pools or add other collateral assets in the pool we are going to create.\n\n### Background\n\nMask Network is the core product of Dimension, which is positioned to become the bridge that connects internet users from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. The foundational technology of Mask Network is a peer-to-peer encrypted messaging application, with new functions continuously being created around this foundation. We have integrated decentralized social messaging, borderless payment network, and decentralized file storage and sharing to provide a safe and convenient portal for users to jump right into the continent of decentralized finance and then the new world of Web 3.0.\n\n $MASK is the native token of MaskDAO. The DAO is the owner of the Mask Ecosystem. $MASK holders are members of MaskDAO and possess ownership of the Mask Ecosystem through the DAO. As the native token, $MASK serves as incentives to facilitate governance. Each $MASK represents one vote. Overtime, Mask Network team and ecosystem members will develop more products and services that would accrue value to $MASK. Mask Network will continue to actively engage with top Web 3.0 and DeFi projects as we have done with MetaMask, Mirror, UniSwap, Pancakeswap, Transak, Coinmarketcap etc to expand use cases for $MASK.\n\n### Market Statistics & Info\n\n- $MASK contract address: 0x69af81e73a73b40adf4f3d4223cd9b1ece623074\n- [CoinGecko token link](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mask-network) \n- [Etherscan token link](https://etherscan.io/token/0x69af81e73a73b40adf4f3d4223cd9b1ece623074#balances)\n- Links to Dex liquidity pools\n  - [Sushiswap](https://analytics.sushi.com/tokens/0x69af81e73a73b40adf4f3d4223cd9b1ece623074)\n  - [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/info/token/0x2ed9a5c8c13b93955103b9a7c167b67ef4d568a3)\n  - [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/quick/0x2B9E7ccDF0F4e5B24757c1E1a80e311E34Cb10c7/0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174/0xDEb69421fc2FbA0c3b4F8b1ae291029f7CCa344E) \n- Available on Binance, OKEx, Huobi, Coinbase, Digifinex and other 30+ CEXs\n\n### Motivation\n\n- As of Sep 9 2021, according to Coingecko $MASK market cap is $256,171,314 and average 24hrs trading volume YTD is $66,719,022 with nearly 66 thousand holders. Having $MASK Fuse Pool will will increase Fuse's TVL and increase the utility of collateral assets in the pool.\n\n- MASK Network has an active community with more than 41 thousand followers on Twitter that will be happy to support Fuse by promoting and marketing the utility of $MASK as a collateral on Fuse on social media.\n\n- Recently, Mask Network has started the Social DeFi Alliance with 15 founding partners from DeFi Apps, ecosystem partners, and community & media partners. In the future, we will launch more social DeFi projects for social network users, promote the connection between Web2.0 and Web3.0, guide more top Internet social platform users to access DeFi, and, for the long term, we are dedicated to promoting the large-scale application of Web3.0. We would love to explore the possibility of ecosystem cooperation and integration with Fuse in the future.\n\n### Audit report\n\n[SECBIT](https://pxmcr6lqb3qzyfb7hybmvw5wzm4p5it2seyzl5prgfxlblttjsua.arweave.net/fdgo-XAO4ZwUPz4Cytu2yzj-onqRMZX18TFusK5zTKg) (Feb 22, 2021)\n\n### Links\n\n- [Official Website](https://mask.io/)\n- [Github](https://github.com/DimensionDev)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/realmaskbook) \n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/masknetwork)\n- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cKGW45g)\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/maskbook_group#telegram)\n\n### Address for pool creation: \n[0xEC6bAf1fBb865Fd3Ff3FC83A7B5262003D9ba8bE\n](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEC6bAf1fBb865Fd3Ff3FC83A7B5262003D9ba8bE)\n\n### The Vote: \nVote Yes, to whitelist MaskDAO as Fuse pool creators\n\nVote No, to do nothing.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1631505600, "end": 1631764800, "snapshot": "13203804", "state": "closed", "author": "0x39bc29561ECe95d1058ebd04a388f26287d375a9", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 15, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmcsdg3ZnYYiY8GRYSDaZhwJu7gA6oj5NV4Gs1eG9w7wgN", "voter": "0x7B60A49B8ddCAa77A255D229C219794D191C296e", "created": 1631739721, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmPZALyVGj7AiH3AmjprTbYEMEw7SNShMXvwo4adMgmfWv", "voter": "0x32B9f064cC3c219a61d875e26565cDCe5859E0e9", "created": 1631736173, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQpvjzwy5o4G8KB9oFYmTbPHL59cNySAwtsad9RALD5DR", "voter": "0x465623b2cE74e0eB844C382D76a900C32566c46B", "created": 1631724144, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmdrSp9Ti88mT4PLwQKdEWxEk2oECxAALrep3F2jRVReam", "voter": "0x4BD49374BcbE3704c7b482173049B1002eed3B2E", "created": 1631705924, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qmb7xZKTCmExAaq3PUGHs6a9XQUQRA1mCanHRNb4KpxQTo", "voter": "0xeA8c97dCB93C9863Db644c903971E85EA0AC1637", "created": 1631698818, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmTTFU1G2BGysPwMm3dnrQuEDbtSmynm1oV7oRjhzcjqjs", "voter": "0x728ed1A7720622Ff0DD0C62059b61952E8a7A4C0", "created": 1631687813, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmXgmHWxk7KSRCDMquvxTr7XifHQ5Vi5rqZ2a1YguhNYx2", "voter": "0xDcE62b21A8B1A9b39dD3ded27C876d416CC91B3e", "created": 1631683849, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQuSZxTN3aLf7qmvtje3Fwj2u1zaKhGueQMJoAaPKTNo2", "voter": "0x31511864b8F12dB58CEa114bc33398C53aa5A4df", "created": 1631679705, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmR8Q8QCwp1SAfaHR48q3HJ5URV4Eoq85D2nN323Efswtt", "voter": "0xDFE7ad3E0cc6fb0798e66C67C72927C49fc42478", "created": 1631653909, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmYgHukeq3w5idhh3QvH9wwYpNfmzK1b4SkG2vPzW9EFc3", "voter": "0xb12C82C54bf47Bac05580A75FE3dda4bd33978c7", "created": 1631646596, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmWxiRUkHLJa59dtBDaqA5fJUpwoWtWbPqmhLRKpER2v8K", "voter": "0xf17441352d36a537c36dB7782B7f08651fbBD86F", "created": 1631626774, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmVieL3NGtMM23spwzm5LBrdzEWGWoFmsvq9TqfYxtmNXR", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1631583429, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qmekb2KeaAiU9AkwXMmSfaaCbqbWhE1cF16cxrBnrbF1sQ", "voter": "0x532f2be5392C5094DD89893c20AeEa3B9a3F2DB6", "created": 1631549643, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmP32sAuL5QGEvXMw4AuWeTeuFFxvoHa86iXGaVLx6ATYc", "voter": "0x8552Aa9dB5BCAA56D41411a4800309d7D0D35E36", "created": 1631542984, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQ3kFYtcHDj3jRSTEYACQcL6mCRhJHTYwX5iDMgNhtGAi", "voter": "0x3c92fDACE3779D4241A1990b218cE8223779a090", "created": 1631525976, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
