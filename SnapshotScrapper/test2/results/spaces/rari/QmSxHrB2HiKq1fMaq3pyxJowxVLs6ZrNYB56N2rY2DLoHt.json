Therefore, we need to recognize that the attention span of newcomers will be very short, and their demand for immediate answers to their pressing questions will be strong.\n\nWe also need to recognize that building a consumer-facing mobile app will create a flood of users who know nothing about DeFi or crypto.\n\nThis creates a dilemma and an opportunity.\n\nThe Dilemma\n\nThe Rari team has a large pipeline of products to release this year. Answering repetitive questions on Discord and Twitter isn't an optimal use of their time, but ignoring those questions isn't a good strategy either.\n\nSo far the team has done a great job threading the needle on support. They created high level docs and FAQs on Notion, they do regular community calls, and give direct responses to users on Discord.\n\nHowever, direct response customer support doesn't scale well, and all the important content that newcomers are looking for is spread across multiple platforms. As the Rari community grows, it's important that all the knowledge being shared by the Rari team is accessible to anyone at any moment, whether it originally came from Discord, Notion, a YouTube interview, or somewhere else.\n\nIt is also important that all content is displayed in a familiar, user-friendly format directly on the Rari Capital site.\n\nThat's why I am proposing a more scalable solution to customer support. One that can:\n\n- Give every Rari newcomer the white glove support they deserve\n- Give the team time to focus on their high-priority pipeline of products\n- Improve visitor conversion rates and help onboard new capital to the Rari ecosystem\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nMy proposal is to create a real-time searchable library of everything Rari newcomers might want to know about. Inspired by Apple's support system (https://support.apple.com/), this site should be tightly integrated with the Rari app, and will precisely follow the existing Rari site design and format.\n\nIt will feature:\n\n- Thoughtful deep-dives on hundreds of the most commonly asked Discord/Twitter questions as the community asks them. Here is an example from Apple: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlp2265/mac\n- Full-length product guides. Here is an example from Apple: https://support.apple.com/airpods\n- All existing Rari videos, community calls, and external interviews in a user-friendly dashboard. Here is an example from Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/ca/browse/genre/839338\n- A dictionary of DeFi definitions to help newcomers navigate Rari and the entire Ethereum ecosystem. This will help Rari users and act as a public good benefiting everyone in the DeFi space.\n\nProject Plan\n\nI plan to work with the Rari Capital team to make sure all design and formatting meets their standards, and to make sure all content is up to date and in line with their tone/style. I plan to work closely with the Rari Capital community to prioritize the guide topics and blog posts to answer all of their most pressing questions.\n\nProject Timeline\n\nProject Development: 14 Days\n\nContent Creation: 30 Days\n\nI will be publishing new content every day for the first 30 days of project launch. I expect to write roughly 10,000-15,000 words of original content per month. After the first month of content, I will create another proposal with the results of the first 30 days, and the DAO can decide whether they want me to continue creating content, or have someone else take over the project.\n\nThe Rari DAO will own all IP and content related to the project either way.\n\nProject Cost\n\nDevelopment Cost: $5,000 USD\n\nContent Creation Cost: $5,000 USD/mo\n\nTotal Proposal Cost: $10,000 USD\n\nPayment to be made in $RGT, using the $RGT price as of the Snapshot vote completion.\n\n*A note on funding: In the forum discussion related to this proposal, the Rari team mentioned that the treasury only had $15k to spend on new projects. Since then, a proposal has passed to re-direct Loopring rewards ($1M+) back to the Rari treasury to help fund projects like this and others that are helping to build up the Rari ecosystem.\n\nLanding Page Mock-Up\n\nBelow is a rough sketch of what the main landing page could look like. Each section will need a slightly different page format with different functionalities (real-time search, tile design, etc...), but I welcome all feedback and ideas for improving the support library.\n\nhttps://rari-support-library.webflow.io/", "choices": ["Fund Rari Support Library", "Don't Fund Rari Support Library"], "start": 1618258500, "end": 1618431300, "snapshot": "12227342",
