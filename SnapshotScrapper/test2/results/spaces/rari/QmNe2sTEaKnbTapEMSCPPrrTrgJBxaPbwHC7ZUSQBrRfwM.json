{"id": "QmNe2sTEaKnbTapEMSCPPrrTrgJBxaPbwHC7ZUSQBrRfwM", "title": "Infrastructure Task Force Grant Request", "body": "Hello Rari Capital DAO, this is on behalf of the whole infrastructure task force,\n\nSummary: \n\nAs previously announced (https://medium.com/rari-capital/the-roadmap-for-various-rari-capital-task-forces-716039e841ee) and (https://medium.com/rari-capital/version-2-the-future-of-the-rari-capital-dao-9d2c37027752), the Rari Capital DAO has migrated to a task force structure. This means that there will be several and hopefully many teams building the Rari Capital protocol as well as applications/integrations on top of the protocol. The goal for this DAO mechanism is to provide a conducive working environment where everyone who wants to get involved in supporting the DAO and protocol has the opportunity to. It is important that we have task forces designed to build and maintain the infrastructure, as well as task forces down the road that create applications to further inject the power of the protocol into new environments.\n\nBackground: \n\nUp until this new model was announced publicly, the founding team has been incentivized through the initial batch of RGT and newer contributors have gone ahead and created governance proposals requesting RGT from the treasury. Now that the most recent token mint has been passed and executed (https://www.withtally.com/governance/rari/proposal/4) , It is important that we now start to utilize these resources in order to retain all of the amazing talent we have brought to this organization. Retaining competent developers and on-boarding new talent will be integral to our success in the hyper-growing DeFi ecosystem. The market for top tier DeFi developers is becoming increasingly competitive and we need to make sure the Rari Capital DAO and infrastructure task force remain competitive in this space.\n\nAbstract: \n\nThe infrastructure team is the backbone of the Rari Capital Protocol. The members on this team vary from developers to business development to community management. This team of people have been tasked with building the most robust open interest rate protocol, Fuse, and all of the strategy and business operations surrounding it.\n\nThe infrastructure team would like to request the following from the community controlled DAO treasury for the next quarter (October 15th, 2021 to January 15th, 2022) in order to sustain current and new contributors financially. As Rari\u2019s scope of product grows, we believe it is critical to build out the team across a few areas: UI/UX design, full-stack product engineering, DAO integrations, smart contracts engineering (solidity), and risk engineering (subgraph). This quarter we will be taking a very active approach to bringing on more full-time contributors.\n\nVesting Contract:\n100,000 RGT with (1, 4) vesting\n50,000 RGT [Fully liquid]\n\nMotivation: \n\nRari Capital has been live for over a year now, and it is clear that all of the contributors are committed for the long-term. We would like to be here forever and we need to ensure incentives are aligned between us and the community at large.\nHaving a strong relationship between the community and the contributors is the most important in an industry like this, and we urge everyone to share their thoughts and comments below to ensure that we all work together in crafting the best proposal possible. This will set a foundation and template for future task forces. Thank you.\n\nFor: Provide the infrastructure team with incentives mentioned above.\nAgainst: Do not do anything.", "choices": ["Provide the grant ", "Don't do anything "], "start": 1633735200, "end": 1633908000, "snapshot": "13381088", "state": "closed", "author": "0xe63aa29Be1a7303C72bF5D2F4526389597AD70C2", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 15, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmeqNADKBzpAX5SXQCEYhcawW4yjFqaJqPm9bh1rFunm3c", "voter": "0x424687a2BB8B34F93c3DcB5E3Cdd2AD6A21163Bf", "created": 1633893425, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmVAfBqGEKmoRrMPwgk1PcqzDCsBbXxBvCS1y5VbSBxdvQ", "voter": "0x7E8e66E8834F762077dEeC97F792d83092EBE431", "created": 1633893201, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmcnBmPBvzLuS4AdavRB5WTAUnGVAzXm1GtgSxuPYRrVoY", "voter": "0x28EFd202069c82E9DF0DacFFe1e7512d8E56BD2E", "created": 1633857146, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmSMeHF8u2m9514aLpNQjNLCEKXXhjHepk57FKcVFm3enn", "voter": "0x6a26afb01Ff57e827079658238858d55774cA2D5", "created": 1633829252, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmY5vMMVSdsvkKceooJ6RByzYqLAAX9gTLMuJ1TmC5n2uy", "voter": "0xfB953D5c69bB04461b74e13655072eaE8fB384Da", "created": 1633818409, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qmd7zXPaAyac9UpBYgisAZJDRWpyHgLPQTyzQhxC7id9Do", "voter": "0xf6b7Af3eaeD85198Ad9c49353485d17b54988e7A", "created": 1633817513, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qmbnnhh3n4U1yWyyPdixsLdSsgKctnSfiqE4ka3iWTarjE", "voter": "0x1ccb144B700EC726d37Db38c617E154De6d9c0d0", "created": 1633784120, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmXUawc7CgHzZqz8zqxPRJ56GjNnLTwmwosaDwJRb9zqP1", "voter": "0xA6116B8731874DE46e172602979113B10bF46E80", "created": 1633783441, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmchuZ9zWMob6nYcGoMYQ1DRdAtBzdL7FxkMuNMBdC29fr", "voter": "0x211a26A3fc01b01B217b76C391902e42E3e1eE91", "created": 1633763778, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmfV1CT5QHFJWkhffCBCWuFCuCve2PzjrAL2Q75y7dQ8gc", "voter": "0x7CfF2498f94DA769F182b13C1caBd7358Aa7dB53", "created": 1633755045, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qmees2b65juoULgWDRuDZPL3qh7TZAsjNqWYsCwgZMYhd1", "voter": "0x59777b48e2E182904026cf341904f31c2d773cD4", "created": 1633746731, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmSUwrLZoU8dxaTJpmJhygxXXPzHggz4ZbWp2WvLXGkCFU", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1633743209, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmaLkEq3SFyjXzL4ndvQ63SS2k1XAvskrvV2qUn4MK6v72", "voter": "0xD67E097A365AEdDC59aFbaDCADdaE9AD57552698", "created": 1633736968, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQKTpK27NpmVxHy7KYjkPmk4w476bXGBihnXz8vPb2zWB", "voter": "0x2733CAEc18289DF88827287A72CE6CAF0F785522", "created": 1633736628, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmbgsMXEypkn2vuwJWqEs1eDnGqacDmFmjZJjGrUJPZFqK", "voter": "0x084A8645b8E068b85196C6B0604B686CC92840Ca", "created": 1633736335, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
