We are proposing to be whitelisted as Fuse pool owners by the Rari Capital DAO as part of the safeguarded launch process.\n\nWe're requesting to be allowed to deploy Fuse Pools and manage the current pool created by Samuel (who is already whitelisted) in order to create lending and borrowing pools for the assets that power our reactors.\n\nIf this vote passes successfully, we will begin the migration process from Samuel as the pool owner to the Tokemak community, providing us the flexibility to evolve this pool and all future pools.\n\nWe would look to roll out Fuse pools/modify the current Fuse pool over multiple phases.\nPhase 1: TOKE/USDC/DAI/FEI/FRAX\nPhase 2: TOKE/tTOKE/tUSDC/tWETH/tUniLP/tSushiLP/USDC/DAI/FEI/FRAX\nHaving a Fuse pool is the first stage of a long-term collaboration between both communities and we are very excited to begin our relationship here by providing a place to lend and borrow TOKE assets. This will soon evolve into a relationship that uses Fuse pools more explicitly for token reactors (to be announced soon). Excited for all that is to come!\n\n", "choices": ["Approve Tokemak as pool owner", "Decline Tokemak as pool owner"], "start": 1630357200, "end": 1630530000, "snapshot": "13123314", "state": "closed", "author": "0xdb0919eB2662A570d327C84a09aCC50215b372bE", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 14, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmehLWhSwhvS26JVrggmTc9BEMWVHqTNQKc1XnKLbYY82s", "voter": "0x68BB5a6D14CACEaB866037b1502565f5BbA17506", "created": 1630523072, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmfYi1tDhoLHfRhRjD2DAVuFg75GS1xVzc8WtsL5fWDPAE", "voter": "0x7c1645b5a844D73b7dba7b5Ab4d3DE55e79BEd93", "created": 1630513936, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmWw2tUhNnKJC8pojztrqJw2wDt3R5ZvMZyDThqaMSw83v", "voter": "0x97b90FBc8904F861F76CB06BFa0A465b72C5E662", "created": 1630513344, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmaAr5947mxGB7K47kbst6s9b4nsa9uoRr6C9drJbW6wqv", "voter": "0x4BD49374BcbE3704c7b482173049B1002eed3B2E", "created": 1630497060, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmUJbvmFMypRbchSEU2DnDbackgGJeMzSWWKBNrpT3T9m9", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1630478530, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmXEVNBmU945E9YVNZMEKymSqjCRq6W3H8MCkMKdtVCsth", "voter": "0xDFE7ad3E0cc6fb0798e66C67C72927C49fc42478", "created": 1630463549, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmRbWM4rsfv114x7Zu2AHnkVLbmA7gPDkBKV3bYmZojJCK", "voter": "0x128e5625e15FdBA91d6CcB1AbDFdC62b5d152b4f", "created": 1630443177, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmX3qbypTzmwGq7E43aDJrbq8di4nQdyZapzpTBTQoTp9a", "voter": "0xc8484D4A6BaAaA7C31f411b1362145dA109F9B50", "created": 1630430018, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQ6C2TZzu47or4qh9df5rTUSbY5FjEu5zNbiVzYSuvvxC", "voter": "0x1d8eAe1014Bf33357E7a10B4428D57cFeD07ddf8", "created": 1630428561, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmWW7vPsyKStCFv6k5UUyAFoiM3SL6QG3aTyUWE7BaMKqc", "voter": "0x3cc5Ae073B32b777855D33Cb074A3056B3651697", "created": 1630428255, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmfPowtTar1qL2eWZY4qhDcjErgh1U3uPKrCssMaHEWBM1", "voter": "0x532f2be5392C5094DD89893c20AeEa3B9a3F2DB6", "created": 1630426343, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmTxBLi6zBMGusjPiWv7an426qkpu2cMMeVxnjoeBzdM1b", "voter": "0x6a26afb01Ff57e827079658238858d55774cA2D5", "created": 1630423626, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmYHJXNHPQsqmGeiri142QnQoh9BtRFeSqr1KoKxXBzVvP", "voter": "0x79afbd4B5606EFaB1ea25315734E035D92328be7", "created": 1630419346, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmS3HynoBjv6jGv1xZ9bQE4aJdEBzoUVE4rbvchEkWSmJW", "voter": "0x58C6cD2b53d41d06bfB7D33624D2835C011E61BE", "created": 1630376642, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
