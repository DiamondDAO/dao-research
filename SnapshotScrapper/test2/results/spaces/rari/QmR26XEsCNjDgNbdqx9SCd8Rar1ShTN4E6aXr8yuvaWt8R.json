{"id": "QmR26XEsCNjDgNbdqx9SCd8Rar1ShTN4E6aXr8yuvaWt8R", "title": "[RIP-3] New Fee Structure", "body": "Summary:\nThis proposal aims to revise the current fees to optimize for our performance and introduce a new fee structure to optimize for maximum developer and protocol retention. \n\nBackground:\nThe Rari Protocol is optimizing for the wrong things, in this case, withdrawals. Additionally, it doesn\u2019t allocate earnings properly. Lastly, it doesn\u2019t set us up for long-term success. For reference, Yearn (a similar yield aggregator) charges fees on a 2/20 basis. \n\nAbstract:\nThis proposal aims to solve the aforementioned issues. \n\nOld fees: \nStable Pool: 9.5% profits + 0.5% withdrawal\nYield Pool: 9.5% profits + 0.5% withdrawal \nETH Pool: 9.5% profits \n\nProposed fees:\nStable Pool: 17.5% profits\nYield Pool: 12.5% profits + time-based withdrawal \nWithdrawal fee: 2% at 0 hours \u2192 1% at 1 week \u2192 0.5% at 1 month \u2192 0% after another month\nThe withdrawal fee is required to prevent arbitrage within this pool since it is composed of various stablecoins which may have minor price fluctuations \nETH Pool: 17.5% of profits \n\nThis removes the withdrawal fee from the stable pool, further aligning us with our users. The reason for the increase in fees across the board is to offset the lost earnings from a withdrawal fee. Additionally, even with these numbers it places us in a competitive state to similar yield aggregation products. \n\nAs mentioned, I believe that we are not allocating earnings properly. Below, I propose a new plan for how we should be allocating them: \n\nOld fee structure:\n50% Rari charity\n50% Buyback and burn\n\nProposed fee structure:\n45% Smart treasury (if RIP-5 is passed (or a derivative of it), if not, community treasury)\n15% Community treasury\n33.33% Developer who created strategy\nFee share is halved each $1m earned (taking value of fees at the time of payment) until fee share equals 8.16%. The remainder is forwarded to the Community Treasury. \n6.66% Staking (if RIP-4 is passed (or a derivative of it), if not, to the developer)\n\nIf RIP-4 or RIP-5 or a derivative of it are later added, they will be implemented into the fees as part of this proposal. \n\nMotivation:\nThe smart treasury serves a similar function as the buyback and burn with the major difference being that it accrues value for the ecosystem instead of offering a useless burn. Furthermore, I introduce a new method that will enable stakers to earn a piece of the fees. This is outlined in the Staking Mechanism proposal (RIP-4). This will ensure protocol retention amongst our users. \n\nMost importantly, there is a large portion being given to the developer who creates the strategy as this will help attract the best talent into the protocol, as we are rewarding them the best compensation. This will create a strong ecosystem around the Rari Protocol that can be later monetized with RIP-6 and the Incubation program. \n\nThis sets us up for long term success by deploying capital efficiently and ensuring we attract the best developers to our side.
