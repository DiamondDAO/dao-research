There is lots of room for creativity in pool creation. Various synthetics and derivatives can be listed, oracles and time periods can be modified, and pools can be marketed in interesting ways.\n\n### Motivation\nAllowing individual users to experiment fast without requiring DAO approval for each listing will enable Rari to identify product-market fit faster and gauge what kinds of listing are beneficial.\n\nThe current approach has been to establish contact with teams of projects whose tokens are to be listed, this however slows down the pace at which listing occurs. Not all projects have the attention span required to undertake pool creation with us. It is therefore a more scalable model for Rari to undertake this pool creation and then later on involve the project teams if the pools do indeed take off.
