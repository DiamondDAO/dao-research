Tech stack used across our team is wide and and growing, and includes but is not limited to:\n\nRuby\nRails (and associated technologies)\nJavascript\nPython\nTypescript\nReact\nExpress\nMongo DB\nPostgres\nUI/UX\n(There are also team members learning, but not yet fluent, in Solidity.)\n\nOur motivation for getting involved in this project is to help the community, but also to gain first hand knowledge of how a DAO operates and specifically understand Rari, with the goal of becoming partners, growing the project and getting it adopted in our part of the world. There is no better way to do this than taking a deep dive and getting our hands dirty.\n\nPrototype\nPlease view here our prototypes/samples we created by following these links:\n\n1. A dark themed design:\nhttps://bit.ly/2SLeNE2\n\n2. Same as above with different color scheme:\nhttps://bit.ly/3cSwqZs\n\n3. Material design:\nhttps://bit.ly/3vBrnmL\n\nThese are just rough, preliminary samples. The finished work will be more polished and will include popups that appear on user interaction and other information (eg usdc balance, yield earned) specific and relevant to user. Community input is welcome and will be sought during development.\n\nHosting\nAs per project specification: decentralized hosting using Fleek/IFPS\n\nProject Completion\n21 days from formal approval (+/- 7 days).\nOur work will be hosted on Github and progress may be tracked by community members.\n\nPayment\n$4000 (US) in total. $3500 in USDC and $500 in RGT\nPayment to be made within 3 days of completion of project after audit by Rari Team.\n\nExcited to do this and hope our proposal passes.\n\n", "choices": ["Approve", "Do not Approve"], "start": 1624197600, "end": 1624370400, "snapshot": "12671331", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7e6c513eA08415Ffb179f37Aa72d5bAD87095f01", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmeTSgwfq8opmsyDwWyeaRAmHt9vP2JDCmxe1BefmEUN9V", "voter": "0x227FD2fD881Cc6c99DFCcc0FB40f2B1dc2f3F36E", "created": 1624341974, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmajJQQ3z5emFZTWmiVL5bkdTZKYTFSnDiYoejQiJ8SJFj", "voter": "0x4BD49374BcbE3704c7b482173049B1002eed3B2E", "created": 1624274640, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmVFyvtRTVdHB64BuZeDZ3XN8a2nMb7kmhHBYHTtmabvPm", "voter": "0x32B9f064cC3c219a61d875e26565cDCe5859E0e9", "created": 1624257877, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
