Since the exploit on May 8th, we have adjusted our security standards such as: removing external integrations, retainer program with Quantstamp, and exploring insurance mechanisms. I believe strongly in insuring Smart Contracts, and after a long conversation with the Nexus Mutual team, I am confident in this potential partnership.\n\nAbstract\nThe protocol already has an insurance mechanism on Cover, but there are no rewards, making it very unappealing to users. From anecdotal evidence, it is very clear that our community and protocol wants insurance, and Nexus Mutual can support us.\n\nIf this proposal passes successfully, we will work with the Nexus Mutual team to create and deploy a shield mining program for coverage on their platform.\n\nMotivation\nHow Nexus Mutual Coverage and Shield Mining works.\n\nOn top of risk assessors earning NXM for staking on Rari Capital smart contract coverage, they can earn $RGT through the proposed shield mining program. To incentivize our shield mining program I propose we allocate up to 5,000 $RGT tokens. The goal is to optimize for a reward rate of 2.5% (0.05 RGT/NXM staked), which at 100k NXM staked would yield about 12 weeks of campaign length if we were to distribute 5,000 $RGT. The 2.5% is on a weekly basis, so would be 100% annualized for protection against the Rari Capital Protocol.\n\nFor: Engage in Shield Mining using RGT\nAgainst: Don't do anything", "choices": ["Engage in Shield Mining using RG", "Don't do anything"], "start": 1633547580, "end": 1633720380, "snapshot": "13367199", "state": "closed", "author": "0xe63aa29Be1a7303C72bF5D2F4526389597AD70C2", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTZMau8TkWRgccFr8dCxvEUzQGJ53MVmzpFLVi3BgVqn7", "voter": "0x97b90FBc8904F861F76CB06BFa0A465b72C5E662", "created": 1633702766, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qmcu9k17DnjBqRAFTzJkQVUcf3ZxAnR9vHxurHPiZYY16B", "voter": "0xB92197BCf7793a69291740723F19CFbD152E91F5", "created": 1633632987, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qmerokgs4AweRGu569hEFT3kKvF6m54sbUJSGxn1J11R1J", "voter": "0x6a26afb01Ff57e827079658238858d55774cA2D5", "created": 1633614022, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmRp1z6tnSFf8FimeRhh5L1LpT88KaGf5yh63uTCxDs68o", "voter": "0x211a26A3fc01b01B217b76C391902e42E3e1eE91", "created": 1633592931, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmQzjV5YMqqQSoem49gCCgRLXfGbmrF6wmnvXDvDvXbXMw", "voter": "0xDcE62b21A8B1A9b39dD3ded27C876d416CC91B3e", "created": 1633587344, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmTSyXhPKgyzDb37Y1LrUC6XSWxF6hiXJ7yytfEUuPLEys", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1633580802, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmU2gabkbwYNYcP8VqGznsH4ZReZFzzkcEn2hGd7UM8y7v", "voter": "0x128e5625e15FdBA91d6CcB1AbDFdC62b5d152b4f", "created": 1633574184, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmT4TgEDUT3LgVPLAaQ8vrUx2nxvotKnoTjrv3gBdxBHSb", "voter": "0xCB33844b365c53D3462271cEe9B719B6Fc8bA06A", "created": 1633562569, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmZ2uQjyzq55qX9XnGyGPtf3dGznpaQUHYg2QTz3NtNXch", "voter": "0x58C6cD2b53d41d06bfB7D33624D2835C011E61BE", "created": 1633549164, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
