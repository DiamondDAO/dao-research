It can cause some problems, that will lead to improper liquidations. For example let's say uni swap has $1 mil of liquidity for some asset, and we have $1.5 mil of assets in the Fuse pool\n\nAbstract : I have implemented a mapping, that stores the Max Asset Cap for each asset. A fuse Pool admin or Asset Cap Guardian can set up this value.\n\nMotivation : A Maximum asset cap would help to fix the maximum amount of asset that can be deposited in the Fuse Pool. It will prevent improper liquidiations for every asset deposited in the Fuse Pool\n\nSolution Proposed : https://github.com/Rari-Capital/compound-protocol/pull/1\n\nI am Aditya Dhir, a computer Science and Engineering Student. Currently working as Blockchain developer at leading startup.\n\nI would like to request the payment of USD 2000 once the Code is reviewed. Currently I have implemented the functionality for the Max Asset Cap.", "choices": ["yes", "No"], "start": 1623886200, "end": 1624084200, "snapshot": "12649836", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5897e285f36da748c51574Ee6C1ffa629A53Ca48", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNtDAjBNC9YwvcjS7vKkdwErj6gQFjwdJxFj2xhmzrLeq", "voter": "0x32B9f064cC3c219a61d875e26565cDCe5859E0e9", "created": 1624081666, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmY4NT4ffydaKJQG2tmD93J5eDebPGwodMcyxvNB95ixhe", "voter": "0xDcE62b21A8B1A9b39dD3ded27C876d416CC91B3e", "created": 1624079849, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmXLcDwcSKwhdx1dqc2UVcYC38T1NrnvNGFuts5TJMWvrU", "voter": "0x666eeDF593D66a3dF42A484C0D337e2E484bAA9A", "created": 1624070614, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmbGGc6vuEnWJ7BqyXEsKT1dd56ioLQCXpNP97rJUqrMe3", "voter": "0xd61daEBC28274d1feaAf51F11179cd264e4105fB", "created": 1624067699, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qme6RJ8ZiJyw84hHibyrpz4MM5gEyJLRB9wPtLQUdij1eJ", "voter": "0xa8ed55b88Ea3643230Fb24B560B9235F7551f727", "created": 1624008500, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmPgf244mxYn4G8MmZhEST135r5rRCjmctzS2LSBiGMe1V", "voter": "0xcbc7d0Ff51D37b60ba741bF566496BBa53b5eea2", "created": 1623999191, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
