This resulted in the creation of [Fuse Pool #24, Harvest FARMstead](https://app.rari.capital/fuse/pool/24).\n\nHarvest FARMstead has quickly grown to be the 6th-largest pool on Fuse.  This growth has been accelerated by [bootstrapping incentives provided by Harvest to USDC depositors](https://harvest.finance) and a Harvest community member's creation and deployment of an innovative [new stablecoin interest rate model](https://etherscan.io/address/0xab0f8Cd18E875AF7F2718B394Ccd1a5a0643D8a9) (and [associated PR](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/rari-dApp/pull/447) to support IRMs with adjustable parameters).\n\nHarvest would like to show appreciation to RGT holders by providing access to stablecoin borrowing enabled by Harvest's deposit bootstrapping and the new IRM.  In exchange, Harvest requests a reduction in the Pool #24 platform fee from the 10% to a partnership discount of 7%.  Increased pool usage and collaboration on further Fuse improvements will more than make up for this fee decrease.\n\n[See the discussion in the forum \u2192](https://forums.rari.capital/d/142-add-rgt-to-pool-24-reduce-pool-24-platform-fee)\n\n## Vote Details\n\nFOR: Add RGT as collateral in Pool #24 @ 60% LTV and reduce the Fuse platform fee in Pool #24 from 10% to 7%\n\nAGAINST: do nothing", "choices": ["add RGT + reduce platform fee", "do nothing"], "start": 1629561600, "end": 1629763200, "snapshot": "13069420", "state": "closed", "author": "0xbC3C4486B9b6cCd4e07422D626e4052B0A8055Ac", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTTHvq28hGJxc3qcXGuya6SaJfHsQ1u3LytdWcLmGkVf5", "voter": "0xC6142e98b9187A9F18B171e0f2463A2e581FF8cA", "created": 1629761825, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmUh44fn8CUeXE94gm2NAPcxCPkoMcysqwYEv5vkuoy1aD", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1629752361, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmaJ4qs5XvMdAF8Sbw8apwUjE8Dx5JCcDvhTZNEr6JQLB6", "voter": "0xDFE7ad3E0cc6fb0798e66C67C72927C49fc42478", "created": 1629738880, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmdBoRirU4JR9jRNcAeLMpTKxJz29fm7SJGmgJUoCLtnv1", "voter": "0xf286E07ED6889658A3285C05C4f736963cF41456", "created": 1629735402, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmexbkvDMnuFLrui1RD3XcTFMPHrCmXyGihY74mff8bq9k", "voter": "0x0A745c9207eEBa13294f34161FAff9968fCf7a61", "created": 1629725881, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmRqGSrftT6QogqUWdmn3uh8XPePKc5bCKnfDLFLYJcsZg", "voter": "0x128e5625e15FdBA91d6CcB1AbDFdC62b5d152b4f", "created": 1629641137, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmXnA6MYBhKuccdTz7oegBQY3sGqdCzPe6k1ea2zrGbmB5", "voter": "0xC45d45b54045074Ed12d1Fe127f714f8aCE46f8c", "created": 1629615394, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qmd8EZpwW5rfmvkbTpARhnBC9cK9asw4N4rvvcS8HXokPk", "voter": "0x13005adbFfee7a43b21c5027aeec2AB115Df9a85", "created": 1629587204, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmXxye2AxpdKYGqDLhRMdzbwZXUfEjW5MuGp33ii8k1vDe", "voter": "0xEF34E52ee7F94B10A64d8B23dC69C1aEf92306D2", "created": 1629562960, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
