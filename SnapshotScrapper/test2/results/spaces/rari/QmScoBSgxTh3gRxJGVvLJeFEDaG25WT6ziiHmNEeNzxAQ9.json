{"id": "QmScoBSgxTh3gRxJGVvLJeFEDaG25WT6ziiHmNEeNzxAQ9", "title": "[Concept and Implementation Grant] Consulting - Samuel", "body": "### Summary\nApprove 800 RGT grant for 2 months of consulting and managing of risk, grants, pool creation and integrations for Rari\n\n### Background\nI worked for Rari on a trial basis for 2 weeks, this was successful. During that time I built a comprehensive risk framework for Fuse pools - including backtesting and future-looking estimation. [Implementation is underway and docs will be out soon.]\n\n### Abstract\nI would like to continue this collaboration and work on the following deliverables:\n\nContinue handling Fuse Risk framework - especially in light of layer 2 (new dexes, new oracles with different attack surface and latency). Document the same.\nManage grants - establish Grants Station - a governance framework and workflow for grants. Actively seek new onboards and act as communication bridge. (KPI: Number of grants)\nPool creation - innovate and create new exotic pools for Rari (KPI: Number of pools, TVL)\n(possible) Integrations - explore integrations with other projects, such as a potential one with Pendle (KPI: Number of integrations, TVL)\n(possible) Fuse 2.0 - explore a redesign of the lending model from first principles to maximise capital efficiency and user benefit on L2.\nConsulting on all other matters - tokenomics, UX and so forth\nI would like to be paid 800 RGT for the 2 month duration 18 May to 18 July 2021. Accepting RGT denomination and only at the end of this period ensures I'm incentive-aligned with Rari and will work to improve the protocol and RGT price.\n\nI have backdated this proposal to 18 May as an exception, however, going forward I would like to establish a precedent of getting work approved before it is officially worked on.\n\n### Motivation\nRisk framework - Fuse is planning to open up permissionless listing for assets. This however requires responsible disclosure of risks to lenders, borrowers and yield farmers. Assets can be volatile, illiquid or contain systemic risks - all need to be handled. Layer 2 will also open up new attack surfaces that need to be dealt with.\nManage grants - Largely elucidated in my Grant Station post\nPool creation - Largely elucidated in my post making me trusted partner for pool creation\nIntegrations - Essential to onboard new communities and create synergistic relationships with other projects beyond just token listings. Integrations will provide value-add services for Fuse users, and draw in TVL.\nFuse 2.0 - Most lending pools in use today are forks or minor variations of the Compound Finance model launched way back in 2017. Rebuilding a lending model from scratch could help overcome its limitations. A focus on the design space for L2 must be maintained.", "choices": ["Approve 800 RGT grant", "Do not approve"], "start": 1622921400, "end": 1623094200, "snapshot": "12576318", "state": "closed", "author": "0x552C35f51A52fa1bF1CA481A9a57D464474248D2", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXYq6hwNiaKPKS1nEPnWVKLowsQxH7prsAefVP9cQ4f9M", "voter": "0xf9c18F2D1EA93e9A36507F238CFFc6f0Ad7D6eb3", "created": 1623091554, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmdjvtL2awsDTpRd7tdxiRCWa2TNrU8e3XFbt88Rh7w6Su", "voter": "0x47aC710D34935ac3b3BDB73bD0354eE63AAE1cd1", "created": 1623091543, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmaHbsTuKphBx1ZYkk2nfYFA32vA85yWuWj5ytWJSpLv1n", "voter": "0xfd2bF23a646227431Bc935897cA3285ad2a5c82A", "created": 1623086230, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmXC98KpHLMFA6S6xyhD77rrZnuyZhDZxmJwzPLWdUR3Lt", "voter": "0x128e5625e15FdBA91d6CcB1AbDFdC62b5d152b4f", "created": 1623074436, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmZgvxtypMmPc9Pboqb3J3RKEDv5YNpUZGUajzSFGG93cW", "voter": "0xa7c64f0989dB5a7a53a2ba57Ae876f13D3a1De0c", "created": 1623040075, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmVdbQDcLnFSDNPzS9ag41Q2RJDSzceU66XGU3jnvbwU7y", "voter": "0xc67BC45773C0c09f64a03176864f12fe468bc7EB", "created": 1622989762, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "Qmbb8k9rY38QPnsmxST8orJCpEnLW6rM5xTKd7NhFmW8Vw", "voter": "0x79afbd4B5606EFaB1ea25315734E035D92328be7", "created": 1622989735, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmeD9SbzgDgkmmLAbwAPXRvcag8fX4cAzJmJPna1fukkK3", "voter": "0xA82fCEFd303Fa68864b787a5f118b09cE5A4c93d", "created": 1622982888, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmNdhL6K2xenJwRfbadr1KAqnvbhGFCHkz7vjUK3qQsaW7", "voter": "0xC06d3307080622d51CE3a5444B0d427dCaaFD7b3", "created": 1622971322, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmPL76vdjdmTNJxY2UA2JP9MVrti8M5ZSSXYmcrKrHVPzy", "voter": "0x33FF74323dF522E44c519B4a9d305A7639f7Cf4f", "created": 1622948927, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmUddoBcyGxqRTdh7PK8J668xx8wHZ6znHRcDu8ZarPcyE", "voter": "0x48b576c87e788a762D6f95A456f2A39113b46950", "created": 1622942106, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
