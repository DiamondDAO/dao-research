Tech stack used across our team is wide and and growing, and includes but is not limited to:\n\nRuby\nRails and associated technologies\nJavascript\nTypescript\nPython\nReact\nExpress\nMongo DB\nPostgres\nUI/UX\nMotivation\nWe have already submitted a proposal for Self-made frontend which is receiving favourable attention and has been posted to snapshot.\n(https://vote.rari.capital/#/rari/proposal/QmSdXkzoNadzNBbhmgoizLRW5EA7CUNyF8eDy2TqwihPpj )\nPlease follow the link  to vote.\n\nIt seems logical to build a mobile version as well. This will involve modifications of our original frontend design to suit small and large mobile devices as well as tablets .\n\nOur approach accrues advantages to both users and the project in general.\nFor users, it creates a seamless experience when design and functionality are similar across devices. For the project, it keeps the brand identity unified across media, reduces the learning curve, and promotes engagement. Also, reusing components will reduce app production time. Lastly, the number of production technologies (and possibility of things going wrong that take time to fix) is also reduced.\n\nPrototype\nPlease view here our prototypes/samples we created by following these links:\n\n1. A dark themed design:\nhttps://bit.ly/2SLeNE2\n\n2. Same as above with different color scheme:\nhttps://bit.ly/3cSwqZs\n\n3. Material design:\nhttps://bit.ly/3vBrnmL\n\nThese are just rough, preliminary samples. The finished work will be more polished and will include popups that appear on user interaction and other information (eg usdc balance, yield earned) specific and relevant to user. Design will be extensively modified to work on mobile devices and tablets.\nCommunity input is welcome and will be sought during development.\n\nHosting\nAs per project specification: decentralized hosting using Fleek/IFPS\n\nProject Completion\n21 days from formal approval (+/- 7 days).\nOur work will be hosted on Github and progress may be tracked by community members.\n\nPayment\n$4000 (US) in total. $3500 in USDC and $500 in RGT\nPayment to be made within 3 days of completion of project after audit by Rari Team.\n\nExcited to do this and hope our proposal passes.", "choices": ["I Approve", "I Do Not Approve"], "start": 1624197600, "end": 1624370400, "snapshot": "12671515", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7e6c513eA08415Ffb179f37Aa72d5bAD87095f01", "space": {"id": "rari", "name": "Rari Capital"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmaN5RqtJtid1WiuqNEZ9L2woptfEq1U45f9fCi1sP93u2", "voter": "0x227FD2fD881Cc6c99DFCcc0FB40f2B1dc2f3F36E", "created": 1624341930, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "rari"}}, {"id": "QmbYGGygo5G4BsGU1Wb758oFCGfNjhEMefwRaBxvsNGxt8", "voter": "0x32B9f064cC3c219a61d875e26565cDCe5859E0e9", "created": 1624257859, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "rari"}}]}
