Currently the majority of the tokens are reserved for future incentives/development work as well as held by the team. Therefore the circulating supply is currently on the low end with a rough estimate of 15-20% of the total supply. As more tokens are brought into circulation, the unit price would naturally decline if demand were to remain stable. However, the case for demand to remain stable is weak considering Blockade Games' Flagship title is due to release in stages starting in the Fall of 2020. This game has been highly anticipated for years and will finally reach players' hands which will bring traffic to the community and coin_artist's E-Den. Additionally, the prospect of liquidity mining for and with $COIN could indeed bring about additional demand within the broader context of rising DeFi interest.\n\nWith these current and potential market forces in mind, what do you think the price of $COIN will be at the start of the New Year?", "choices": ["<$0.50", ">=$0.50, <$1.00", ">=$1.00, <$2.00", ">=$2.00, <$4.00", ">=$4.00, <$8.00", ">$8.00"], "start": 1599480000, "end": 1599566400, "snapshot": "10821186", "state": "closed", "author": "0x63Bc9fdC6b27e0C67A1d0478f9C4d36Bc08a8C39", "space": {"id": "coin", "name": "Coin Artist"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
