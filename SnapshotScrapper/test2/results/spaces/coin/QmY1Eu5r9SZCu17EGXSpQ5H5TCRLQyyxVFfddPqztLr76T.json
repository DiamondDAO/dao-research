{"id": "QmY1Eu5r9SZCu17EGXSpQ5H5TCRLQyyxVFfddPqztLr76T", "title": "Cyberpunk 3D Puzzle Proposal", "body": "Proposal:\n\nThis DAO proposal is to design and publish a 3D cryptopuzzle artwork that contains $COIN as a discoverable prize. \n\nThe puzzle will feature 3D cyberpunk architecture inspired by the original in-game environments of Unity City and Neon District. A series of complex visual clues will be hidden within the design that ultimately lead to a wallet containing $COIN (among other possible easter eggs). This project is, of course, very much inspired by the first $COIN puzzle. My hope is that this becomes one of many artist contributions to the COIN ecosystem and adds to the value of COIN as a brand dedicated to exploring new modes of creative collaboration and community engagement.\n\nOnce complete, the puzzle will be published through an NFT art platform (example; SuperRare or OpenSea). Since the end-product here is an NFT artwork, my goals are to create something beautiful, viral, collectible and of course ~ eventually ~ solvable.\n\nEstimated time to produce: 2 weeks (from approval date)\n\nAbout Me: \n\nMy name is Kirk (pseudonym: untitled, xyz) I\u2019m an architect and urban designer. I first began my fall down the blockchain rabbit hole in 2014 while in graduate school for a masters in architecture and urban design at Columbia University. In 2017, I left my architecture job to start a crypto-themed design studio called Sndbox alongside a friend from architecture school. Together, we worked on dozens of creative projects including Neon District under the umbrella of Blockade Games. Last year I worked within the Neon District design team to develop graphics and early iterations of the user interface. I was inspired by the dystopian world-building and architectural concepts embedded in Unity City and have been itching to dive in and do something of a \u2018fan art\u2019 project to celebrate the District in 3D. Just this past month, I launched my own design practice called \u201cuntitled, xyz\u201d with the hopes of building experimental meta-architecture (few understand.) The start of this DAO feels particularly timely and I hope that this proposal resonates with your image of what the world of $COIN can explore.\n\nPuzzle Prize:\n\n100% of the $COIN proposed (below) will become the puzzle prize.\n\nMy initial draft proposal included a $COIN bounty to complete the puzzle work itself (the design iterations and rendering could take anywhere from 60-80 hours) but then I figured that it might be worth leveraging the brand network to draw in outside value while this ecosystem is still relatively new. Since 100% of the $COIN requested will go to the puzzle prize (not me) I ask that the $COIN network (coin_artist and others) help me share the NFT artwork once it\u2019s published. This visibility on its own is valuable. Your support also helps the artwork find a good collector, and for the $COIN treasure - a sound steward to join the E-Den.\n\nThis should make for an interesting experiment and I hope that I can count on your support to pass this proposal. For questions or art references please feel free to explore my SuperRare profile (https://superrare.co/untitledxyz_), ask me directly (Discord / Twitter [at] untitledxyz_), or ask any of the Blockade Games team members for their honest feedback on my design ability.
