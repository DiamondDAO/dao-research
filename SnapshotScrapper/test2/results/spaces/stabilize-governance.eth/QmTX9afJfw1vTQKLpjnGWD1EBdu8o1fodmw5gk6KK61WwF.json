{"id": "QmTX9afJfw1vTQKLpjnGWD1EBdu8o1fodmw5gk6KK61WwF", "title": "Should we introduce emission halvings", "body": "We are currently at ~460K STBZ circulation supply. It is planned to reduce the weekly emission which is currently 16,875 STBZ per week to only 1% annually after the total supply of 1mio STBZ is reached. This would result in a sharp drop from 16,875 to only 192.3 STBZ per week after the max supply is reached.\n\nIt is therefore suggested to 1) introduce an emission halving, similar to BTC or other POW protocols; or 2) introduce an emission reduction by 75% in combination with an early transaction burn. Both options aim to stretch out the emission and make the transition into the transaction burn phase more smooth.\n\n1)\nAs a first option, it is suggested to half the emission whenever half of the remaining emissions are depleted since the prior halving. After the halving results in a lower weekly emission than 192.3 STBZ (1% annually), the halving should stop and the transaction burn introduced after 1mio total supply is reached.\n\nThis would result in the following emission halving schedule:\n\n1)When 500K STBZ are circulating, weekly em. reduced to 16,875/2 = 8,437.5 STBZ\n2)When 750K STBZ are circulating, weekly em. reduced to 8,437.5/2 = 4,218.75 STBZ\n3)When 875K STBZ are circulating, weekly em. reduced to 4,218.75/2 = 2,109,375 STBZ\n4)When 937,5K STBZ are circulating, weekly em. reduced to 2,109,375/2 = 1,054.6875 STBZ\n5)When 969,75K STBZ are circulating, weekly em. reduced to 1,054.6875/2 = 527.3 STBZ\n6)When 984,875K STBZ are circulating, weekly em. reduced to 527.3/2 = 263,65 STBZ\n\nEach halving periode would last 29,6 Weeks, except the last which would last 57,4 weeks.\nFrom the time where 500K STBZ have been emitted, the emissions would therefore last ~205weeks, or ~4 years until the transaction burn phase would be initiated.\n\n2)\nAs an alternative option, an emission reduction to 75% of the earlier emitted amount is suggested whenever half of the remaining emissions are depleted since the prior reduction.\n\nThis would result in the following emission halving schedule:\n\n1)When 500K STBZ are circulating, weekly em. reduced to 16,875x0,75 = 12,656.25 STBZ\n2)When ~750K STBZ are circulating, weekly em. reduced to 12,656,25x0,75 = 9,492.1875 STBZ\n3)When ~875K STBZ are circulating, weekly em. reduced to 9,492.1875x0,75 = 7,119.14 STBZ\n4)When ~937,5K STBZ are circulating, weekly em. reduced to 7,119.14x0,75 = 5,339,3555 STBZ\n5)When ~969,75K STBZ are circulating, weekly em. reduced to 5,339,3555x0,75 =4.004,5166STBZ\n6)When ~984,875K STBZ are circulating, weekly em. reduced to 4.004,5166x0,75 = 3003,3874 STBZ\n\nFirst reduction period (after 500K has been reached) would last ~20Weeks, second periode 13weeks, third period 9Weeks, 4th period 6weeks, 5th period 4 weeks, 6th periode 4 weeks.\nFrom the time where 500K STBZ have been emitted, the emissions would therefore last ~56weeks, or 1 year and 4 weeks until the transaction burn phase would be initiated.\nHowever, for this second option with only 75% reduction, It might be good to introduce the STBZ transaction tax earlier, eg. when 800K STBZ total supply is reached, which can be used to fill up a vault which funds are used to extend the emission time and add more reduction periods until only 1% annual inflation is reached: \n7th period 2252.2 STBZ; 8th 1689.4 STBZ; 9th 1267 STBZ; 10th 950 STBZ, 11th 712,7 STBZ; 12th 534,54 STBZ; 13th 400,9 STBZ; 14th 300 STBZ; 15th 225,5 STBZ. \nEach period lasting 4weeks, which would extend the emission until annual emissions of 1% by another 36weeks.\n\nThis would result in a total emission time (after the 500K circulating supply has been reached) of 92 weeks, or 1 year and 40 weeks.\n", "choices": ["1 yes to emission halvings", "2 yes to emission reduction 75%",
