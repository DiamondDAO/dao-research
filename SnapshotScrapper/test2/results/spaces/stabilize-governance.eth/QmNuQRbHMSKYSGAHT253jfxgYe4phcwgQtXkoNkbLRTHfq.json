No wrapping involved, and probably low transaction costs per transaction. \n\nAt the same time, the basic function to keep stablecoins at their peg will be actively supported and improved.\nThis basically simplifies and incentivises users to use curve, and let them farm at the same time. \n\nSTBZ Rewards should be transferred to the new pool in the transaction to make consistent dumping less likely. \nHowever, it should be possible to pull out the rewards at any time like in the old pools to keep it user friendly.\nFurther, the suggested time dependent fee of 1-0.1% can be applied as well for the withdrawal.\nTogether with the switching fee, 2 different income streams for the treasury would be created; a frequent one , and a single one when the user leaves.\n\nLast but not least, Stabilize improves its brand identity as a protocol who takes it serious to add value to the ETH ecosystem by actively stabilizing stabelcoins (so far it`s a bit passive). \nStabilize would be surely recognized more broadly in a positive way, and therefore supported from many sides. \n\n", "choices": ["YES, replace the old stablecoin pools with new pools having pool pipes & fees!", "NO, just keep the old pools (no fees, but also no pipes)", "NO, just get rid of all non-interest bearing pools"], "start": 1602716400, "end": 1602889200, "snapshot": "11056458", "state": "closed", "author": "0x63Dbf00C99EaD0635FF5aDf2fd2f1F7F2141fc7C", "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth", "name": "Stabilize"}, "votes": 7, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYA7NqcGcwAq6bwgRmyqb4Z4XmdnyGW73RwkDozDVqe7X", "voter": "0x63dEba4a6CbB30D160E22dC5e0D0FFC79290bED6", "created": 1602862364, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPjsHtSqxWHjzz2ZLorNjRHZD3SdrDUu11jpAPN8Adrhs", "voter": "0xc49C7F778881957361200f4d7eBF6111A1d3EC93", "created": 1602765699, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmb2miwupJ1v8DyTiQB4MLtLwJ2XkJtZTCQXcTqArADoFy", "voter": "0x1d5E65a087eBc3d03a294412E46CE5D6882969f4", "created": 1602731015, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmS588nJJNGwSd6FcH8wmvCSZXJ6rbMVM7s2NgHf4uM7jN", "voter": "0xebF980c3A80F6291Fc1B28eBcE55521c2FA4E7cc", "created": 1602727705, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUQNN7MJH2ffMoR832HmwQoZtmBmfgDXXaqQdczG56Ef8", "voter": "0x1D9e324E5FCE00E6fa955E453e3d1Aa1F43f33E6", "created": 1602725518, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVBg3PGpN28cuKZxkSDxYBsViPumdwzGi7J6LxLGCZ1jY", "voter": "0x23C0954C4b997c58A1544717dE90C8E174eA194c", "created": 1602724526, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWvE5yVu46PdG258QkJfDKiMvxnPCKgCkU2kt1znVJKmG", "voter": "0x63Dbf00C99EaD0635FF5aDf2fd2f1F7F2141fc7C", "created": 1602717134, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}]}
