This would enable users to easily take advantage of a sitiation where a stablecoin is above it`s peg of 1$ (with therefore  low interest) and swap into a stablecoin which is at or below its peg (with therefore high interest), finally increasing the STBZ-yield and total amount of stablecoins for the user.\n\nStabilize itself would benefit since its usage and basic functionality to bring stablecoins closer to their peg would be improved: Users would more likely sell stabelcoins to the market when their peg is above 1$, thereby increasing the available supply of that stabelcoin and reduce the price. \n\nThe best sollution may be a smart contract integration of curve finance, which is the most popular low-slippage stablecoin dex. This has the advantage that only 0.04% fee is lost in the transaction between the pools; in comparison to Uniswap where due to the rooting from one stablecoin (via ETH) to another stablecoin the fee would be 0.6%.", "choices": ["YES, please integrate pool pipes between stablecoin pools", "NO, leave it like it is"], "start": 1602345600, "end": 1602619200, "snapshot": "11028623", "state": "closed", "author": "0x63Dbf00C99EaD0635FF5aDf2fd2f1F7F2141fc7C", "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth", "name": "Stabilize"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVdbm68HEwtoZjMNBMNcjSTgnYUyEUMvn6uN94h9xVVLD", "voter": "0x8204D4fAFf3449aA820698651E2A6d81bF5500d4", "created": 1602419032, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUr96L4EzXv77QHq4rezjg6Jxem2s7LUj2HDvRwhLsgxg", "voter": "0x63dEba4a6CbB30D160E22dC5e0D0FFC79290bED6", "created": 1602355260, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWHkEanjjMQwCX8SdeY7FNZFDoC3so1oJiuzEiW3WV2yQ", "voter": "0xfB855099Fd32a444d527aA9157aCf88d9EA78b77", "created": 1602348795, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT59VprWpqnL8jmxqYWr1GkkB3G8DBitzURFkSX9y7omr", "voter": "0x63Dbf00C99EaD0635FF5aDf2fd2f1F7F2141fc7C", "created": 1602345675, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}]}
