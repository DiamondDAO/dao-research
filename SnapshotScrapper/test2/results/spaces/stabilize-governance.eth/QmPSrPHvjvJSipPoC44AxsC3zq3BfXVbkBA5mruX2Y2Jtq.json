The higher the stablecoin is above its peg, the less reward it should get, the lower, the more reward it should get.\n\nHowever, the current implementation does not factor in the size of the pools when balancing the STBZ emissions based on the price. \nThis has the effect that funds in a pool with a small pool size might get a higher yield even if the price is higher compared with a pool with a large size & low price per stablecoin.\nThe more users switch to a higher yield pool , the lower gets the yield of that pool, which hinders the aimed stabilization & gives users uncertainty about switching.\n\nIt is therefore suggested to factor in the pool size in combination with the current price-dependent method.\n", "choices": ["Yes, please factor in the pool size", "No, leave it like it is", "maybe"], "start": 1603641600, "end": 1603814400, "snapshot": "11126508", "state": "closed", "author": "0x63Dbf00C99EaD0635FF5aDf2fd2f1F7F2141fc7C", "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth", "name": "Stabilize"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYUZsqmy34q1BgpyJYzGNWnPqMVsWS1HUDNa8LAPdcESE", "voter": "0xF62405e188Bb9629eD623d60B7c70dCc4e2ABd81", "created": 1603768015, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ4JMyVUUgfUaixVNhzCKJfLPusBQXDh9UqTERuBkstnb", "voter": "0xafDB09Ee00C899299D1f9D9722E80206f070853F", "created": 1603692013, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVghUsqhuuXmQdLGDQ7CiXzPoWFohNrnqGfJkFoCWE1BS", "voter": "0x7A13BFC2f21809A0eC1c8f787DFA5136579EB6D1", "created": 1603666538, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcyjFQ7WrRpJgo2eVJMvzmDz7sM397tsnAmqATiKxAmaN", "voter": "0xcF8D7CC8900c8C6344C9C5e9A674e44171Cd92FD", "created": 1603665989, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR27YoPgzjQvvihoZdYwGJ36uEQfbXnYP6pYWGZiDbcZX", "voter": "0xa95587aebC2713DCc3B992363280DE9979Add61A", "created": 1603647885, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPtf7rLGN9oYmxKkdWZm7NHsKefJdCfa4sm37kWWx6RGV", "voter": "0x63Dbf00C99EaD0635FF5aDf2fd2f1F7F2141fc7C", "created": 1603642158, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}]}
