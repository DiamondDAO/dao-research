But at the end this probably creates more fees overall since users would switch more frequently.\n", "choices": ["Yes, please change withdraw fees from time- to price-dependen", "No, leave it like it is", "maybe"], "start": 1603641600, "end": 1603814400, "snapshot": "11126508", "state": "closed", "author": "0x63Dbf00C99EaD0635FF5aDf2fd2f1F7F2141fc7C", "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth", "name": "Stabilize"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUJJ2cnZeYTvAK947b267nWGALMAzQsbJYfzFLguX7kJS", "voter": "0xa95587aebC2713DCc3B992363280DE9979Add61A", "created": 1603794881, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSddzFot3E4uKGUpVWRMijMBzmhqweSY92C2bwK6LVNPu", "voter": "0xafDB09Ee00C899299D1f9D9722E80206f070853F", "created": 1603691937, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSdrX2F1LPgAncsXYQN3vjG8uGdWK2f4RWhWKaU3TM4oY", "voter": "0x4Cc18cCe039F566DF275Bf375896689F885AdE46", "created": 1603691917, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmd1XR9nDmwahnefXzfku6arEpEczWpPBefXAp9FopFS4T", "voter": "0x01173Bd5895Acf19c67F6170f15d503D4153CF04", "created": 1603651312, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWaJrrSbiS6UFE1JoJxaYpmmqwiX5muPQjDWHXX4w3mu6", "voter": "0x63Dbf00C99EaD0635FF5aDf2fd2f1F7F2141fc7C", "created": 1603642213, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}]}
