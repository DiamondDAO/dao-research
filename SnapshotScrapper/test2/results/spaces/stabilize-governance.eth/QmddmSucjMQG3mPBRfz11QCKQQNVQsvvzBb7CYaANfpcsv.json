This model allows for a price floor for each STBZ but doesn't provide a mechanism for incentivization for executing routine protocol functions and development of new strategies by the core team.\n\nWe propose the development and usage of a new GasTreasury that sits on top of the TreasuryFurnace. The treasury profits would be diverted to this treasury first. This treasury would subsidize the gas cost for minting new week STBZ and re-balancing pool rewards, in addition, WETH could be extracted to pay for new strategies by the team after a timelock. Finally, the team can push all remaining treasury funds to the original TreasuryFurnace for redemption by STBZ token holders.", "choices": ["Implement the GasTreasury", "Keep the current system"], "start": 1608558600, "end": 1608584400, "snapshot": "11497137", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1a776c84d64eCADA985C968c3589B3c8615A1e7C", "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth", "name": "Stabilize"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qme3Ywvm325abqSCXXtz9e6eTDpJ7vncLdh4xyf9Btrk8E", "voter": "0x909Ae1fC12c1C64F7554dC27a1c7785EFaba79b7", "created": 1608560146, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "stabilize-governance.eth"}}]}
