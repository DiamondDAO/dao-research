This base protocol token will be distributed to holder and specific wallets based on an agreed upon % valued as an integer. \nThis integer can be a whole number from 0 to 100 with a preferred upper limiter of 15-20 depending on the preference of economy at scale. \n\nThese integers should be voted on and brought into account during times of strife for the people where distributions of wealth are more necessary than times of economic prosperity for the people whereas the vote could determine the integers to be higher for the DAO. \n\n{Campaign Marketing}\nThis should be an internal committee function yet known to all how, when, and what occurs at these meetings to continue in our efforts to maintain transparency for all. \n\n{Manifestations}\nI for see many active nations as well as sovereigns participating in this governance as time goes on. I would hope this allows for the ebs and flows of the economy to be less of a hinderance on the lunar econosphere. \n\n{Funding}\nNo Funding Needed\n\n{The Partner's Commitment to the DAO}\nFully Committed to the DAO\n\n{Misc}\nFeel free to drop anything you think pertinent to your proposal here\n\nI Logan Ryan Golema hereby swear to this proposal as being though out, derived from a desire to succeed, and for my fellow lunar inhabitants.\n\n", "choices": ["I'd like to know more", "Sounds like a good protocol add", "No I have a better Solution", "Discuss in Comms"], "start": 1629478800, "end": 1631984400, "snapshot": "12788072", "state": "closed", "author": "0x96706EB471F875a9a41442f358d3B34ba02F868b", "space": {"id": "lunargovernance.eth", "name": "Lunar Governance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
