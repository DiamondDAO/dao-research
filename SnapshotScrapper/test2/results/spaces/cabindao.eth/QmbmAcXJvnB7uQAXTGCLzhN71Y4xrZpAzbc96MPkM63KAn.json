KPIs: Lolz and memes.\n\n## Core responsibilities (first 3 months)\n- Facilitate discussion and create alignment within the DAO on what we mean by \"decentralized city\" and how it might operate in practice.\n\t- How do the physical nodes interact with the online community?\n\t- How many nodes do we want over time? How will we acquire/finance/manage them?\n\t- How will the nodes be used in future seasons? Who gets to use them? What does Cabin DAO get in return?\n\t- What's the legal framework?\n- Break down plan into a series of Projects and Bounties for next 1-2 seasons\n- Establish norms of usage at Hill Country e.g. Welcome Guide for guests\n- Pursue further development of the Hill Country node (e.g. new cabins?)\n- Engage with other groups interested in creating physical spaces associated with Cabin network\n- Get our remaining Season 2 Passports sold\n\n## Qualifications\n\nI've spent the last 5 years using real estate to create community and belonging.\n\nCreative real estate development (day jobs):\n\n- Founding team of Culdesac - building the first post-car neighborhood in the US.\n\t- Drove financing, legal structuring, and brand for $170m, 1000 person ground-up development in Tempe AZ\n- Advisor/consultant to Kift\n\t- Created the business model and GTM plan for Kift's \"decentralized city\" based on camper vans\n\nIntentional communities (passion projects):\n- Have started 3 intentional communities (2 purchased, 1 leased) - RGB, Radish, and Hinterlands\n- Write Supernuclear a blog on how to create and manage intentional community\n\n## Compensation request\nI anticipate spending 40% of my time over the next 3 months and would request to be compensated 400\u20a1 split 50/50  between \u20a1 and USDC.\n\n", "choices": ["Aprove", "Deny"], "start": 1634745600, "end": 1634918400, "snapshot": "13456992", "state": "closed", "author": "0xC3268DDB8E38302763fFdC9191FCEbD4C948fe1b", "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth", "name": "CabinDAO"}, "votes": 15, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSnJ32hmKk7d2CciRCCqFAUzUxvjtKq95rfjzFcTEpC7z", "voter": "0xF106f111Db3E0cFCD64b0c0D3787432BF8aD42c8", "created": 1634841180, "choice": {"1": 107}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmREAK35EicxjGAj5uBWuEoPwqTz79CarYWsGw43Ht4TRB", "voter": "0xA257B8FBeedA614A31215a6626192815cfc96Dab", "created": 1634838073, "choice": {"1": 2, "2": 1}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYXHwnJnDwwaam3SHfMAvQPY1ZYXDgoRGg4e6GPEYAmQY", "voter": "0x029EE42d381C9809493F34095235843625E46676", "created": 1634835957, "choice": {"1": 75, "2": 25}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeqWb4AzeUKMDVXT5PBsxwTNQbtDhHjAyLbjTFy5RiXU1", "voter": "0x58726e08D9a0487854F642217559cD15fFe7d8fC", "created": 1634830123, "choice": {"1": 100}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNox5vn7bp5ijKQPGyaQYzanUpT9KsmVowVbqAqwcKNxz", "voter": "0xb19328E83E9De535867fC7b260c100F197C05029", "created": 1634825126, "choice": {"1": 1}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYaH3eBKtWBPRWk3v4mBu6Y4z9EzNrpKSnpV4MmLjuLux", "voter": "0x06e52dA86A6bab51638744279bF0E16AAf1a707B", "created": 1634797324, "choice": {"1": 1}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWnUTxdeciL6qux2QPewsXSg5d5gt3pgiYTCcqr6faMhD", "voter": "0x282173335ae1F328b34Eb9Acadc052E59E70A89f", "created": 1634786824, "choice": {"1": 400}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSHLPVKDj5XaGzerU3cDLmQZYdm93AcCb57eTxbDBL1rb", "voter": "0xB91833386627cb178D99fEbad89236E35C0AD43f", "created": 1634780460, "choice": {"1": 1}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRWvCrkwoUrZouEpMPvMvyQWF2nAaft9huNar46biGLMA", "voter": "0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549", "created": 1634778345, "choice": {"1": 75, "2": 25}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVxhG59tjaUnKpdYzRWPv7tffQFbNiQFe3CfS1XvSLMLa", "voter": "0xC3268DDB8E38302763fFdC9191FCEbD4C948fe1b", "created": 1634774013, "choice": {"1": 3, "2": 1}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXw1UcVqkUb4Rrf1w1xd3NjgFgn8U32HQT7653tfWFqNK", "voter": "0xE5B619f1bFC494A16145F9dfb8A4857B60388256", "created": 1634773114, "choice": {"1": 1}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ1PRQeYHS1jqEZEBitt3ZXfdt9cS81eE3R44ggd3f3q7", "voter": "0xd77e1430081B27B9bd591Fa9f6DaA8B1787C8eeC", "created": 1634772748, "choice": {"1": 1}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRY7Z413NY4Aem8DgaqespJbAjrXesUFsRmYT9zzGysVq", "voter": "0x0F25809d8E83AbC5Ff0f4Ceb8A8C39c79746d0B6", "created": 1634772500, "choice": {"1": 1}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTZFJnXaYTi39i6DkbqejyHYudmBPwqZ5kLsPeRDdkSRQ", "voter": "0x9A6FC94cc1056E5696a538A6Ec78247be731e233", "created": 1634771862, "choice": {"1": 1}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU8A5e4D5LbesSJqcZmU9qkxWgQBm86KkqA1woEU9Rg2q", "voter": "0xe52FC5De4272Cdef6A671178851e323A4B412891", "created": 1634766386, "choice": {"1": 100}, "space": {"id": "cabindao.eth"}}]}
