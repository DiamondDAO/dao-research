It takes up a lot of her time, which is starting to negatively impact her IRL activity.\n\nShe is one of the people in the community who invests the most time in Tornado. She works about around 3 days a week creating content for Tornado. As such, I propose that she get compensated for the work she has done and the work she will be doing in the future, as she will continue to work with Tornado in the long term.\n\nAfter reflecting with @rezan, we suggest that she get paid 200 TORN for the work she has done since the beginning (2 months of work), as well as a monthly salary of 100 TORN per month from now, so that she get rewarded for the quality work she does.\n\n# \u2013 **Most important contributions** \u2013\n\n\n* [[***LINK***]](https://wutornado.medium.com/whats-up-tornado-let-s-catch-up-with-2021-f52bbd0fa40e) Informative and educational article about past proposals,\n* [[***LINK***] ](https://wutornado.medium.com/whats-up-tornado-the-community-is-brought-up-to-light-2a1fda0ddc9e) Proposal #7 article to present the rationale behind the Community Fund and encourage people to vote for the proposal,\n* [[***LINK***]](https://wutornado.medium.com/whats-up-tornado-buy-the-rumors-the-news-9a1403e3fedb) Future Tornado updates article,\n* [[***LINK***]](https://tornado-cash.medium.com/tornado-cash-bsc-deployment-proposal-96dfc06055f8) Upon request from [***@rstormsf***](https://torn.community/u/rstormsf/summary), one of the Tornado founders, Tornado BSC integration article, published on the Tornado Cash official Medium.\n* [[***LINK***]](https://wutornado.medium.com/whats-up-tornado-weather-announcement-made-by-binance-90eb75ba4cb2) Article about the TORN listing on binance\n* Writing tweet for the official Tornado Cash Twitter account\n* Translation of Tornado app (**[https://app.tornado.cash ](https://app.tornado.cash)**) in french to give more visibility among French crypto users (implemented since June 11th 2021),\n* [[***LINK***]](https://wutornado.medium.com/whats-up-tornado-sabliers-are-back-in-style-d59ccf465111) Article about the multisig's signers salary\n* [[***LINK***]](https://wutornado.medium.com/whats-up-tornado-the-tornado-was-live-in-action-f8edf387efed) Article about the @poma's podcast on Epicenter,\n* [[***LINK***]](https://wutornado.medium.com/whats-up-tornado-we-heard-some-noise-in-the-chatroom-31a439e61fb8) \"Rumors\" article -
