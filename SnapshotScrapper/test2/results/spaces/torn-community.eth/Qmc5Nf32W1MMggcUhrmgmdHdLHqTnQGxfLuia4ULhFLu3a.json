{"id": "Qmc5Nf32W1MMggcUhrmgmdHdLHqTnQGxfLuia4ULhFLu3a", "title": "Add 2 new members to the community multisig II", "body": "## Background\nAbout 2 weeks ago, a proposal was posted to add 2 new multisig members in the Tornado Cash community multisig ([link](https://snapshot.org/#/torn-community.eth/proposal/QmYm5eyY5KbidKcKaQ75cnD5AEsimUwJzPCKQaiPCiCkH5)). Despite the strong support for this proposal, it did not reach the 5k vote quorum. The main issue that prevented people from voting was that many have their tokens locked up in Tornado governance, LP pools and staked LP pools. All these tokens couldn't participate in the vote. We upgraded the Snapshot strategy to allow all of these tokens to vote and decided to give the proposal a second chance.\n\n## The proposal\nProposal #7 successfully setup a community multisig treasury funded with 5% of the overall TORN available to governance. The multisig was funded with 22,916 TORN + 4,583 TORN every month for 12 months. The initial elected members were Rezan, Ethdev and Justing Bram forming a 2-of-3 multisg. 2-of-3 is a rather low threshold creating a risk of collusion. Initially, when making the proposal it was hard to find community members committed enough to join the multisig. Since the proposal passed, attention was brought to the idea and new members have manifested their interest to join the multisig. The address of the multisig is: 0xb04E030140b30C27bcdfaafFFA98C57d80eDa7B4\n\nAdding 2 new members to the multisig and upgrading the threshold to a 4-of-5. The new threshold will lower the risk of collusion and is more in line with the amount at stake.\n\nBeing member of the multisig includes a remuneration of 100 TORN per month. The remuneration counts for the work of multisig signer AND the various contributions of the member to the Tornado ecosystem. It is expected more from the members than just signing a few transactions per month.\n\n## The candidates\n2 solid candidates from the community have manifested their interest to join the multisig:\n\nBt11ba: https://torn.community/t/proposal-7-tornado-cash-community-fund/998/54\nXGozzy: https://torn.community/t/proposal-7-tornado-cash-community-fund/998/52", "choices": ["ACCEPT - Add Bt11ba & XGozzy", "REJECT - Don't add members"], "start": 1625068800, "end": 1625328000, "snapshot": "12736391", "state": "closed", "author": "0x48dd5eAFCaeB05854D4cDFE365719Aac83E4754F", "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth", "name": "Tornado Cash"}, "votes": 16, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTKmyR4PgR6r983MTLfx1Y2eJGD77X336iDYgWW5VrfPG", "voter": "0xa6eDC956290b7Ce416c5d8EDc67E1C32506Fe099", "created": 1625321004, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNtciHoqJ5ndTtqMV2LLy2myRwnMwEh6Dw2PZGHyXeLGz", "voter": "0xbAa882D68FC5325fC3899dE264F24B5981523A5C", "created": 1625278076, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX7m8jWQqeCn9fYt5AR6kzJaknXoRLd3oLaC3a1UAyKS1", "voter": "0xAD5bBEd1018A3245499c0BAB98971d2a0758ef43", "created": 1625258598, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZJusZo5TRb7cgeBQToZ57UDp8mYWXJay1XNmtUQQvDr6", "voter": "0xB631651cB570bA0C0D696bD5E4860cbD214f20a0", "created": 1625230984, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNiniw1G4TTz34BzZ6gePw6ZZXCckuUK4c9Czvbxe7W2P", "voter": "0xcD29c9a934208d1C0683579614f5d52DF2873A13", "created": 1625213332, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmbb1PzrGT2SSynBH4xbiyAyqqeFeU3T4BK5uhpybQdmkt", "voter": "0xA29DbaA84a9949A0A38a2Ba07E0b75e6603934DB", "created": 1625185674, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWopbPFm5zZXvZFH96Vz1vEhEF6GzdH8LukwUt9SY8N2j", "voter": "0x8904FFC6Aa039dB5941De11309a42372F3F7D2FD", "created": 1625172836, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmca2a2qTDReWunKbUirWgUw64fZ7k75zYWb53HXRVFbDM", "voter": "0x66d0E180af64fb368679F91765Affc99174396AC", "created": 1625167601, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "QmetNn6fwJv2ZGQHPrqnHXGdf7crBLfTHNApXzjpmKh89K", "voter": "0x9Efb9f2A73833c30686487d53246aB11Ce96163d", "created": 1625128710, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY7QchVGYCAZXLA5tQYybWgSW3aH1YpLxi2TU95SDJ463", "voter": "0x06E9925d3E8c642371232e7492C3916D6B855AaA", "created": 1625125219, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "Qme8T8DFrMFcmhAPCGumiW7XYSus9a4iRne2zM1amw5Nwi", "voter": "0xBD1f7d88C76A86C60d41bDDD4819fAe404e7151E", "created": 1625096038, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbZH4db3fCE5EuweSgLAXFaQSBcfwP5kWjZaaRTU5ekAr", "voter": "0xc13877E8203bD395B5dF47E02138Cc08a4b8e566", "created": 1625078110, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWNn1RNdwAQxF7LLQXj4f7hiAmFmQLXo4ixjL3kK2SHet", "voter": "0x9ff84B91998dF96A6587DB8dDe8D4E47518107d6", "created": 1625074426, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTkwBogVg2cKejqJEj9T1RBghc9aUx3cMFzhBxZBm5kTZ", "voter": "0x79a98A9F41051e119cad1b9fFeFe523cd0Be65f0", "created": 1625073699, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcS3GW1M6sudCN5s7oFEBeXk7fGUhdKwLjfjKGtnPZb3K", "voter": "0x50836822af94BB883d52EE180682b6035B2603D4", "created": 1625073635, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQkMvsKbduToXBUG82nxk6QpWDfpwKfrPSTCcjVFcm79p", "voter": "0x8E135A49282863157BdB05063a54FE26DBDD2628", "created": 1625072829, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}]}
