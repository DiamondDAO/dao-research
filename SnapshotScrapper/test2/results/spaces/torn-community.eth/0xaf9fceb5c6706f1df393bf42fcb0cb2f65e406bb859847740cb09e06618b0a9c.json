They aim to provide an \"unstoppable infrastructure protocol\u201d, which will allow any person across the world to deploy their application without incurring heavy DevOps costs and freely run any application they wish to run. StackOS furthermore intends to help brick and mortar businesses around the globe, to go online cost-effectively and securely with minimal technical overhead.\n\n# What could be interesting for Tornado ?\n\nStackOS can run a three node cluster of Tornado Web UI servers to ensure robustness and performance. \nThis cluster would be fully monitored, and would automatically recover from hardware failures. To implement this, the multisig would fund the server costs, at a cost of 100$ per month for a 1 year period ($TORN to be converted to stable coins to avoid volatility), if the community is OK with it.\n\n# Snapshot vote\n\nThanks @rezan to set up a simple [YES / NO] snapshot next week and insert the snapshot link below my post for the community to decide whether or not they want to implement this system and compensate for server costs :)\n\nFeel free to share your opinion!", "choices": ["ACCEPT", "REFUSE"], "start": 1637053200, "end": 1637312400, "snapshot": "13625843", "state": "closed", "author": "0x48dd5eAFCaeB05854D4cDFE365719Aac83E4754F", "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth", "name": "Tornado Cash"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x0ba4ff3dab30a22ea190aaf7b769e139931080b113172aade0de1704cf47f622", "voter": "0xDcdB53E8E1123BAA64a0B7d3Da13E360CA843797", "created": 1637197993, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "0x54b226ed45cb75e983ac0df4f6897f826db2df4dd5cb67324110f370ed64636c", "voter": "0xc13877E8203bD395B5dF47E02138Cc08a4b8e566", "created": 1637196459, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "0xd566096a7de44fc9503fcbb08dda310a71de1b4f0847cc4c72b7c4d1c3762fd2", "voter": "0xeBF9F70a8C0878d7e701c583bF096D0335623693", "created": 1637148891, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "0x8357a61fbe08e0605c5a34fcd099ee00550e4b7188da43ff81480a3ed49293ee", "voter": "0x78c0A25CcC21604B3D117100DE7c9523f53236C7", "created": 1637121090, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "0x068319c14b2115cfcdd077363bee459d6de43204f73066f8075c13e3d8b9c864", "voter": "0x665967fAf572697E53969C0B7E8BD336b1fAC885", "created": 1637109467, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "0xd07b24ebd49edb9415a3d823e9dbb12383ea64d5e07eac2d5ffca2278497b5d2", "voter": "0x8a14E4af27e6e6feC7063a47982D8E300a3787FE", "created": 1637075838, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZEMHeVz4wmbBFsuYwjqZQCsZ5Lp5sJ4AZEYNGXyVvDzC", "voter": "0x8133A5DCbA30387E88B8Dd3B782797ae00DefCc0", "created": 1637067130, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "0x4ce7c4cbfef2bffac930f3d0b5d6dab60bda255fac85970bc68b40f4ed813ac8", "voter": "0xF4844a06d4f995C4c03195AfcB5Aa59dCBB5b4Fc", "created": 1637062669, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}, {"id": "0xd48b2a53520778fa4ca4e1ac5c03526eac2bec954c1bba4ac2501c470e78ac90", "voter": "0xb3a7FBC2fa38C18ad4433aE93FE7F215Fd2D057f", "created": 1637058290, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "torn-community.eth"}}]}
