Familiar owners have a chance to suggest how FLOOT's LOOT votes in LIP-3.\n\nSummary\n\nIn accordance with LIP-0, the keys which control the Loot contract will soon be burned. These keys control the ability to set royalties. This is a proposal to set a royalty before the keys are burned, and direct the funds to an on-chain treasury controlled by Loot owners.\n\nIf approved, the same royalty will be set across all marketplaces:\n\n    Open Sea\n    Rarible\n    Loot Exchange\n\nFuture marketplaces can leverage Rarible's on-chain registry to detect and apply royalties.", "choices": ["0%", "2.5%", "5%", "7.5%", "10%"], "start": 1633762080, "end": 1633860000, "snapshot": "13383526", "state": "closed", "author": "0x0EbAC44fca2453616dA415C0be23529920fb8223", "space": {"id": "flootfamiliar.eth", "name": "$FLOOT & Familiars"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmaL6RcaeN5LSBjPkXXpHh4wCH44cjDBYc4iJaG5yAfrSh", "voter": "0xcd882Ea4a38968f5d8ae4d7c77d8C20317A2Dda0", "created": 1633855542, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "flootfamiliar.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSmxF9mTW4ktTLBTDXUTD2835WA2ksjK97N4s6T9dgbLh", "voter": "0x0EbAC44fca2453616dA415C0be23529920fb8223", "created": 1633769239, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "flootfamiliar.eth"}}]}
