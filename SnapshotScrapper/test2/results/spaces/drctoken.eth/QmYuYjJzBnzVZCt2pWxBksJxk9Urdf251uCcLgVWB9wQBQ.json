{"id": "QmYuYjJzBnzVZCt2pWxBksJxk9Urdf251uCcLgVWB9wQBQ", "title": "DRC Foundation Grant Proposal #001", "body": "Tl;dr:\n\na) The DRC Foundation wishes to provide a $3000 grant to Emmanuel Okwori, a DRC community member, to assist in the purchase of a printing press premises in his local area of Benue State in Nigeria. \n\nb) The remaining $3000 ($6000 total) will be opened towards the DRC community to donate towards. All contributions of $500 or more to the Foundation Fund, in the form of USDC, ETH or DRC, will be rewarded with a GEN01 NFT.\n\n-----\nProposal\n\nA digital printing company in Benue State, Nigeria, is looking to auction off the company, rights to its premises and the associated printing equipment.\n\nThe total cost of this opportunity is $6000. The DRC Foundation proposes a grant of $3000 to be transferred in WETH from the DRC Foundation Fund to Mr. Okwori\u2019s personal Ethereum address, where he can then withdraw and utilise the funds for the above opportunity.\n\nThe DRC Foundation will also encourage community members to donate to fulfill the full $6000 requirement; an additional $3000 target for donations will be set. Community members that donate a minimum of $500, in the form of USDC, ETH or DRC to the DRC Foundation Fund will also receive a GEN01 NFT.\n\n-----\nRationale\n\nMr Okwori is a long-time supporter of DRC through his role as lead admin in the DRC Africa community. Thanks to his regular and positive contributions to the community space, and his on-the-ground efforts for DRC, including holding digital asset seminars in his local area and creating DRC-themed t-shirts and graphics, Mr. Okwori has shown himself to be one of DRC\u2019s most trusted contributors.\n\nAs Mr. Okwori\u2019s profession is within the digital media space, this opportunity aligns well to his skills and connections. He can use the facilities to contribute to the outreach campaign in Nigeria and Africa proper.\n\nThe DRC Foundation would like to extend this offer to Mr. Okwori based on the quality of the business opportunity, and the offer is bolstered by the understanding of Mr. Okwori\u2019s character and desire to progress DRC in his region of Nigeria. A grant such as this is not an investment in a business, but in a staunch believer and humble supporter of DRC.\n\nThe opportunity also allows the DRC community to demonstrate its ethos of a project built by the community, for the community.\n\nThis proposal will be voted on by the DRC community via a Snapshot governance vote. If passed, the DRC Foundation Fund will begin the transfer to Mr. Okwori. Mr. Okwori will commit to regular updates of both his involvement in the business, his efforts to utilise the printing business for the benefit of DRC, and also the financial performance of the printing business.\n\n----- \nBelow is a link to a .pdf file that contains the full proposal from the DRC Foundation, Mr. Okwori's original proposal, a breakdown of the costing and equipment, and a series of photographs of the premises. \n\nhttps://bafybeidgu2cbgco3nd5t2bam7qr5b7l6itmf2wzu3he75njuaz3nid4djy.ipfs.dweb.link/\n-----", "choices": ["Yes - agree with the grant", "No - reject the grant", "Abstain"], "start": 1629198000, "end": 1629565200, "snapshot": "13042154", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2dbC5e8f6a2eAADd01c044CBA36764d6536866b5", "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth", "name": "Digital Reserve Currency"}, "votes": 20, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQo6zSBMA1uNnZJDjMthQtRNvqV8cgcv7rDSQ8Yt5btRZ", "voter": "0xb44274e081Ef91848C5460ecD7799063E31D60D8", "created": 1629499271, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdQjsSEbGwDHknYn1vx2aYFD9KkoUmDKbr8CPTZyvHfYv", "voter": "0x49b2f50a2A9448a1e63F54Ba98B0d790C09316a9", "created": 1629499210, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXR7kacuqDpT95njpNTgPqQ2cEzgdBmgEntaZsSppKKUX", "voter": "0x8C4cA9c03BE68E6C914408bE6928a4227FB141a4", "created": 1629459301, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfEzQSU7G4uD9a1UyrmntXfu4inKCnkFJ1drUY4hbJQaz", "voter": "0xc624D12451163891f36A47647AF81eFfDF10Dc2D", "created": 1629459236, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmdohew9qPBNHSNuzCEyWdXh8Nj6me8XsNu1ZgL6jEn4WQ", "voter": "0xe9805eCAB212EAbf696cf458d2C4840A619Ee6De", "created": 1629459178, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRSxqKgttBUbuSK1Kmz9TLQWXQewDcJ4G1PNP24gBeXuo", "voter": "0x562C37DBE68C3167A6A0c968BfF788B212F90557", "created": 1629432767, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYg4AKHjggnJoYCk1ZkjsjNpyaWyDAExtWZFayoupvsM4", "voter": "0x92288BB1890d95Bf1e02202CDB536Df223dBCBe7", "created": 1629427328, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSkybaiiU5qVrt3xRPRGPZ5wuscdZKLRAhbxk4zccyeBo", "voter": "0xAd3c4974c2DAe7c65572aA4c7C61F59c39D58FD8", "created": 1629415166, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYGW5JDh761EGMTrHcTDKFZ61htYHubbsuEP1wF59S7yC", "voter": "0x390AC486C606c2C7E57907CCdF51d5dC39fe85AB", "created": 1629415084, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPswzMiCq8qkHD2YXh91huLTwHubL3GxyiVYXRh5W99Tt", "voter": "0xa2CF6705cC57226f9AD402A0117219335cbA4B62", "created": 1629415008, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPHkh3Ww9YRZ4KrpaNAKGD3hNr7KKNiiCmxuxwFAYzaYp", "voter": "0x9f82f1854B26A091979C4538303e52a93E0714F9", "created": 1629402601, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQtEwxu6KSRpfQfrRXBuGdtCLL5hJFL8EYtNEa7xjF3nJ", "voter": "0xB3E2Eb3180BEaF883130849EF4fFAbc737C0DA8b", "created": 1629378517, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZxfBC7pwKsVB9WaatyovQSUWwa35y5uAQCM4Y5b1Z4Ph", "voter": "0xDfd60a8E1e17FBb78E8CA332906A822D862f3D57", "created": 1629372650, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWrAy2u2NKqEBAE82SpfNi5NzkfzRNgfYZUPf4oj91ZoK", "voter": "0x17CE430A037aE4Ac8BcE0f0d4882107ced254C23", "created": 1629372632, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcARnGE1F5sKKqCausiqGgNg5aaLN4vg74t9Dr1HSUJEs", "voter": "0xe4651f4aa671e01D60B358146558247bB7CA7f25", "created": 1629371145, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdZ4VX5t2tEAYY618QBzxYgpGzmmhu7CPByxmBWp1b7RU", "voter": "0x73d061ba6824639cc9193Ca5F0320a4eB0623e9d", "created": 1629231544, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQRvEuY8NK9GBXS36qPu9AiZqsH8tn8RMQxPmfuVdert4", "voter": "0x394EFddDB7a7a402A9CFC5D0eF324177FD5673C9", "created": 1629218627, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY34WWeUuLuZ8pgaLmytZVN3qn2ZC9zKugnHGFJTPpq7C", "voter": "0x691b1d2cBB07c8F7A9A9d62a02705a5f22A9001c", "created": 1629207093, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY4TwVQ2cTyFPemN65WS8hxDAXZvRdrP6eQXFvEL2r9gM", "voter": "0x0935f7Bb29bEDd95C5305aA9456bb7E207e3886e", "created": 1629202523, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPAfWCAm8Cm8nGqErwsL9EM1gy2cMK5FU4VBTnoQgSU7N", "voter": "0x2dbC5e8f6a2eAADd01c044CBA36764d6536866b5", "created": 1629200494, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}]}
