This ESU will only replace PAXG with the proposed assets and perform a rebalancing of the percentages.\n\nUpon a successful vote for this proposal, the ESU will commence shortly after a period of time for any patrons to withdrawal if they so wish.\n\nThe following steps would occur:\n\n1. Allow existing patrons of s1 and s2 DR Vaults to withdraw within 24 hours, if they want to.\n\n2. Pause the DR Vault interface for DR Vaults s1 and s2 while the new token allocations are performed.\n\n3. Work on the backend of the data analytics of the DR Vaults and update the interface with the new token allocations.\n\n4. Unpause the DR interface and resume the DR Vaults s1 and s2.", "choices": ["Yes - Proceed with ESU", "No - Do not proceed with ESU"], "start": 1622545200, "end": 1622631600, "snapshot": "12549149", "state": "closed", "author": "0x2dbC5e8f6a2eAADd01c044CBA36764d6536866b5", "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth", "name": "Digital Reserve Currency"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSUuG4wAHkwxMW15wqaC3LP9Ed1kp9uNq4CAzGSyQM1sU", "voter": "0x993F6Da72042C6B8f7385Bd57CDD757114d61e47", "created": 1622612331, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmarbZ8PbZkR4CuLZXoMP5WQeM1AK4FLWPEEvo3xZFBADZ", "voter": "0x9099dd630B7D279f3E14dBc08eE017CDdFce6D13", "created": 1622606390, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmcz2xLU7BwsqT9QhM3aMGfwLNbxgbLTovkmpDn4sK9qtY", "voter": "0x9f82f1854B26A091979C4538303e52a93E0714F9", "created": 1622600589, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVNzSnpqjBNjFpf1ZB7kazQP2QJfNc89PB23rEm7pWuoN", "voter": "0xb44274e081Ef91848C5460ecD7799063E31D60D8", "created": 1622587874, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbPmH98m5RPov3HvhdaoQvofZAQSbKwGinP4evoMFF9cm", "voter": "0x49b2f50a2A9448a1e63F54Ba98B0d790C09316a9", "created": 1622587847, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQ6hcnn2yMznCFjBjhZoM5V2tuzmWhz9MwhqWfRiEMqb3", "voter": "0x29C5FBcE55FC9A38C6e7B1e4351DbA1563A835bF", "created": 1622587797, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVcniKxyPc36HsfaRCN7sST3bt4Y9GZWHkLGMNwMUBTmG", "voter": "0xD166983C2102907ebABC5d31FDaA211c926A9276", "created": 1622583856, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaNSpawGBzbGqB2zMfM2bqpW7Wu5gkubDiiy1GptEUho4", "voter": "0xB3E2Eb3180BEaF883130849EF4fFAbc737C0DA8b", "created": 1622559251, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmayaV1YqyRUekRf2tD9eogozs37yxK9mkrK7UwwYSs16y", "voter": "0x959A1d9c37CBF069f872AdE27FE822d0e037aBEE", "created": 1622559030, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}, {"id": "QmevpPZgNHN71WmqVpB6rqiEadFtbtUrm8uDHeLbkcy9oe", "voter": "0x2dbC5e8f6a2eAADd01c044CBA36764d6536866b5", "created": 1622558813, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "drctoken.eth"}}]}
