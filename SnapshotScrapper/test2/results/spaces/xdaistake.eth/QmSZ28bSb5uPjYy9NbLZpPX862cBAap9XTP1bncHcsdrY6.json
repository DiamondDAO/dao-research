This action is aimed to increase security of the bridge operations.\n\nSyncNode is already the validator of the xDai bridge, the xDai network validator and also participates in the xDai Bridge governance Gnosis Safe.\n\nAfter adding SyncNode's account to the AMB bridge validators set, it is also proposed to increase required number of confirmations for transferring messages through the bridge as so 4 of 6 validators will be required to act to execute transfers between the Ethereum Mainnet and the xDai TokenBridge.\n\nThis proposal is created mainly to expose the decision that needs to be made. It means that even there is no vote for this proposal here, the agreements could be still provided through the confirmations in the Gnosis Safes.", "choices": ["extend the validators set", "keep the validator set"], "start": 1610085600, "end": 1610172000, "snapshot": "11608691", "state": "closed", "author": "0x81f202D0E73894dA6966BF5AabC85d6Ce3aC91f8", "space": {"id": "xdaistake.eth", "name": "xDai Chain"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
