This needs to be urgently fixed because many people, including myself, have funds that are \"stuck\" in xdai, basically I couldn't sell them in xDAI because of lack of liquidity, and I can't bridge them back to etheruem. Another person has SLP tokens bridged to xdai, and they also can't sell it or move it back to mainnet. This needs to be fixed ASAP.
