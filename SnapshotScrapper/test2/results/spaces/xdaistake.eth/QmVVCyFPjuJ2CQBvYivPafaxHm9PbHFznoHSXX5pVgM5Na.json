The reduction is compared to the Ethereum 2 Staking with 32 ETH, which is approximately $44,800. This would be about 2,400 STAKE. For simplification it should be 2,000 STAKE (market value of ~ $38,000 on 12/19/2020). This would make it much easier to for new validators to enter and reduce centralization.", "choices": ["Yes, reduce to 2,000 STAKE", "No, not reduce to 2,000 STAKE"], "start": 1611054000, "end": 1611572400, "snapshot": "11686762", "state": "closed", "author": "0x50D84A38eed106d692840A20a20ABA6df6890d52", "space": {"id": "xdaistake.eth", "name": "xDai Chain"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
