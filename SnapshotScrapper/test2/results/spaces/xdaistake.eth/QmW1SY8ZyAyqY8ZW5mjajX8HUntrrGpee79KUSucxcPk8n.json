This action is aimed to increase security of the bridge operations.\n\nSyncNode is already the xDai network validator and also participates in the xDai Bridge governance Gnosis Safe.\n\nAfter adding SyncNode's account to the xDai bridge validators set, 3 of 5 confirmations from the validators are required to execute transfers Dai<->xDai through the xDai TokenBridge.\n\nThe corresponding transactions have been initiated in the governance Gnosis Safes:\n  * Safe on the Ethereum Mainnet: https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x42F38ec5A75acCEc50054671233dfAC9C0E7A3F6/transactions\n  * Safe on the xDai chain: https://xdai.gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x7a48Dac683DA91e4faa5aB13D91AB5fd170875bd/transactions\n\nThis proposal is created mainly to expose the decision that needs to be made by the xDai bridge governors. It means that even there is no vote for this proposal here, the governors could still provide their agreements through the confirmations in the Gnosis Safes.", "choices": ["update the bridge validators set", "keep the bridge validators set"], "start": 1609999200, "end": 1610085600, "snapshot": "11605048", "state": "closed", "author": "0x81f202D0E73894dA6966BF5AabC85d6Ce3aC91f8", "space": {"id": "xdaistake.eth", "name": "xDai Chain"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
