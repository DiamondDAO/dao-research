We've been working with xDai for some time helping build things like the https://omni.xdaichain.com/, bootstrapping utility with our xDai-a-thon hackathon, and we recently added xDai to DAOhaus making it super easy to launch xDai DAOs! \n\nWe've been interested in exploring a re-brand of xDai chain for some time and it appears that the community might also echo the sentiment, so we're here asking for you opinion on the subject.\n\nDo you think xDai needs a face lift? We can do something simple (such as just creating logos to differentiate $xDai from $STAKE), or do a deeper dive into creating a visual identity system that aids in the shilling and adoption efforts for xDai.", "choices": ["no, things are fine as they are", "just icons for xdai and stake", "yes, we need a full visual id."], "start": 1614394800, "end": 1614999600, "snapshot": "11935695", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9583648c314CDF666F4F555299dB3B36f5d5b2f9", "space": {"id": "xdaistake.eth", "name": "xDai Chain"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
