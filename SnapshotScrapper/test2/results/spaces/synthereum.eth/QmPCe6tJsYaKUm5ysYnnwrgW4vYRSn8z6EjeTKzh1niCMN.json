Hence it could radpily generate revenues for the Jarvis DAO to help the launch of new products/services/incentives (tbd later).\n\nidea is to participate, on polygon Network, to the launch of a similar system of OlympusDao : KlimaDAO\n \nLet's go to the point : \nYou might have heard about OlympusDAO, with their token OHM that  currently offers a staking APY around 7000% on mainnet. \nTheir goal is to become an autonomous value reserve (so not relying on underlying assets like centralized stable coins like USDT/USDC, and so derisking impact of hypothetic government regulation interventions for instance) and they don't hesitate to give high rewards in their young dev phasis (6 first months). \n\nRapid overview of Olympus : https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/stake\n\nInteresting dashboard showing their parabolic growth :https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/dashboard \n\nToo long to deepen it here, so just have in mind that here is clearly huge momentum, communauty, and cross actions with other protocols from this protocol. Their parabolic growing TVL is the proof that - for the moment - this is running very well.  \n\nKlimaDAO is launching very soon a similar DAO to Olympus, on Polygon network, with the approval of Olympus. \n\nNarrative is a bit different (KlimaDAO one is around carbon credits, not reserve assets. We could discuss if it is relevant or not, but it won't change the potential yield to be harvested at the beginning, since mechanics will be the same : high yield staking for 1st movers + bonds offering for discounted purchase prices to foster liquidity acquisition). \n\nlaunchdate : 8/10/21 \nwebsite : https://klimadao.finance/\ndoc : https://docs.klimadao.finance/\ndoc (French unofficial translation) : https://app.gitbook.com/@0xmule/s/klima-dao/~/drafts/-MjypP1MXqQTZ0XNAxCa/@merged  \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/wnNQ5MzW\n+\nMore Info with a twitter thread on the project : https://twitter.com/cryptodetweiler/status/1445482442345701385?t=kCRN7h71nuybi07Cynxy_w&s=19 \n\nidea is to be the among the first into the project, since rumored initial APY could be between 10K% and 30K% (do the maths, at 10000% APY, around 30 days only are enough to break even).\n\nso the vote here would be :\n- does the Jarvis Communauty would like to surf on this project ?\n- if yes, to what extent ?\nRecommendation : 1 to 5% Max of the jarvisDAO total portfolio.\n\nManagement strategy: initial bet has to be picked up back ASAP (when position value doubles, Jarvis sells 50% and position becomes risk free).\n\nTarget: Breakeven in ~1 month \nrisk : Potential lost 100%. \nYet, if presale closed around 330 USD, the token is currently priced between 1200 and 1500 USD, showing a real interest from the apes.\n\nReward : assuming having back initial investment very rapidly (high yield + speculation for potential pump of Klima token), it could generate :\n- Future free cash flow, allowing more boost for farming \n- or revenue for Jarvis future development (Marketing, incentivization, new features, etc.)\n\n Exit strategy : inverse DCA in autopilot or manual Emperor Mode management (could be voted later)\n\nso OK to try, what will you decide ?", "choices": ["No Sorry, too speculative", "Yes, 1% MAX of treasury ", "Yes, 2,5% MAX", "Yes 5% MAX"], "start": 1633600800,
