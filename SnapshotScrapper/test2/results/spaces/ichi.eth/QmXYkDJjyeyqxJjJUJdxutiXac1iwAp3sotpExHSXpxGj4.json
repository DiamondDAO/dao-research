Daniel to receive the following compensation:\n\n- 5% of future Polkadot ICHI token, vested over 3 years from release\n- 10,000 Ethereum ICHI tokens (3 year Sablier Stream)\n- $7,500 per month to cover salary + expenses until Polkadot/Moonbeam ICHI launch\n\nEach of these provisions may be discontinued early by the community if Daniel stops working for the community or the community deems the work is no longer important or satisfactory.  All ICHI hires have a 30 day trial period and the Sablier stream begins at the end of these 30 days.\n\nQ. Why is there an ICHI payment rather than just a Polkadot ICHI share?\nA. Daniel will spend a significant portion of his time supporting Ethereum ICHI until the Polkadot/Moonbeam ICHI launch.  After that, he will continue to support Ethereum ICHI and mentor ICHI founders on other protocols until the end of the 3 year vesting period.\n\nQ. How will the 15% of a future Polkadot ICHI token be distributed to current ICHI holders?\nA. There are many possible methods.  Daniel will evaluate the approaches and make a recommendation to the ICHI community.  As with all things ICHI, an Ichipowah vote like this one will have the final say.", "choices": ["Yes - Hire Daniel", "No - Do Not Hire Daniel"], "start": 1614272400, "end": 1614445200, "snapshot": "11927569", "state": "closed", "author": "0x11111D16485aa71D2f2BfFBD294DCACbaE79c1d4", "space": {"id": "ichi.eth", "name": "ichi.farm"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUrrG6a8tPyPKtwY9xGdzkdJi6cMabZBCFNjYbd7cHCuB", "voter": "0xfD36a82cA5390424CdBFD5485942d50952b58535", "created": 1614361729, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQksnGS8v4nuZcTqvbTjVYnBjrcE2vws8iayYpEbx3s3p", "voter": "0x12C7824845440DA1B0eBfcB33E15CCDB07bceA63", "created": 1614342141, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVDVa6j2pq5ba8eVXfBoHrTbpAn35ukaDjeUYWUbJSWtP", "voter": "0xD5b0A2a96907344A537Eb809A0B75b895492E2f8", "created": 1614305423, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXB24oChh9ZprtB8LQP7zt77QqoPknmNAjcUvWyxjYonp", "voter": "0x47Ea9C5E604Fb483412B0de8Ff5AE4c82B02D065", "created": 1614305406, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVgWqoBV4fZ1ecriMgEMZjswobnxdxtjiiJmmeS57ZkWW", "voter": "0x2dDdb6a69f071313580073941a4491313303b1AB", "created": 1614302961, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXqGQaktNUEad3nVy5N9FpD8B2ZGtCJHJBatLSMaxnniB", "voter": "0x2ecdA5574e4AE1b257Eb439Bc9930fb3aebeF53A", "created": 1614288131, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfPq79MjbamahGhVFUsb77x4DDnNhgRvdoUhp3nGJvyQa", "voter": "0xE4f4d41Bd8DA7AE7e638aEaC9800E67FCd8E2858", "created": 1614279607, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNmKXSdge46umvcRPKmXozXq9BsJk4JF5adswCdkFa5Lr", "voter": "0xb3D516659a8e3e8cFcf45120FCAC0f8a6f2Bc8Ba", "created": 1614279177, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}]}
