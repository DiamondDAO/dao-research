Based on those learnings we make the following two recommendations for the initial parameters of oneLINK:\n\n1.\toneLINK minting fee to be set at 0.2% when minting with USDC and 0% when minting with oneBTC.  This will encourage the use of oneBTC to mint oneLINK, drive greater over-collateralization of oneBTC, and reduce the dependency on USDC.\n2.\toneLINK minting ratio adjust in 0.2% increments instead of 0.1% increments.  Our minting ratios have only gone as low as 96%, not reaching the minimum ratio default of 90%.  A 0.2% increment will allow the excess reserves to collect more LINK if the stablecoin trades at $1 or higher.\n3.\tUse LINK excess reserves to purchase oneLINK and deposit to the oneLINK-LINK liquidity pool. This will allow the LINK excess reserves fund to accumulate yields in the form of trading fees and ICHI.  This will further collateralize oneLINK and support oneLINK-LINK liquidity.\n\nVoting options:\n\nYes to 1, 2, and 3\nNo to 1\nNo to 2\nNo to 3\n\nIf the \u2018yes to 1, 2, and 3\u2019 doesn\u2019t get a majority vote, we will remove the least popular option and vote again until we get an option with a majority vote.\n", "choices": ["Yes to 1, 2, and 3", "No to 1", "No to 2", "No to 3"], "start": 1606512600, "end": 1606599000, "snapshot": "11342850", "state": "closed", "author": "0x11111D16485aa71D2f2BfFBD294DCACbaE79c1d4", "space": {"id": "ichi.eth", "name": "ichi.farm"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
