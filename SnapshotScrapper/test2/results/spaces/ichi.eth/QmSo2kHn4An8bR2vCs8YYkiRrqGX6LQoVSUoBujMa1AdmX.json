This process enabled them to gradually lower the collateralization percentage of oneLINK below 100%.  The core team discovered the issue and removed the ability to use oneBTC as collateral.  This solved the problem.\n\nProposal: Refund the collateral slippage from the ICHI community treasury by depositing ICHI into the oneLINK community treasury.  The exact deposit amount is still be calculated but will be capped at $25K ICHI.  This ICHI may only be sold if it becomes the only remaining oneLINK collateral.\n\nHow will we avoid a similar problem in the future?  We will not use oneX stablecoins as collateral until they have $20M+ liquidity pools.", "choices": ["Yes - provide ICHI to oneLINK collateral", "No - do not provide ICHI to oneLINK collateral"], "start": 1607547600, "end": 1607720400, "snapshot": "11420000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x11111D16485aa71D2f2BfFBD294DCACbaE79c1d4", "space": {"id": "ichi.eth", "name": "ichi.farm"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
