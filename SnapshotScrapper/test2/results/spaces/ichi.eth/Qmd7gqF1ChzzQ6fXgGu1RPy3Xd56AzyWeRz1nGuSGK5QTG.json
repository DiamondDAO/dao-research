Also, ICHI rewards on ichi.farm are being split between 3 pools.  It may be wise to consolidate on ichi.farm and to incentivize an ICHI pool on Uniswap make it easier to purchase ICHI.\n\nOption 1: Do Nothing - Keep the ICHI rewards across the existing 5 pools as-is.\nOption 2: Add a Uniswap pool - every pool gets a 16.67% share.\nOption 3: Add a Uniswap pool and double its share - it gets 28.57% and the pools on ichi.farm get 14.29% each.\nOption 4. Add a Uniswap pool and eliminate rewards for ICHI-oneETH and ICHI-oneBTC.  Each pool gets 25%.\nOption 5. Add a Uniswap pool, double its share, and eliminate rewards for ICHI-oneETH and ICHI-oneBTC.  Uniswap pool gets 40%.
