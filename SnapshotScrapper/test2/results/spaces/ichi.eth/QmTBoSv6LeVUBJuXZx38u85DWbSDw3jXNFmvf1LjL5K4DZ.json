Set rewards for the new ICHI-ETH pool to 50% of the total\n3. Split remaining 50% of total rewards between stablecoin pools\nRationale:\n4. Sunset all existing ICHI pools (ICHI-ETH, oneETH-ICHI, ICHI-oneBTC, ICHI-ETH Uniswap)\n\nHaving liquidity fragmented between 4 pools is counter-productive, and joining them is the obvious solution. The choice of Sushiswap is because they are innovating at a much faster pace than Uniswap thanks to their merger with Yearn, and in order to get ICHI-ETH added to their Onsen program for extra rewards.", "choices": ["Yes - consolidate liquidity by taking the 4 steps above", "No - keep the current approach"], "start": 1607547600, "end": 1607720400, "snapshot": "11420000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x11111D16485aa71D2f2BfFBD294DCACbaE79c1d4", "space": {"id": "ichi.eth", "name": "ichi.farm"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
