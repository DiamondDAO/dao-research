The choice of Sushiswap is because they are innovating at a much faster pace than Uniswap thanks to their merger with Yearn, and in order to get ICHI-ETH added to their Onsen program for extra rewards.", "choices": ["Implement the 4 outlined changes", "Do nothing"], "start": 1607443200, "end": 1607616000, "snapshot": "11412000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x87616fA850c87a78f307878f32D808dad8f4d401", "space": {"id": "ichi.eth", "name": "ichi.farm"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
