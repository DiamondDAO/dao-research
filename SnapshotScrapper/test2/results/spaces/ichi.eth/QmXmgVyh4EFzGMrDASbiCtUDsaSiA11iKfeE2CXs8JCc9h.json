{"id": "QmXmgVyh4EFzGMrDASbiCtUDsaSiA11iKfeE2CXs8JCc9h", "title": "Should we discontinue bumper crop rewards?", "body": "Ichi.farm is publicly-owned and self-sustainable infrastructure designed to assist crypto communities with launching their own stablecoins.  The contracts are not upgradeable, but they were designed to make bumper crop rewards a reversible decision.  This proposal asks whether it is time to discontinue bumper crop rewards by taking the following steps:\n1. Remove bumper crops from the UI\n2. Allocate ICHI remaining in fertilizer to a community treasury\n3. Slow down the aggressive farming schedule that was designed for the (hopefully viral) bumper crop game \n4. Seek to make initial ICHI grants from the community treasury to founding partners who will invest in the project and support it", "choices": ["Yes - discontinue bumper crops by taking steps 1-4", "No - keep bumper crop rewards and the existing schedule"], "start": 1607025600, "end": 1607112000, "snapshot": "11380000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x11111D16485aa71D2f2BfFBD294DCACbaE79c1d4", "space": {"id": "ichi.eth", "name": "ichi.farm"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
