Think https://uniswap.org/ but it will be https://ichi.org/\n \nMotivation\n \nThere is a missing context, for some, when being dropped right into https://ichi.farm/.  There is a docs link, however, the ichi.farm site isn't about the who/what/why of ichi, the community site will be for that.\n \nCredentials\n\nI'm a senior software engineer (fullstack) at Microsoft.  I've been in software engineering for 13 years with 6+ years of experience in React and on the front-end.\n \nSpecification\n \nGatsby (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is an excellent Open Source tool to boostrap a site like this and get everything up and running very quickly without a lot of the boilerplate required.  This should eliminate the need for a designer. \n \nWith Gatsby as the foundation I can leverage input from the Ichi community to get the content to add to modify the site with.\n \nSince this is just a static site we can host pretty much anywhere we want, be it Netlify (current) or any of the major cloud providers.\n \n \nProposal\n \nI need $4,850 oneBTC to cover the cost of acquiring ichi.org and $120 oneBTC for 12 months of hosting.\n \nMy success fee for deploying the ichi.org community website within 2 weeks is $6,000 in ICHI. This reduces by 5% each day the new website is late.\n \nThese payments should be sent to: 0xab240d1cB5d18e245c07f0CBB0808E68ED785b60 (ETH address)", "choices": ["Yes - launch ichi.org", "No - do not launch ichi.org"], "start": 1610035200, "end": 1610208000, "snapshot": "11605000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x11111D16485aa71D2f2BfFBD294DCACbaE79c1d4", "space": {"id": "ichi.eth", "name": "ichi.farm"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUDKqz1UNbjimCSanWxz45EKnmPJtAUccwvF9xmRMiCWA", "voter": "0xb3D516659a8e3e8cFcf45120FCAC0f8a6f2Bc8Ba", "created": 1610128656, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSjQnWe4SXREnWRCAkcjbGCvTpNtR6ypyQ7VDGpWAEJzL", "voter": "0xab240d1cB5d18e245c07f0CBB0808E68ED785b60", "created": 1610111040, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeQtzfEYZJmzrHK7qZzmZ9ZUKFVF1Sd9zRDTKfwECwwT3", "voter": "0x361e84EA0f3Ecd2Bd6348079e6dEDE5c811E6db6", "created": 1610098328, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRMvfSqekVJhWvb2R8TdeJicxjfgM5Vqe2GAj5Bw5mTbm", "voter": "0xd56e63BE822BB54E2214851ab6fc32B580244009", "created": 1610098289, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSwUYxBQx94Ej41UCwPBWK29CLSyUGFMYVdV4XLSi4BPz", "voter": "0x12279b3B6A8C7631aE2De0085b60bc2329eA46a2", "created": 1610097858, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcTKeTF4enECYCDMJvTQNZEksQjP2NsSf9vRMxQ565Bpi", "voter": "0xeCeB2fB4d8a93B0B19273B033ABcA7215062D31e", "created": 1610071645, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQnyFJCJihYCRauHW2FECuhDrXzCDdRWHEc6rJy13yQ7o", "voter": "0x2dDdb6a69f071313580073941a4491313303b1AB", "created": 1610051156, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUTBu7BaTSPBVgk5Bo7M1Ho7Gf3r5n2Eriu5uooQjntBu", "voter": "0x2D5b460d4DdAf8bA66Fe11afa9248E38f19f17CD", "created": 1610040014, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVmRy1A9u85rTi4BP7Fnws6b8er3SXLZzZG8aZmYzxkme", "voter": "0xD5b0A2a96907344A537Eb809A0B75b895492E2f8", "created": 1610039972, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUeF3LCiXX4hKXxTTxx8acbVspiciSuYELqWC6tgXJk9q", "voter": "0x47Ea9C5E604Fb483412B0de8Ff5AE4c82B02D065", "created": 1610039943, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "ichi.eth"}}]}
