{"id": "QmXdrhCZ9Unp2gRrv42dwPmEXTr96u2SgCbx1fJzQMDEf4", "title": "Tiered membership levels", "body": "I'm proposing that we create tiered membership levels, starting with the below three and potentially adding more if we find we need them.\n\nThis would solve the following problems:\n1. The cost to the DAO in time deactivating members that would like to stay involved in some way and would benefit the DAO (such as by bringing in new clients) but don't want to or cannot meet our Criteria for Remaining Active.\n2. The Criteria for Remaining Active is very low, and yet builders still ask to be an exception. This again costs the DAO through time responding and having to consider individual cases.\n3. The option of the Partner tier would mean that deactivation would only occur as part of the Escalation Process (https://docs.dorg.tech/lifecycle/covenant), where the builder isn't moving the DAO forwards in any way due to absolute non-activity and non-responsiveness, or when it just isn't a good fit for either party. Hopefully, this would reduce requests for reactivation, again which takes time and costs the DAO, since instead of deactivating so many members at once, we are likely to offer Partner status to some of them.\n4. The DAOplomat tier would encourage DAO-2-DAO partnerships and introduce dOrg to (and build relationships with) newer DAOs.\n5. We could also offer the Partner tier to people that join our public channels and show interest in working closer with us (this will need some more thought before trying).\n\nThe proposed tiers: \n\nBuilders\nBuilders are what most of our current members are. They can meet our Criteria for Remaining Active by either being on client or internal projects, or they stay in contact via the one vote, one call, one online conversation option. Builders have access to all Discord channels, including client projects, and all forum channels. Nothing changes for most members.\n\nPartners\nPartners are members that cannot meet or are not interested in meeting our Criteria for Remaining Active but support our community and/or dOrg as a business. This could be by providing legal advice, bringing in new clients, liaising on our behalf for some reason. Partners get access to all Discord channels except client channels, and if possible (I can\u2019t see a way to do this) they get access to all forum channels except for the clients thread.\n\nDAOplomats\nDAOplomats are members of other communities that we\u2019re building bridges with. They have access to our DAO-2-DAO channels and our voice channels, so that we can communicate with them and invite them in for informal and formal chats/workshops.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1635152400, "end": 1635584400, "snapshot": "13485789", "state": "closed", "author": "0x44Ec8794D1bB7624c223203E64eaE927d2d46437", "space": {"id": "dorg.eth", "name": "dOrg"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xe1da4b105f05f450b810d9a1257c45870a71c546a8d648039962865fb7a8ef6d", "voter": "0x00F51D0eEd160D53F9D90e70b35A43EbfB618c5b", "created": 1635552480, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dorg.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb39fd01a55a85212efdacb04715f9ada463c38d4c47f53facdb7ade51255a932", "voter": "0xAa01DeC5307CF17F20881A3286dcaA062578cea7", "created": 1635524141, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dorg.eth"}}, {"id": "0x79db0d88ba9682c0578d7ba1b6d7ae948785f42c2c90b6b99f844322cced5b92", "voter": "0x37341cbb14c5F128A70B149726ad8B2CE6F4C793", "created": 1635431394, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dorg.eth"}}, {"id": "0x582bcbf210f43d233cd0c4c1ead52bad373d66e3b046aa8a5fa9d260cbf9b328", "voter": "0xC3C54Ee8B495A5004602AFf40c5880fb8E375aaD", "created": 1635351049, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dorg.eth"}}, {"id": "0x589f9655e778ef9a52da4c24772e47f036ab16ee220689fba2f3e698afcdb0de", "voter": "0xDC4471ee9DFcA619Ac5465FdE7CF2634253a9dc6", "created": 1635349298, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dorg.eth"}}, {"id": "0x89c92809fb29f8d59bc1463662ea6057372a736b7d6029a78227edce51c83029", "voter": "0xEB0C4F040FF0e2278bB2c14B7CC9c357467C83e3", "created": 1635274353, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dorg.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcFAXHvAjBinP5uFEDMYBX2WBP2q5yvmvrzjJR9npNZ3u", "voter": "0x639749b7b08aEe65039c21d8a411103C6ceBEBF0", "created": 1635246903, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dorg.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXRP2ui3VwbBTGaJVpcV2hvJxDk6dBqkLKdZ95ivCBJPm", "voter": "0x2E7F4dD3acD226DdAe10246a45337F815CF6B3ff", "created": 1635154792, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "dorg.eth"}}]}
