This setup supports all ETH mainnet functionality out of the box.\n\nCRD Network uses its own tokens, known as CRD Tokens, as an intermediary currency to ensure ledger compatibility and easy transferability between the different financial spheres. \n\nIn addition, apps built on the CRD Network pay CRD Tokens to the Network Nodes for certain computations and transaction confirmations.\n\n\n2- TOKENOMICS\n\n\nOver time, the applications of the CRD Tokens will grow. The CRD Network has a program in place whereby the system finances the third-party development of new innovative uses of the system.\n\nToken: CRD\nTotal Supply (capped): 1,000,000,000\nProtocol: ERC-20\nSupply Management: Active Supply management Via Treasurer committee.\nNetwork Fees Distribution: % of Network fees\nValidators and Nodes: Master Node Operators\n\n3 - THE UTILITY AND DESIGN PHILOSOPHY OF THE CRD NETWORK\n\nThe CRD Network is designed with a modular design philosophy in mind. As such, a wide variety of FinTech apps (including neobanking services, trading algorithms, and much more) can be programmed on top of it that can seamlessly interact with each other. \n\nGiven the ease with which third-party developers can create FinTech applications for the network, this is a core principle of the business model.\n\nThe financial capital of the CRD Network is used to act as a startup incubator, which provides the financial means to promising developer teams to design novel use cases for the system. This is only done provided that they meet two main criteria:\n\n- They have to have a technological use case that can be deployed and eventually profitably executed on the CRD Network; and\n- They have to partner with a large social influencer to design a bespoke product with built-in demand. It also bears mentioning that the application has to adhere to safety and regulatory protocols, as determined by the WACEO governance board.\n\nBy meeting those two conditions, not only do developers ensure that their product has a built-in audience that strengthens the CRD Network through their participation within the system, but also creates new regulatory compliant applications that people want. \n\nThereby, the CRD Network avoids the main issue that destroys nascent startups - lack of market fit for their products and an inability to convert the wider public.\n\n4 - HOW THE CRD NETWORK OPERATES\n\nIn Section 3 we covered how third-parties are encouraged to develop FinTech apps for the network. Whenever a computation is done by these apps that affect the network, they incur a fee.\n\nMaster Node Holders are network participants who have provided the equivalent of 1M CRD as collateral and through this method staked a CRD Network Node. This allows them to:\n\n* Process and confirm internal system transactions;\n* Receive CRD fees from the system, proportional to their stake in the network;\n* Participate in the governance process on a deeper level.\n\nIn other words, CRD Network Participants can ensure the stability and liquidity of the system by providing the capital necessary to reduce volatility. In exchange, they are rewarded CRD tokens by the network for their contribution. \n\nThrough these Liquidity and Stability programs, potential developers and influencers are assured of the long term viability of the system and are thus more likely to participate in the network\u2019s development.\n\n***\nTECHNICAL ADOPTION TIMELINE\n\n* MAY: User sign up process & Dashboard main, KYC process integration, Metamask integration, DEX integration (via 1inch)\n\n* JUNE: Crypto-Custody integration, Crypto Provider integration (FTX/Kraken)\n\n* JULY: Railsbank Connect, PSD/OpenBanking integration, Swap Fiat<>Crypto\n\n* AUGUST:  Lending functionality, NFT/DAO as a service\n\n\n", "choices": ["ADOPT", "RESCIND"], "start": 1620122400, "end": 1620727200, "snapshot": "12340964", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3Af4ee3B6e61F8792969Ba23cCD218a033398e4d", "space": {"id": "crd.eth", "name": "CRD Network"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
