For practical purposes, they can be traded in decentralized exchanges, like SushiSwap, UniSwap, and soon TacoSwap.\n\nThat said, their primary purpose is to be able to make the apps built on the CRD Network be able to operate smoothly by providing a dependable and predictable environment. Hence price stability is the chief concern, as any extreme volatility would mess with our app designer\u2019s profit margins.\n\nAs such, unlike many other cryptocurrencies, the CRD Token has been pre-minted and there is a firm cap of 1bn. Unlike Ethereum or BTC, they\u2019re not actively mined and the minting function of the contract has been inactive since 2018 and the contract has been closed for minting. You can verify this information on this link [https://etherscan.io/token/0xcaaa93712bdac37f736c323c93d4d5fdefcc31cc#readContract].\n\nPresently, 90.85% of existing CRD are located in three wallets, each of which are visible in the public ledger. They are as follows, as of the 13th of April 2021:\n\n[Wallet 1- no public tag] - PURPOSE: Reserve Fund, Dev Team,Operations Fund, Settlement Payments - #CRDs 702.19m - 0xa5a6707dbad87609c8b21270653e7a0490e9bf21\n\n[Wallet 2 - no public tag] - PURPOSE: A Smart contract of people staking in TacoSwap - #CRDs 145.058m - 0x7f7710e0c7c5c0ff043963dd22c3988e8bdb7acc\n\nPublic Tag:\u201dSushiSwap: CRD\u201d - PURPOSE: SushiSwap Liquidity Pool - #CRDs 61.331m - 0xcaaa93712bdac37f736c323c93d4d5fdefcc31cc\n\n\nWallet 1 will be divided up shortly into various other wallets with variable purposes. Each with a separate utility in the business model, as follows:\n\n\nI - Public Tag: \u201cCRD Dev Fund\u201d - #CRDs 100m - 0x4957871EDAEBDe721364e2038bfD142e23D85F55\n\nII - Public Tag: \u201cCRD DAO Operations Fund\u201d - #CRDs 80m - 0xa08DBE4FC76d2E72C3eAFC7f282D8C3D213A6000\n\nIII - Public Tag: \u201cFounding team allocation vested in 2019\u201d - #CRDs 100m - 0xc6951842CF1E79FcDC37348B1aEbeb68AD391b99\n\nIV - Public Tag:\u201dCRD DAO Reserve Funds and misc\u201d [Status: Locked] -  #CRDs 422m - 0xEA01645548f37D63B48d4226C1b489c13F1f4519\n\n\n\nMost of these funds will not be utilized for the foreseeable future. [Wallet 2] and SushiSwap: CRD are not directly under the CRD Network\u2019s control as they remain locked in liquidity pool Smart Contracts. \n\nEach disbursement from the wallets must comply with the Dev Fund use policy. \n\nThe CRD Network has a firm policy to retain the value of the CRD Token and to preserve the interests of small stakeholders. Large CRD holders are subject to anti-dumping and market preservation strict compliance protocols.\n\nThe prime goal for the CRD Tokens is to remain as a stable medium of exchange that can be operated within the network to facilitate internal and external transactions.\n", "choices": ["ADOPT", "RESCIND"], "start": 1618567200, "end": 1619344800, "snapshot": "12252705", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3Af4ee3B6e61F8792969Ba23cCD218a033398e4d", "space": {"id": "crd.eth", "name": "CRD Network"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmfBZpvbYNWrFSH8DvoniGjc9Nioikf4Sy2n1Tk13pnqUA", "voter": "0x377412c1eB82df671a7a29B73383a13900190701", "created": 1618607122, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crd.eth"}}]}
