As an access token for the DeFi infrastructure bridging cryptocurrency and the traditional fiat financial system, its primary purpose is to remain stable.\n\nYet, if it were to be pegged to a currency, as what you see in stablecoins, the CRD Network would lose a lot of its operability; given that it would be beholden to the price variability of third parties. \n\nThe CRD Network is primarily an environment upon which designers can build apps that rely on secure data storage or financial transaction processing. As such, fluctuations in the price of the CRD hurt the profit margins of app makers by making their operating costs vary from moment to moment. This is contrary to what we want to foster within the operating environment.\n\nConsequently, the CRD differs from most other cryptocurrencies out there in two main ways:\n\n* It has been pre-minted to its full theoretical limit of 1bn, and its availability within the CRD Network is determined by the Treasurer governance committee and a set of disbursement policies. Unused CRDs are kept in a series of Wallets and Smart Contracts, which will be discussed in the \u201cTokens and Management\u201d section.\n\nThe primary goal of the active token management policy is to ensure a relatively stable and predictable price level to enable steady profit margins for app developers within the CRD Network.\n\n* Its primary purpose is to serve as a key to execute transactions within the CRD Network by users, or it would be more accurate to say, by the apps built on the system which the users use. \n\nAs such, the CRD is neither a free-float speculatory token as what you see with Bitcoin nor is it a wholly predictable asset as what you see in stablecoins. The CRD Token is somewhere in between, a wholly different type of Token.\n\nTOKENOMICS\n\n\nToken: CRD\nTotal Supply (capped): 1,000,000,000\nProtocol: ERC-20\nSupply Management: Active Supply management via Treasurer committee.\nNetwork Fees Distribution: % of Network fees\nValidators and Nodes: Master Node Operators\nTOKENS AND MANAGEMENT\n\nPresently, 90.91% of existing CRD are located in six wallets, each of which is visible in the public ledger. They are as follows, as of the 26th of April 2021:\n\n\n* I - Public Tag: \u201cCRD Dev Fund\u201d - #CRDs 100m - 0x4957871EDAEBDe721364e2038bfD142e23D85F55\n\n* II - Public Tag: \u201cCRD DAO Operations Fund\u201d - #CRDs 80m - 0xa08DBE4FC76d2E72C3eAFC7f282D8C3D213A6000\n\n* III - Public Tag: \u201cFounding team allocation vested in 2019\u201d - #CRDs 100m - 0xc6951842CF1E79FcDC37348B1aEbeb68AD391b99\n\n* IV - Public Tag:\u201dCRD DAO Reserve Funds and misc\u201d [Status: Locked] - #CRDs 422m - 0xEA01645548f37D63B48d4226C1b489c13F1f4519\n\n* V - [Wallet 2] - #CRDs 145m - a smart contract of people staking in TacoSwap - 0x7f7710e0c7c5c0ff043963dd22c3988e8bdb7acc\n\n* VI - SushiSwap: CRD - SushiSwap Liquidity Pool - 0xcaaa93712bdac37f736c323c93d4d5fdefcc31cc\n\nMost of these funds will not be utilized for the foreseeable future. [Wallet 2] and SushiSwap: CRD are not directly under the CRD Network\u2019s control as they remain locked in liquidity pool Smart Contracts. \n\nThe remaining 702m CRD, will not be released into the CRD Network until there is a large enough user base to warrant it. As otherwise, if released too early, it could potentially flood the CRD Token market and thereby collapse the price of the tokens permanently.\n\nFor obvious reasons, this is wholly against our goals as an institution and any disbursement will be carefully controlled to ensure a stable business environment and promote network growth. \n\nEach disbursement from the wallets must comply with the Dev Fund use policy.\n\nThe medium to long-term goal of CRD Tokens, as a utility token, is to reach stability relative to a dominant fiat currency, which initially will be the EUR.  The prime goal for the CRD Tokens is to remain as a stable medium of exchange that can be operated within the network to facilitate internal and external transactions.\n\nIt bears saying though that this price stability with the EUR isn\u2019t a firm peg, and so if it\u2019s beneficial for our business interests we might set a different price level to aim for. This decision, along with all other management decisions will be done in accordance with the democratic will of network participants under the regulatory guidance of the WACEO. \n\nHOW THE CRD NETWORK WORKS\n\nThe CRD Network is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) operating under the regulatory guidance of WACEO, a non-profit organization providing DAOs with regulatory frameworks to remain legally compliant. \n\nFrom a system architecture perspective, it is an Ethereum-based bridge based on capabilities provided by Hyperledger Besu, which allows you to have a link between open banking and DeFi in a frictionless and legal manner. As such, users can use DeFi apps without transactions costing a fortune, as one of the primary features of the CRD Network is that it aggregates transactions into as few operations as possible.\n\nThe CRD Network then only settles operations on the mainnet (Ethereum Blockchain) when it is absolutely necessary and packages them into a single execution, so it avoids most high fees present on the mainnet.\n\nThis action of bundling execution opportunities can by itself vastly reduce transaction costs, as the operation costs are shared over thousands of users, but this is not the only thing that we have up our sleeve!\n\nA further means by which costs are reduced is that that many of the operations are settled locally on the CRD Network, and through this method only a reduced number of transactions ever need to be logged on the Ethereum Blockchain. Our goal is always to settle transactions as efficiently as possible by minimizing any potential costs of operations. \n\nIn other words, the transactions are settled locally, and only a small amount of operations are put into a package, which gets logged into the Ethereum Blockchain. However, each and every transaction, no matter how small, is recorded on the CRD Network in some way. So, the CRD Network should be viewed as a platform upon which you can build FinTech apps; or any app that involves payments for that matter.\n\nContrary to what you might expect, the CRD Network doesn\u2019t only just enable cryptocurrency-based systems. As given the EU\u2019s Revised Payment Services Directive, commonly known as PSD2, traditional banks were forced into the 21st century.\n\nAs such, traditional financial institutions had to make customer information available via easily accessible protocols. These APIs then enable us to be able to effectively bridge the formerly disconnected spaces of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc)  and traditional fiat currencies (US Dollars, Euros, British Pounds, etc).\n\n***\nDue to character restrictions on Snapshot, we have separated this proposal into two separate parts.
