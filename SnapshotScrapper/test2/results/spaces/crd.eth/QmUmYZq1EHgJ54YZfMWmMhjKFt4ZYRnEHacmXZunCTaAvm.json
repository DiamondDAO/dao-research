The statements contained within those articles are not only false, but we also interpret them to be malicious in intent and will thereby be addressing them to the full extent of the law, as well as seeking restitution for damages caused. \n\nWe have identified that there are two primary profit motives for organizing these libellous attacks against us:\n\n- There is evidence to support a short-selling campaign related to the CRD Network, meaning that anyone who participates in it stands to benefit greatly by dragging us through the mud and making the story as one-sided as possible. \n- The disseminators of this misinformation have profited from social media monetization off of traffic generated from the defamatory articles.\n\nWe are currently evaluating a step by step approach by which we will address these libellous accusations through the proper legal and relevant channels. We will also be contacting social media providers to stop doing business with these parties which are seemingly profiting from libel by posting half-truths, or even outright fabrications.\n\nThe spearhead of our social media defence strategy will be to go for what allows and motivates them to generate this type of content en masse. Hence we will make a strong case to Google, and thereby to AdSense (which is the most important advertiser for digital purposes), that this site is not in the interest of the public. \n\nAs per Google\u2019s own policies regarding ads, this is a violation of their platform for several reasons. Given that they 1.Enable Dishonest Behaviour, 2. Misrepresent Information and 3. Violate Trademarks - each one of these breaches of standards would be subject to suspension by itself, let alone all together.\n\n[Google Ads\u2019 policy can be found here https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6008942?hl=en]\n\nIt is important for us to tackle these types of organizations as we want to serve as an example for other Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), which don\u2019t have the governance structure nor means to fend off these attacks.\n\nWe are in a new industry, which the public at large mischaracterizes on a daily basis. This will only change once we are able to set the precedent and stand up for ourselves. Hence, we invite other members of the crypto community, alongside our own CRD Network participants, to lend their support and build the industry that we deserve.\n\nHowever, before we are able to rally support to build this new tomorrow, we must first clear our name. \n\nNow that the allegations have been made, we will be addressing them point by point in this Proposal, so as to regain your support, actively defend against these defamatory statements and lay the groundwork for a future in which we can develop without being attacked despite being in favour of the common good.  \n\n--- DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS WITHIN THE ARTICLES ---\n\nAt first glance, the articles might seem convincing, as there are certain half-truths baked into the tale. This is necessary for a story to be believable, it must have enough elements that seem to be plausible. As such, we can\u2019t dismiss every single point outright, but we have to address them in detail and provide nuance.\n\nThe statements come in various forms but broadly speaking they fall into 3 categories:\n\n- Misunderstanding of the CRD Network\u2019s system architecture (understandable, as this is a novel technology that bears outward similarities to other systems)\n- Half-Truths, which take some bit of information and twists it to mean something else than it was originally intended\n- Outright Lies, these are demonstrably false statements.\n\nSo at the start of each section, we will add a parenthesis with the words \u201cMisunderstanding\u201d, \u201cHalf-Truth\u201d, or \u201cLie\u201d to represent the nature of the statement, and then at the end, we will tally them together to maybe try to understand the intent of the original article.\n\n1 - Misrepresentation of the relationship between CRD Network and Tacoswap community (Misunderstanding & Half-Truth)\n\nThe CRD Network pairs with influencers in order to create use cases for their respective communities via a partner company known as DLTify. In other words, influencers are provided with the resources necessary to build apps that help improve the CRD Network\u2019s DeFi offering. Tacoswap was one such use case. \n\nThis is taken to mean that the CRD Network controls the influencers, and manages the apps. This is false. \n\nAll interactions between the CRD Network and the influencer parties are governed by non-agency and non-association contracts, hence Virgo Limited (the company through which the influencers operated) is a non-member of the CRD Network. There are contractual obligations between the two parties, as one might expect (referring to profit-sharing from the app\u2019s revenue, for instance), but they\u2019re separate entities wholly responsible for their own decisions and consequences thereof. \n\n2 - Infographic summarizing the movement of funds  (Half Truth & Lie)\n\nIn the articles, there is a chart showcasing alleged financial movements within the CRD Network blockchain. \n\nWe are not here to defend third parties and leave the respective authorities to decide on the correctness of their actions. The transactions are verifiable on the blockchain, this much is true - the blockchain records all. \n\nYet, for the exact same reason, it should be obvious that the infographic is mislabelled and inadequate as the deal types and wallet movements would have vindicated our name. \n\nWe can confirm that none of those wallets belongs to the CRD Network. We know full-well whom they belong to, but data protection regulation ties our hands in regards to divulging confidential financial information regarding them, including their owner\u2019s identity.\n\nConsequently, given that the inclusion and use of the CRD Network logo implicates and associates us with the actions of implicated third parties, we view this action to be negligent incompetence at best, or willfully malicious at worst. \n\nThis would be equivalent to accusing an email provider for sending an email that may be grounds for investigation. While we try to limit the scope of pernicious actions, controlling every transaction that happens within our network would be an intolerable breach of privacy and trust for our users. \n\n3 - The CRD Network is presented as the token of an exchange platform and is alleged to not be sold anywhere except a Telegram group (Half-Truth and Lie)\n\nThe CRD Network, the company formerly known as Cryptaldash, started as an aggregator of liquidity providers and exchange flows from other centralized exchanges. So it did start as an exchange platform.\n\nNevertheless, between 2017 and now, the crypto exchanges have become centralized. As such, as of 2018, the CRD Network pivoted to be a DeFi platform that bridged the crypto and traditional fiat realms.  \n\nA cursory look at our website or any content on any platform should\u2019ve made this much clear!\n\nAs for the allegation that the CRD Token isn\u2019t available anywhere, this is a particularly strange one. The CRD Token has been available on most major decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Sushiswap since their inception, and we\u2019re constantly looking for new places to expand into, so we will soon be available on Tacoswap.\n\nIt bears mentioning that just in the Sushiswap CRD Token liquidity pool there are over $1.7m of liquidity depth  [Link to Sushiswap CRD pool https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0xd3f85d18206829f917929bbbf738c1e0ce9af7fc ]\n***\nOwing to space constraints within this platform we\u2019ve had to separate this Proposal into 3 parts.\n\nThis is [1/3], we apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nLink to [2/3]\nhttps://cutt.ly/LvQIvrU\n\nLink to [3/3]\nhttps://cutt.ly/lvQIW0n", "choices": ["ADOPT", "RESCIND"], "start": 1618740000, "end": 1619604000, "snapshot": "12266239", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3Af4ee3B6e61F8792969Ba23cCD218a033398e4d", "space": {"id": "crd.eth", "name": "CRD Network"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNzvDHbvPkz3S15wxwmEKpAvuB1hxv6a21BXuaZKLiYkf", "voter": "0xC73257eDF1fa95647353DA0263CD716F87e28974", "created": 1619084019, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmW4XT9xyybPWcMVSX9tmkFa86q7BKCdthjQUBjAnih5ep", "voter": "0x94D053F9fB2e754d50E19643680e9aBAb2d819cb", "created": 1618821657, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeeuiQRwvHPhQPz2zYSxc6Jwk2SSDnHAwfoNTZHfVNENX", "voter": "0x59c5095cA527352F94E305f9aee7E3a2c5E4757f", "created": 1618817656, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crd.eth"}}]}
