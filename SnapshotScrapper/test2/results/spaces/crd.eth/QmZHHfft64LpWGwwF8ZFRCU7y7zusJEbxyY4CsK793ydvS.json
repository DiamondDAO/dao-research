Given that the DeFi space is evolving, it is necessary to have a clear picture of what is required to not have legal issues in the area of operations.\n\nInternal decisions are made in a representative democratic manner by holders of a minimum of 100k CRD, which get a vote proportional to their financial participation in the network.\n\nThe system is hence democratic and designed to be open to all, regardless of any external traits; while prioritizing the interests of the people who have invested the most in the network\u2019s operation, as well as maintaining legal standards.\n\nHowever, before we move on though, the more perceptive of you might\u2019ve made a connection between the representative democracy and the wallets containing over 90% of outstanding CRD, these funds will be distributed as per the Wallet Distribution Proposal. \n\nRest assured that these funds aren\u2019t used to ensure compliance via the backend and stack the deck in management\u2019s favour. These \u2018inactive\u2019 CRD Tokens aren\u2019t considered within the governance decisions and are also indirectly under the stakeholder\u2019s collective control. \n\nAmong the main things that the network decision-makers will need to consider will be developing use cases. The CRD Network is, after all, a platform that allows for the development of apps with financial integration.\n", "choices": ["ADOPT", "RESCIND"], "start": 1618567200, "end": 1619344800, "snapshot": "12252693", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3Af4ee3B6e61F8792969Ba23cCD218a033398e4d", "space": {"id": "crd.eth", "name": "CRD Network"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTuTQ35xTVo8huajyPpN7D2ufjGyMLRJ9kgu2SUzp5MnQ", "voter": "0x377412c1eB82df671a7a29B73383a13900190701", "created": 1618607328, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crd.eth"}}]}
