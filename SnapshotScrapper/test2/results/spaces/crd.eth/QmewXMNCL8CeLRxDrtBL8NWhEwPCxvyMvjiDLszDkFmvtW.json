To a major extent, it has even had to fundamentally alter its business model to remain relevant in the everchanging technological landscape.\n\nYet, despite the fact that circumstances have changed how we express our intent, what hasn\u2019t changed are our fundamental beliefs. \n\nTo that end, as the CRD Network matures into a DeFi company that bridges the crypto and fiat world, we would like to share our beliefs and goals - and you can hold us to them if we happen to accidentally stray away from them in our day-to-day operations.\n\n1 - Transparency & Honesty\n\nThe CRD Network is an environment in which every participant can see every transaction that happens on the network. Transparency is built into our systems as a matter of course. \n\nHowever, being transparent is not enough to create trust. As being able to look into a system is not useful if you don\u2019t understand what is happening. Hence, at every moral crossroad, we will prioritize truth over profits.\n\nMaintaining the truth isn\u2019t just about transparency, but being forthwith and relevant with information. We won\u2019t hide behind jargon, or unnecessary complexity when addressing you.\n\nAt times, this might negatively affect us momentarily, but we think it worth it to maintain a community that believes in us. \n\n\n2 - Listen to the community and remain accountable\n\nMost of the code that comprises the CRD Network is Open-Source and endlessly duplicable. So we cannot maintain a competitive advantage with the typical things that a business might usually leverage to achieve market dominance - superior technology, high barriers to entry, etc.\n\nIn other words, we only do well when we have a large and good community that supports the ecosystem. So we can\u2019t take you for granted. You\u2019re the lifeblood of the CRD Network and because of this, we should never be in a position where we ignore your interests and concerns. \n\nWe strive to always maintain open two-way channels of communications. \n\n\n3 - Providing a stable business environment is a priority\n\nAs we mentioned in our White Paper, the CRD Token is not designed to be a token for speculation. It is meant to be a utility token that allows you to operate in the CRD Network seamlessly and with minimal volatility.\n\nTo that end, we actively seek to manage the CRD Token with the long term view of creating a financial ecosystem that is dependable and at least as stable as the value of the leading fiat currencies, such as the EUR.\n\nThe stability of the CRD to ensure a predictable business environment is a top priority.\n\n\n4 - Focus on use cases instead of flashy gimmicks\n\nTech startups, and even mature tech companies, often make the mistake of valuing a new technological application over actual utility and practicality.\n\nWhile experimentation and being willing to try never before seen things are an important part of innovation, we will err on the conservative side. After all, the CRD Network is meant to be a dependable environment wherein people transact their day-to-day finances, as well as store their valuables.\n\nSo when we incorporate a new technology into our system, it will be done after a thorough risk analysis and verifiable use case that our community would have. Instead of just changing things for the sake of changing them.\n\n\n\n5 - Maintaining trust is more important than profit\n\nWhen an organization grows, circumstances often present themselves wherein they can chip away at the accrued goodwill of their community to increase their bottom line. Many entities take this quick paycheck and over time they erode everything that made them worthwhile.\n\nWe are a community first DAO - so we believe that building and maintaining a stellar reputation is worth the cost.\n\n\n\n6 - Complex technology should be simple to use\n\nWhile the CRD Network is a cross-disciplinary system that utilizes the expertise of programmers, data scientists, economists, cryptographers and lawyers, we believe that every person should be able to use our systems, no matter their level of education.\n\nWe will endeavour to build systems that have varying levels of complexity. So each user decides what level of tolerance they have for the difficulty they engage with. \n\nBut at their core, the apps should be useable by anyone who\u2019s literate.\n\n\n\n7 - Long term thinking leads to better results\n\nStartups often prioritize fast growth over stable growth. It\u2019s much quicker to create a pile of bricks than it is to build a house. Yet only one of the two structures will survive the test of time.\n\nThe CRD Network will favour stable growth over the long term, instead of fast and unstable growth that likely leads to systemic crashes.\n\n\n\n8 - Marketing is no substitute for usability\n\nThe average startup spends 40% of its capital on marketing for customer acquisition and brand awareness. We believe this is the wrong way to approach matters.\n\nMarketing is important, but it shouldn\u2019t be the main expense in a tech platform. Solving problems should be the priority. If one solves problems that various communities have, word of mouth will do much more to build awareness than any marketing campaign. \n\n\n9 - If it\u2019s legal and ethical it should be allowed on our platform\n\nMany of the existing dominant tech platforms nowadays spend too much time policing the behaviours of their users. They become moral arbiters, wherein they enforce their version of what is right or shut them off completely from their platforms.\n\nThis goes counter to the principles of accessibility and uses that we want to achieve in the CRD Network. We will endeavour to remain a politically neutral platform, insofar as is possible. However, we will also address any infringement of the principles of good behaviour between users.\n\n\n\n10 - Learn from your mistakes\n\n\nAs aspirational as all these beliefs and goals are, we will occasionally fail to meet them. Hindsight is often necessary to see where a decision ultimately took you. But if a mistake has been done, it is necessary to acknowledge it and course correct.\n\nWe are still human, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t strive to be better. And we hope that in time we can design systems that improve the lives of every person in the world.\n", "choices": ["ADOPT", "DENY"], "start": 1618596000, "end": 1619344800, "snapshot": "125000000", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3Af4ee3B6e61F8792969Ba23cCD218a033398e4d", "space": {"id": "crd.eth", "name": "CRD Network"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXHp1RLH9HHjeJCkUdoyySz4orNVq7BU2V8rMof2iCs4U", "voter": "0x377412c1eB82df671a7a29B73383a13900190701", "created": 1618607545, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPwYHabhJxP5nN9ToHkYbjSY9QYNtFtjcfDTpGHqetfeW", "voter": "0xc9F59B32a88F732D66a4A96b442c215c94F34547", "created": 1618606724, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmP1cNdDeeHBsCNbjftqs79SRmL9fzkpeNmKEKXL6NMEjQ", "voter": "0x9C654251CE4c0791Cb4a4289210FE73762f90c4d", "created": 1618606205, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crd.eth"}}]}
