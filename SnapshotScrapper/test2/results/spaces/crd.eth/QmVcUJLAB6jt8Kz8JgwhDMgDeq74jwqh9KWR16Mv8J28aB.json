But at least our rudimentary tally would seem to indicate that there might have been at least some willful obfuscation of the truth, or the journalists might have been misled by their anonymous sources. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly logical why purported news sites might be willing to give the benefit of the doubt to unvetted sources - drama sells. Furthermore, unlike when you defame traditional organizations, writing poorly sourced statements about crypto-projects will get you clicks, but it\u2019s unlikely to lead to any court proceedings.\n\nHence this is a means by which you can write clickbait with the veneer of truth and journalism, but without actually having to be rigorous about the sources.\n\nDespite the active defence of our cause, we bear no grudge towards the journalists. We believe that there is a good chance that they might have been misled by those with short selling contracts against the CRD Token and thus would greatly benefit from a news organization libelling us.\n\nHowever, we do want to clear our name, which is why we are making a Proposal regarding the publishers of this material. We would like a retraction of the piece and would be glad to set the record straight if given the chance. \n\nWe gladly invite the press to make contact with us via our email: press@crdtoken.org\n\n\n\n--- A SPECIAL NOTE ON INFLUENCER PAIRING ---\n\nOne of the key operating goals of the CRD Network is to find use cases that communities actually want to use. Far too many startups design technology without having a clear audience in mind.\n\nWe think this is the wrong way of looking at things. So we\u2019ve decided to partner with community leaders to build technology that uses the CRD Network and thereby we both benefit. The influencers receive the means of building their own business, while we gain network users.\n\nIt sounds like an ideal set of circumstances - and it is if everything works right - but this is the real world we\u2019re dealing with. Due to the rapid nature of our scaling, we\u2019re bound to accidentally pair up with people that in hindsight might not have been the best fit.\n\nFurthermore, if you\u2019ve ever looked at social media, drama is more or less guaranteed if you even indirectly associate with an influencer. So, unfortunately, some of that drama will occasionally fall back on us, despite our best intentions.\n\nDepending on the severity of this drama we might be forced to cut ties with particular influencers. But this will happen on a case by case basis. \n\nAlong with the WACEO, we are creating best practice guidelines so that this will not happen in future. We will shortly be releasing those guidelines, so as to best protect the CRD Network going forward.\n\nHowever, for now, suffice it to say that any future influencer that pairs with us will have to, at a minimum, meet these two primary criteria:\n\n- An evaluation of fitness and properness\n- Strict adherence to best practices\n\nAt its core though, we remain convinced of the validity of this business model, as we are able to reach a community that we might not have been able to reach otherwise. The CRD Network is about empowering the individual, no matter their provenance. \n\nAnd so we\u2019re glad of being able to serve and educate a growing pool of people from all manner of backgrounds. We are excited about the future, and we hope you are as well!\n\n--- OUR ROLE IN THE FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY ---\n\nAs pioneers in the industry, we have faced many obstacles to develop. This is just one of many challenges that we are bound to face and overcome. \n\nHowever, we have always prioritized the interests of the CRD stakeholders. As our community grows, and the major stakeholders change, we are likely to face new regulatory frameworks that we will have to adhere to. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t apply to just us, but the crypto industry as a whole. And thus it is essential that we are proactive with establishing good relations with lawmakers and regulators to build a business environment that promotes the common good and provides DAOs a legal standing via the WACEO. \n\nThe CRD Network is pioneering the distribution process, capital formation process and the legal formation of the DAOs as legal entities. Our actions today will have a ripple effect on the industry as a whole and so we must not only act for our wellbeing, but the precedents we set for everyone that follows.\n\nThis is partially why the CRD Network is a strong proponent for the WACEO, and its role in creating regulatory frameworks, as they can represent us to legislators from the vantage point of experience and providing justice to innovating entities, rather than misinformation and misunderstanding.\n\nWhat we do today, will colour the future that is to come for everyone in the industry. So we must be careful with this implicit responsibility that has been entrusted to us. \n\n--- ACTION PLAN ---\n\nAs stated before, we bear no ill will towards the journalists. We believe that there is good reason to suspect that they were misled by actors who have bet against the financial success of the CRD Network by short selling their tokens.\n\nHence, if all the Proposals below are passed, this would broadly be our plan of operations with increasing remedial steps:\n\nI. Ask for a retraction and apology by the publishers of this unfortunate libellous attack and provide them with a 15 day grace period to do so.\nII. If no correction is issued, assign legal representation in the US and EU to make a case to Google and associated monetization parties enabling the misinformation to propagate, to drop the publishers as clients and thereby have them lose access to advertising.\nIII. If no remedy is to be found through these means, we will pursue the matter to the full extent of the applicable law, in all evoked jurisdictions, against the publishers of this misinformation, along with the individual short-sellers who initiated the libel campaign, as they both jointly profited from the ensuing reputational loss by the CRD Network. There is a clear case to be made with the available information that they have profited from libel, which is a crime in the relevant jurisdictions. However, we will first pursue their monetization features, chiefly by flagging their behaviour to their advertisers, as we believe this was the main motivator behind aiding and abetting these abuses.\n\n--- PROPOSAL ---\n\nDue to all the points that we have mentioned in prior sections, we believe that we have been the victim of an orchestrated libel campaign to profit from our reputational loss, as we were perceived to be unable to retaliate in kind. \n\nFurthermore, due to how our founder\u2019s Moroccan background was framed and awkwardly wedged in the article as if to imply, but not outright say, something about his moral character we believe that this might also be motivated by what in the Francophone communities is called d\u00e9lit de faci\u00e8s, or \u201cface offence\u201d.\n\nIf we are to protect our community, and indeed the industry as a whole, from any such further malicious attacks we must defend ourselves, make an example of this attack and set a standard, for us, and for the whole industry.\n\nWe want to be the DAO that fights back, which champions against the abuses and injustices of existing practices. But we can\u2019t do it alone.\n\nTo that end, we will be following the governing and educational principles set forth by https://firstdraftnews.org/ a non-profit which seeks to protect communities from harmful misinformation. And we also need your help\u2026\n\nWe submit to you four proposals up for a vote, which we will enact as soon as we receive community approval to do so. \n\n1 -  Demand a correction by the editors as proven by the points above within the next 15 days following the adoption of this proposal.\n2 - Nominate WACEO to be able to choose and direct legal representation in the USA and EU;\n3 - Allocate 10m CRD (c.$140k) to be used for legal fees related to the pursuit of claiming damage. These fees will be paid in accordance to the Dev fund policies; and\n4 - Any financial restitution from punitive action caused by the defamatory content will be used to repurchase CRDs and thereby be disbursed back to the community through an increased CRD Token valuation.\n\nThe CRD Network will continue to explore and develop technology that broadens the financial capacity of all, no matter their background, creed or education level. We believe in interacting with people in the way that they talk, through social media and frank discussions. \n\nMost important all though believe in open access to technology, and lies will not stop us from pursuing that truth. \n\nWe reiterate our invitation to the press to make contact with us via our email: press@crdtoken.org\n\n\n***\nOwing to space constraints within this platform we\u2019ve had to separate this Proposal into 3 parts. \n\nThis is [3/3], we apologize for the inconvenience.", "choices": ["ADOPT", "RESCIND"], "start": 1618740000, "end": 1619604000, "snapshot": "12265878", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3Af4ee3B6e61F8792969Ba23cCD218a033398e4d", "space": {"id": "crd.eth", "name": "CRD Network"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmdpr43sSUvc9RETcviRSt9WmJSYnJo6ZuTT5dUAFFKRui", "voter": "0xC73257eDF1fa95647353DA0263CD716F87e28974", "created": 1619084155, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crd.eth"}}]}
