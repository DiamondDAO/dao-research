{"id": "QmcAyyrMT72y9EreMtse1fmwSRNR7gibqd2qzDf22immuw", "title": "[2/3] RESPONSE ON FRANCOPHONE MEDIA ATTACK AND DAMAGE RESTITUTION PROPOSAL", "body": "Owing to space constraints within this platform we\u2019ve had to separate this Proposal into 3 parts. \n\nThis is [2/3], we apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nLink to [3/3]\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/crd.eth/proposal/QmVcUJLAB6jt8Kz8JgwhDMgDeq74jwqh9KWR16Mv8J28aB\n***\n\n4 - Three addresses own over 90% of the CRDs in the contract (Misinterpretation, Half-truth and Lie)\n\nYes. This much is true and we make no secrets about it. We said in the White Paper that the CRD tokens are pre-minted and there is a firm cap of 1bn CRDs.  \n\nThe implication that this is some uncovered secret is spurious and extremely misleading as to our intent. Especially given that this is publicly available information. The CRD Token is primarily used for operating in DeFi, it\u2019s an access/utility token, so wild fluctuations aren\u2019t good for our goals. As such, the distribution of the token is actively supervised and follows a strict set of guidelines before its disbursed in any form. \n\nFurthermore, we\u2019ve publicly stated the wallet addresses and explained their purposes on other occasions.[LINK - https://snapshot.org/#/crd.eth/proposal/QmVtHZHzsM99riqvq7Cwc44HNCb2x77Wv65ou1jLPrXXvK ] Nevertheless, for the sake of thoroughness, this was the Wallets\u2019 state as of the 13th of April 2021:\n\n[Wallet 1- no public tag] - PURPOSE: Reserve Fund, Dev Team,Operations Fund, Settlement Payments - #CRDs 702.19m - 0xa5a6707dbad87609c8b21270653e7a0490e9bf21\n\n[Wallet 2 - no public tag] - PURPOSE: A Smart contract of people staking in TacoSwap - #CRDs 145.058m - 0x7f7710e0c7c5c0ff043963dd22c3988e8bdb7acc\n\nPublic Tag:\u201dSushiSwap: CRD\u201d - PURPOSE: SushiSwap Liquidity Pool - #CRDs 61.331m - 0xcaaa93712bdac37f736c323c93d4d5fdefcc31cc\n\nWallet 1 was the genesis wallet of the CRD Token program. Meaning that it is logical that it would contain the largest portion of CRD Tokens, given that this is where the initially minted tokens were deposited. \n\nOnce the related wallet Proposal has passed it will be divided up into multi-sig wallets with variable purposes, each with a separate utility in the business purpose, as follows:\n\nI - Public Tag: \u201cCRD Dev Fund\u201d - #CRDs 100m - 0x4957871EDAEBDe721364e2038bfD142e23D85F55\n\nII - Public Tag: \u201cCRD DAO Operations Fund\u201d - #CRDs 80m - 0xa08DBE4FC76d2E72C3eAFC7f282D8C3D213A6000\n\nIII - Public Tag: \u201cFounding team allocation vested in 2019\u201d - #CRDs 100m - 0xc6951842CF1E79FcDC37348B1aEbeb68AD391b99\n\nIV - Public Tag:\u201dCRD DAO Reserve Funds and misc\u201d [Status: Locked] - #CRDs 422m - 0xEA01645548f37D63B48d4226C1b489c13F1f4519\n\nMost of these funds will not be utilized for the foreseeable future. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that [Wallet 2] and SushiSwap: CRD are not directly under the CRD Network\u2019s control as they remain locked in liquidity pool Smart Contracts.\n\nEach disbursement from the wallets must comply with the Dev Fund use policy agreed by the CRD Network stakeholders. \n\n5 - ALLEGATION \u201can error in the Cryptaldash source code that allows founders to create as many new CRDs as they want\u201d (Lie)\n\nThis is demonstrably false, as you can check by following the instructions below. But even assuming that were the case, there would be nothing to be gained from exercising said glitch.\n\nInstantly doubling the supply of CRD would be impossible to hide. Furthermore, present and foreseeable demand in the medium term for the CRD Token simply would not be able to cope with such a massive oversupply. In other words, even if it were done and by some miracle, nobody noticed and we tried to sell them all at once, it would permanently crash the price. \n\nIt bears saying that the CRD Network is so concerned with price fluctuations that all holders that have above 1m CRD are subject to an anti-dumping agreement [LINK https://snapshot.org/#/crd.eth/proposal/QmU5NBUEiog9UUNPyMhEXLxgwRXTFRRdd1VJQGPW7z5Fw5 ].\n\nThe minting function of the contract has been inactive since 2018 and the contract has been closed for minting as well. You can easily check for yourself. Follow the Etherscan link below and then go to the tab CONTRACT > READ CONTRACT > 1.mintingFinished then you\u2019ll see \u201cTrue bool\u201d which means that code has been executed. [https://etherscan.io/address/0xcaaa93712bdac37f736c323c93d4d5fdefcc31cc#readContract]\n\nPut simply, this allegation does not work either from an execution standpoint, or from a practical standpoint as the net effect would harm the CRD Network more than it would benefit us. \n\nFor it to even have a chance of working we would already need to have a very robust user base and be willing to instantly destroy our years of hard work for what is even in the best of circumstances a bad tradeoff.\n\n6 - Alleged intentions to deceive about implied associations with Dash (Lies)\n\nThe articles purport that the CRD Network, or rather its prior Cryptaldash iteration, claimed association with the Dash organization, which is in charge of the operations of Dash (a digital currency). No such association has ever taken place, nor have we ever claimed that there was one.\n\nEarly iterations of the business did intend to offer liquidity pairs of Dash in the original Cryptaldash exchange but this never happened, nor was it ever earnestly attempted. Hence barring superficial name similarities in the initial inception of the business, there\u2019s no association, nor was this ever claimed to be the case. \n\n7 - Allegation \u201cThe CRD project site has many shortcomings, except for the affiliation part.\u201d (LIE, WE HAVE THE BEST WEBSITE EVER)\n\nOur web developer has been summarily fired upon reading this...\n\nJokes aside, we are working on our website and improving it constantly. That said, we don\u2019t have an affiliation section at all, nor do we have an affiliate program, so this is certainly a strange criticism.\n\nWe welcome the journalist to supply information about this alleged affiliate program.\n\n8 -  Misinformation on Founder Amine Larhrib (Lie)\n\nDespite being a rather short section of the overall piece, it gets a lot of basic biographical details wrong. \n\nFor example, he did not move to Marbella in 2017 to start Cryptaldash. At the time he was still living in Hong Kong. It wasn\u2019t until 2019 that he moved to Marbella as he wanted to live closer to the regulatory seat of DLTify, a technology firm he owns, which is in Gibraltar.\n\nThe section also goes out of its way to make it seem as if Amine has disappeared from the internet. We can only speculate what they mean by this profile wedged amidst unsavoury dealings of people who\u2019ve run away with assets entrusted to them. But despite not being journalists ourselves, we at least have the journalistic integrity to not extrapolate on mere speculation.\n\nHowever, the CRD Network Founder Amine Larhrib is still very much active and visible on social media. For instance, he is posting weekly Linkedin articles on a variety of topics, including entrepreneurship, cryptocurrency, technology and economics, etc.\n\n[Link to articles https://bit.ly/3drCR6r]\n\n\n9 - Regarding Tacoswap (Half-Truths and Lies)\n\nTacoSwap is a decentralized exchange app built by DLTify which is based on the source code of Sushiswap, which itself is built on the source code of Uniswap. It is true that one of the main ways planned to attract users is by staging what is commonly referred to as \u201ca vampire attack.\u201d\n\nDespite the sinister-sounding name, what this means is simply offering higher yields on staked assets to participants in a rival system. It\u2019s a common growth strategy in the industry, and the organization it was aimed at - Sushiswap - first grew by doing the same thing to Uniswap.\n\nTacoswap is only partially linked to the CRD Network in that it utilizes CRD Tokens as access tokens, but they\u2019re not exclusive to it, as you can use Ethereum, Sushi Tokens, LP tokens, etc.\n\nPresently it has its own growing community, as can be found on its Telegram group. \n\n10 - Statements related to WACEO Organization (Misinterpretations, Half-Truths and Lies)\n\nThis section described the WACEO as a non-profit organization designed to help entities in the DeFi space be regulatory compliant. So far so good.\n\nHowever, then it begins to craft a tale wherein it was supposedly the brainchild of one of the paired influencers. This is false, the CRD Network pairing with influencers is a recent strategy, so much so that we are still compiling the best-practices guidelines given some distasteful initial experiences.\n\nThe WACEO predates the influencer program by almost half a decade. \n\nPresently, the WACEO is tasked with overseeing the development of DAOs from a regulatory framework and providing legal aid to members of the organization. \n\nIt is admittedly a curious state of affairs wherein the WACEO is overseeing the actions of the CRD Network - both of which have been implicitly controlled by Mr Amine Larhrib. This happened because of his pioneering attempt to better understand the requirements for providing the regulatory framework from both ends.\n\nThe WACEO grew and pivoted alongside Cryptaldash, and then the CRD Network. This organizational structure was borne out of necessity, owing to sparse resources and still being a new player in the market.\n\nNevertheless, this has rightfully beckoned the criticism that WACEO might not be a neutral organization. This is a fair reproval now that WACEO has gained expertise, and is staffed by various legal professionals. \n\nAs we grow as an organization and in order to gain the public\u2019s trust we must eliminate any potential conflict of interests. To that effect, Amine Larhrib will step down as WACEO Director and take a less immediate role in the day to day operations of said organization. \n\nFurthermore, in order to position itself to be able to operate effectively, WACEO will restructure its governance board to guarantee independence from any undue influences. Therefore, the CRD Network will retain its WACEO membership. \n\n***\nOwing to space constraints within this platform we\u2019ve had to separate this article into 3 parts. \n\nThis is [2/3], we apologize for the inconvenience.\n\n", "choices": ["ADOPT", "RESCIND"], "start": 1618740000, "end": 1619604000, "snapshot": "12266149", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3Af4ee3B6e61F8792969Ba23cCD218a033398e4d", "space": {"id": "crd.eth", "name": "CRD Network"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmP1gBb937u1SUYZS8dsa8e4KGii9FwWibHpRJvAokoaCH", "voter": "0x377412c1eB82df671a7a29B73383a13900190701", "created": 1619204845, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crd.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVT21zuKALQqR12KBLepme6SibimUdMTPBVfqUFxMTcPT", "voter": "0xC73257eDF1fa95647353DA0263CD716F87e28974", "created": 1619084092, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "crd.eth"}}]}
