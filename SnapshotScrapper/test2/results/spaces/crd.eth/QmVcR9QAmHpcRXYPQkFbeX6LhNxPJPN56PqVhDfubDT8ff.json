While it is the full intention of the CRD Network to restrain these funds, there are some transactions that need to happen beforehand.\n\nFollowing the disbursement for the purposes highlighted below, the remainder of the Reserve Funds will be restricted and subject to the Dev Fund Distribution Policies:\n\n* Pending withdrawals from Cryptaldash Exchange occurring between 2018-2020 // projected at 60m CRD\n* Legal fees pertaining to francophone media attack // 10m CRD\n* WACEO membership and LAR associated costs // 5m CRD\n\nThe allocation of these funds will occur within the next 30 days following the adoption of this Proposal. \n\nSUBSEQUENT TO THE MISC DISTRIBUTION OF RESERVE FUNDS\n\nUpon allocating the pending transactions of the Reserve Fund, the wallet and the remaining funds will be planned to be used for two primary purposes, subject to the Dev Fund Policies:\n\n* A capital allocation hub to bootstrap projects deployed on the CRD Network;\n* A depositary of burnt tokens, to limit the available supply. \n\nIn other words, while the wallet will mainly remain inactive, any future movements of these funds will be subject to the adoption of future Proposals pertaining to them. \n\nThe primary concern of the Core Team is to ensure the long term stability of the operating environment and will use any tool at its disposal to enact this mandate. \n***\n\nNOTE ON PUBLIC TAGS\n\nThe CRD Network has officially requested Etherscan Public Tags for all the highlighted wallets that we have mentioned previously in our documentation. Nevertheless, that procedure remains pending, we will issue an announcement when there is a relevant update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "choices": ["ADOPT", "RESCIND"], "start": 1620122400, "end": 1620727200, "snapshot": "12323143", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3Af4ee3B6e61F8792969Ba23cCD218a033398e4d", "space": {"id": "crd.eth", "name": "CRD Network"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
