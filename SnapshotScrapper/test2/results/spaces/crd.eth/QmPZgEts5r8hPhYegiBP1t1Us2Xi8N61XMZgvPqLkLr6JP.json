This is part [2/2], please go to the CRD Network front-page proposal section for the first part of this proposal. \n\nCRD Network Proposals - https://snapshot.org/#/crd.eth\n***\n\n\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\n\nPresently the operating philosophy under which policies regarding the CRD Network are designed is to develop use cases of the technology to increase demand while limiting the supply of the pre-minted 1bn CRD. \n\nThrough this induced scarcity, the price will trend upwards from its current free-float state, until a CRD can have approximate price level stability with EUR. \n\nThereafter, policies will be enacted with the purpose of maintaining this apparent peg to the EUR; chief among our monetary policies is limiting or increasing the supply of CRD depending on the direction in which we require the price to move in order to maintain price level stability.\n\nIt bears saying though that network operability is prioritized over maintenance of the pre-agreed exchange range, and thus, while actively managed and with aspirations to be a stable currency, it will remain in free-float.\n\nThe governance of the CRD Network is done via two layers:\n\nThe WACEO, a non-profit organization, maintains the organizational and regulatory requirements.\nInternal decisions are made in a representative democratic manner by holders of a minimum of 1k CRD, which get a vote proportional to their financial participation in the network - they\u2019re the agents within the system that indirectly finance its operation and ensure the infrastructure stability.\n\nThe system is hence democratic and designed to be open to all, regardless of any external traits; while prioritizing the interests of the people who have invested the most in the network\u2019s operations, as well as maintaining legal standards.\n\nHowever, before we move on though, the more perceptive of you might\u2019ve made a connection between the representative democracy and the wallets containing over 90% of outstanding CRD, these funds will be distributed as per the Dev Fund Disbursement policies.  \n\nRest assured that these funds aren\u2019t used to ensure compliance via the backend and stack the deck in management\u2019s favour. These \u2018inactive\u2019 CRD Tokens aren\u2019t considered within the governance decisions and are also indirectly under the stakeholder\u2019s collective control. \n\nAmong the main things that the network decision-makers will need to consider will be developing use cases. The CRD Network is, after all, a platform that allows for the development of apps with financial integration.\n\nCURRENT LEADERSHIP AND ACCESSION OF MANAGEMENT\n\nThe CRD Network is a DAO, hence important matters are put to a vote wherein network participants get votes proportional to their holdings. Nevertheless, for the day-to-day operations of the organization, the managerial functions are done by the Core Leaders. \n\nThe Core Leaders, which are jointly known as the \u201cCore Team\u201d, are the heads of given sections of the CRD\u2019s operations. \n\n At present, there is the Developer Core, Operations Core, Technical Core and the Business Development Core. However, this is subject to increase depending on the remit provided by the passed Proposals.\n\nIf the existing community votes for a Proposal requiring the participation of a community member, they are to be incorporated as a Core Leader, and their associates are to be considered as another Core Team, for as long as their Proposal mandate lasts; or until the Proposal is nullified through the ratification of successive Proposals stating as such. \n\nThe Core Team members are the primary organizations or people who can issue Proposals, along with those whom they have vested with the authority to do so. \n\nNevertheless, if a member of the community wishes to issue a Proposal to be put under consideration of the CRD Network Stakeholders, they are to contact the Core team members and they will submit it for them. \n\nRIGHTS & RESPONSIBILITIES OF NETWORK STAKEHOLDERS\n\nEvery project and operation done within the CRD Network is subject to the CRD NETWORK POLICY ON TECH PROJECTS [LINK https://snapshot.org/#/crd.eth/proposal/QmWNscMcYHg3kr5ebcdSm8z1Z3AZtfqTBnu5AXXRqFEkm7]. This is colloquially referred to as the \u201cDev fund policy\u201d, and it limits the disbursement of funds unless they adhere to: \n\n* The governance of the tech project policies\n* The progression of the tech project policies\n* Best practices of billing.\n\nOn an individual user basis though, we also have a set of policies that must be followed beyond our behavioural guidelines, and Terms and Conditions. Given our commitment towards long term price stability and reducing momentary volatility, all CRD investors with holdings over 1m CRD are subject to an anti-dumping and market disruption policy [LINK https://snapshot.org/#/crd.eth/proposal/QmU5NBUEiog9UUNPyMhEXLxgwRXTFRRdd1VJQGPW7z5Fw5].\n\nIn short, what this agreement seeks to accomplish is to safeguard our network participants and third-party app developers and operators from variable price hikes for basic operations. Consequently, large holders wishing to divest from their CRD holdings have to do so in a controlled manner, so as to minimize market volatility.\n\nFinally, users are required to adhere to the respective policy Proposals that have been ratified by the CRD Network community. These Proposals can be found on the CRD Network\u2019s Snapshot, as well as the CRD Token website. \n\nSTAKEHOLDER CONFLICT RESOLUTION\n\nAll relevant conflicts between network participants can be addressed via the internal mediation protocols. Nevertheless, if a mutually satisfactory solution is not to be found, there are various levels of conflict resolution, which include arbitration and court proceedings. \n\nSubsequent to our accession as a full-time member of the WACEO, any relevant dispute between users which cannot be remedied through the internal operational procedures will be subject to WACEO mediation, followed by the aforementioned dispute resolution protocols.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe CRD Network is unlike many other cryptocurrency projects out there, from its pre-minted currency to its free-floating potential stability with a major fiat currency, and its desire to enable technology in the cryptocurrency and fiat realm.\n\nConsequently, it has some particular traits that are only to be found within the CRD Network and quite unlike other Blockchain projects. Nevertheless, while its distinct characteristics require some unique propositions, above all else the CRD Network is designed to be a DeFi environment that is accountable, transparent and with compliance with existing regulatory guidelines. \n\nThis is partially done through its ongoing partnership with the WACEO. \n\n***\nDue to character restrictions on Snapshot, we have separated this proposal into two separate parts. This is part [2/2], please go to the CRD Network front-page proposal section for the first part of this proposal. \n\nCRD Network Proposals - https://snapshot.org/#/crd.eth\n", "choices": ["ADOPT", "RESCIND"], "start": 1620036000, "end": 1620640800, "snapshot": "12317315", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3Af4ee3B6e61F8792969Ba23cCD218a033398e4d", "space": {"id": "crd.eth", "name": "CRD Network"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
