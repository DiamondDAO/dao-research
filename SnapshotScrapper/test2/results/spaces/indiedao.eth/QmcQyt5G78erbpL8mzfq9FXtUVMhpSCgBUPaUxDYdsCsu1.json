This includes a definition for each tier within our application-gated Discord community and will allow new partners to add relevant contributions and talent to our Indie ecosystem.\n\n# Motivation\t\n\nIn order to become the best freelance network in the world, we believe that talent exists on the fringes of the networks and people that we currently know. We believe that IndieDAO will be supported in a more sustainable way by opening up our access points.\n\nThis Community Access Proposal is specifically designed to be an onramp for non-members to join, which will allow them to experience the IndieDAO in a low-risk way before making the commitment of being a member. This also is the opportunity for our existing members to signal yea/nay voting for new hand-raisers.\n\n# Specifications\n\nWe will start with an onboarding document walkthrough that new members can follow (similar to index coop\u2019s model), where new members can follow a series of check-list items and upon completion, send in a feedback form where you can self-report completing these actions.\n\nWe are looking for designers, developers & indie strategists to join at this phase.\n\n## New member onboarding\nProvided [on our GitBook](https://indiedao.gitbook.io/indiedao/), new members will be able to go through an onboarding checklist with the following:\n1. Fill out the [IndieDAO Application](https://form.typeform.com/to/RwYVI0WL)\n2. Join the Discord Channel\n3. Attend a live new member orientation call to join Vibe Check\n4. Engage in Introductions, Pointers, & News\n5. Share something in *#Pointers* to level others up\n6. Follow IndieDAO across the socials\n7. Create a Level Profile\n8. Demo Your Skills or Teach People Something\n9. Complete the feedback form\n\nWe will also reconfigure our Discord to reflect the stages of community membership, from lurker to convoy member, ordered by significance of contribution to the community.\n\nOur tiered community membership will consist of:\n- `Core Team` for initial founders of the DAO\n- `Convoy` for specific leaders and core contributors in the DAO\n- `Indies` for those who have completed all steps of onboarding. If you own $INDIE, you will be able to vote on governance topics.\n- `Vibe Check` for those currently going through onboarding\n- `Lurkers` for those checking out IndieDAO before they initiate onboarding\n\nFor a more comprehensive outline of how these members can interact with the DAO, please review the following table:\n\n![members table](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQDooKRvAzPewLjKcnf8jXwKwr1gz6N7igciivnXdRkGh)\n\nOur channel architecture will also need to be updated to include:\n- `Welcome` category with the check-list and any relevant question\n- `Introductions` for current DAO members to learn about new members\n- `New-Members` for members to join an orientation call and ask questions\n\n# Vote\n1. Yes - Implement Community Access Proposal\n2. No - Do Not Implement Community Access Proposal\n\n", "choices": ["YES", "NO"], "start": 1635073200, "end": 1635332400, "snapshot": "13480905", "state": "closed", "author": "0xe0C695803a7cAEaF66d71cb76EA40f815AE465f2", "space": {"id": "indiedao.eth", "name": "IndieDAO"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x15af60a6b3b3110edc16720900960909c638f132d567a08a81f694f8f8e6bc16", "voter": "0xaa678Df45D3aD01fDf664E57F91dEdf47fE986bD", "created": 1635287489, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "indiedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmReMQrhz6shGQpZ66RD7qq1GWtpD44thL8mpp3vQuTfYv", "voter": "0xe0C695803a7cAEaF66d71cb76EA40f815AE465f2", "created": 1635256353, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "indiedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmThdrf8xQdALrxtdQJnfVnqsnLSScxRp6j1Ww1E7Q29Wy", "voter": "0xe1DEE1Ce90Ab7e5Ba7f25d3e1377c2c14c9f4833", "created": 1635229383, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "indiedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUDFEdapkF38DzPNeeFrYjz2Xi3yPoFyZ4ErjhmAtUDSM", "voter": "0xA8Af7b5BdC155b747D7e903024fcBEd0126f5B72", "created": 1635183536, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "indiedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWFDU9jv3vumrX7RQyuwV2o77VkMJu2R85xR6RjQtqUVK", "voter": "0x9B7F75357754BE975B1f73f3617399E0C29aa0Cd", "created": 1635179535, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "indiedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaP15Jg8bCWxnsZ5Si31T3g8ofV1MBaoqLXn5tvfxEyXv", "voter": "0x8269075052519998da747c5B048aBFD1f4A7987f", "created": 1635177814, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "indiedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfG8fcDpEeb5AZG3kbJHvJZffugQ8qbmoyKPKNEPmMzH4", "voter": "0x1B8ef73D83DC89Da0163D5bD2AB8c225a55bD61a", "created": 1635176865, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "indiedao.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf9BRZqaXWcdZaVYGRHMemTnYRUxrNV1a7sax9tZ6ALUb", "voter": "0x6107E341e1F93aF3E32fdE1a104BD39FbAD1e30e", "created": 1635174673, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "indiedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTdCkWs3CXR8xVdHgUVKSZAyTNKV9JGRYPhVLuQmwADby", "voter": "0x99b9bB23D300Dda4A1dC9eb8d2333704b235c165", "created": 1635172744, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "indiedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYpu4XMgJKVAGfv2GkmbWZhwp4uNZaQstkpJ6Rog71KwV", "voter": "0xb7e374B882fc6B79543A8f4B107bfe2Ca6317629", "created": 1635168444, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "indiedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbkUUgzgptXNn39bbxSsdTT7o4A1FY2HEvvUTgG3wM1Yx", "voter": "0x3E259685A7b778dE2a8DbdF836659c4011cCAb9e", "created": 1635137660, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "indiedao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSJbn1GApCLuTz4dymv5LWPDAUcxbsPHtKotJSW7jSJyK", "voter": "0xEB0545F8B921d0D685D4e08Fb4B6154355C97B5c", "created": 1635098554, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "indiedao.eth"}}]}
