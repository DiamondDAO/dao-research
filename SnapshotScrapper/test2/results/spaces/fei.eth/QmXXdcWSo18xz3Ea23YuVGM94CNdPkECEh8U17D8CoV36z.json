Two of the most important features of a stablecoin are 1) stability to its peg 2) user trust that this peg will always be maintained.\n\nThe primary mechanism that FEI uses to maintain its $1.00 peg are reweights. When FEI is trading at less than $0.995 on the FEI-ETH pair on Uniswap V2, the protocol will \u201creweight\u201d the price by buying enough FEI to bring the price up to $1.00. This process currently occurs as often as every 4 hours.\n\nFei has an additional peg maintenance mechanism that is much less frequently used, the reserve stabilizer backstop. This mechanism allows each unit of FEI to be redeemed for $0.95 of ETH. This mechanism was implemented in FIP-2.\n\nSince the protocol is continually growing stronger, it is time to consider raising this backstop from $0.95 to $0.99, much closer to the peg value of $1.00. This would give a strong signal to potential users that the protocol is able to maintain its peg.\n\n## Advantages:\n- Increased confidence in FEI by current FEI users, prospective FEI users, and users of integrating protocols\n- Every FEI redeemed through the reserve stabilizer still earns the protocol a fee, because the redemption value is lower than the face value of $1.00\n\n## Disadvantages:\n- Could leave FEI more sensitive to stale oracle attacks\n\n# Voting Rules\nVoting will last 2 days. This is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThe two options to vote on are:\n1. Yes, raise reserve stabilizer backstop to $0.99\n2. No, leave reserve stabilizer backstop at $0.95\n\nThis is a single choice vote, if Yes wins with greater than 50% approval and 10M TRIBE quorum, the proposal will be submitted to the DAO ", "choices": ["Yes, raise backstop to $0.99", "No, leave backstop at $0.95"], "start": 1629827100, "end": 1629999900, "snapshot": "13089427", "state": "closed", "author": "0xC64Ed730e030BdCB66E9B5703798bb4275A5a484", "space": {"id": "fei.eth", "name": "Fei"}, "votes": 17, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmT5FXkRMAe7kit53parSZBJchjmm6UzYUMpofiPqhzL9q", "voter": "0x1083D7254E01beCd64C3230612BF20E14010d646", "created": 1629992045, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZHsQ6u9qjzYfZQVigM6fbgzEQYX8LLtugEa5Vymymu8m", "voter": "0x294388d7f62065784666F797ca6919a4B8CeF4ab", "created": 1629990016, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPQRzkNkfv8XgtcL9TdLcD6XVVr4XFAvz7toYkYtA5Gpo", "voter": "0x685513Ba45Df3496026f78dD264Df5f6777e4dB3", "created": 1629980312, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSYCLkehAtGKpYYoq9ijPZvEDjQoffxAyafnxtRdx7pCD", "voter": "0xEd20d792D027957F2FBF606b575fdFC6d85112af", "created": 1629970132, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRNouF4j8YjS583Y3w8phwQJhuL5yWZ2tPcA1VwrfPCir", "voter": "0x01dB881D4638D542d53d58b35a34557ce4E561C7", "created": 1629963562, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbXPD6tv7YCVLm2xZFehkCVdPyyBaA655PJyi2zVii9vt", "voter": "0x59EC0EDb51AB373C94E1f93FA3CDAAa94AAE582b", "created": 1629961884, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTUv6v3rKGLnat4x9yE1KJa48KbB5TtU6ab66wvUHCgzs", "voter": "0x7558899d8109D8a2CE457837ADE56C3d6eBFE90d", "created": 1629960169, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXz6F1tTmuNSW4knSNsoHiXt7iQ4gbu4rtFRDCA3QdoDp", "voter": "0xa74E37eC36E5257a5861DE457fE8a60BDA7E7C7a", "created": 1629926152, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbbRjiaLhdaHoPnRNJf1B2SL66NUTiDo47F3rEQasxjqQ", "voter": "0x6F1B12a415E035eEbDc8559130eA8bdb96ADd48c", "created": 1629906501, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPGj5JDjcRk5P2sxym8W6zRsgNeSYe11T8XoQpEnJPEHf", "voter": "0x6ef71cA9cD708883E129559F5edBFb9d9D5C6148", "created": 1629905256, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmT1sFeavYnp2TxmiTZB5kWg4FkTbWQdAXJEZYGp9CNNZq", "voter": "0x06c4865ab16c9C760622f19a313a2E637E2e66a2", "created": 1629904547, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQaYkCRJpn9TheKvXfVaBUeyasp2ivz6RHAZw9oq49qNS", "voter": "0x7689F17560b5eE53799f0b37C975927E1258fbB5", "created": 1629898449, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX42KfhCzkwLkMT1nrUPrRDcPrwyr8TmaGE68LWJTeHzt", "voter": "0x5753bf40F4ac8526B85CC5d9F71f00D0197f8EE4", "created": 1629881582, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmamEnQ5JbLaxcJ4PqhiijvinB2nxYZNmTEnDVXEhaBo1U", "voter": "0x940214134c5e8d81DBD5E9015908c697dAB5e0DD", "created": 1629864921, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWtR6nz79ig768dXz1NDTAxp4LBND3FN9dbXonL4okckj", "voter": "0x7E743DFc9472aE3b6C060B85F2DedFCccd6001D2", "created": 1629841296, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfGZFLzn3pbr9h6tVxsrsotTTYWsmchG33tSGCQ6CAmhe", "voter": "0x8d07D225a769b7Af3A923481E1FdF49180e6A265", "created": 1629841132, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbLYcFnvy1V95DQPux2dhhGaD3SKR6V5V7zkckxsQLEe1", "voter": "0x70b6ab736BE7672C917a1ab11E67B5Bc9FddeCA9", "created": 1629837172, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "fei.eth"}}]}
