The guy in this video discusses transferrable HEX stakes and how you might go about creating a loan against a HEX stake.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-3TA7X-hvc\nWould it be possible to create an official \"Mantra DAO\" smart contract that can create a transferable HEX stake via an NFT or something that you could then also take a loan against?\nIf this is possible, then there are a few reasons why I think this could be beneficial to the Mantra DAO token holders. Many HEX holders already want a solution to transfer stakes. If the Mantra DAO app page showed stakes that went through the official \"Mantra DAO\" smart contract, it would incentivize people to check their stakes through the Mantra DAO app and anyone receiving a HEX NFT would also go through the Mantra DAO app page bringing more attention to the app in general. As for the loans, I am not quite sure how it would work in terms of the liquidations vs. the lockup period. But given that's figured out, then I would assume its possible to make interest on that loan and maybe even a percent cut off the interest gained on the HEX stake itself as to accrue value for the OM token holders. And of course if the person fails to repay their loan then they lose their HEX stake. \nI know many people do not like HEX, but in my mind a smart contract such as the one described above would be a great mutually beneficial tool for both products and get more people to use the Mantra DAO app in the future.", "choices": ["Mantra DAO Developers should look into this immediately ", "Mantra DAO Developers should look into this at some point", "Mantra DAO Developers should keep this on the back burner for now", "HEX is just a scam and should be avoided "], "start": 1606522800, "end": 1609448340, "snapshot": "11334704", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5554dA63058bdd6DEc5b4Ccb958FeE47bFDF5e9B", "space": {"id": "mantra-dao", "name": "MANTRA DAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
