This should be done with 2 numbers. The first number is \"STAKER TURNOUT\" to be determined by the number of TOTAL staking addresses divided by the number of staking addresses that actually voted. The second number should be \"MONEY TURNOUT\" which is to be determined by the TOTAL dollar amount of OM being staked divided by the dollar amount of Om in the wallets of all of the staked addresses that voted.
