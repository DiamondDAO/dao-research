This allows a user to specify which ranges they would like to supply capital rather then your standard zero to infinity curve. This increases capital efficiency & ROI and turned liquidity mining into a much more profitable venture then in v2. The main problem with this new mechanic is only the most dedicated power users will consistently see these new increased yields. The Solution?\n\nLixir.Finance\nLixir Protocol delivers optimal capital efficiency, minimum impermanent loss and solves the inactive liquidity problem in Uniswap v3 yield farming. Simply choose your desired token pairs, and Lixir optimizes and auto-balances your positions accordingly. Our application will be live next week. we are a utility platform designed to maxamize your returns through LP & incentivize users to participate with $LIX tokens. \n\nWe believe $lix will be the leader in this new category of automators & would like to be included in the Zentrest platform. Lixir investors can use it to go long or double up on positions as well as borrow other assets from Zentrest. This also would increase exposure to MantraDAO & the OM token.\n\nIf you would like to learn more please take a few moments and check out our website and medium articles.\n\nhttps://lixir.finance/\nhttps://lixir-finance.medium.com/\n", "choices": ["Yes, add LIX to Zenterest", "No, do not add LIX to Zenterest"], "start": 1621267200, "end": 1621612800, "snapshot": "12453611", "state": "closed", "author": "0x5b00F3D1644fF3106248B2C50505A67ABF31efFF", "space": {"id": "mantra-dao", "name": "MANTRA DAO"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmT8quLekm3CKWjZRfuzQdbPNbsiN5j9LgDKdMSMfDz1yq", "voter": "0x311F21570ABb9bB7d825c0990975079EF22e9d63", "created": 1621528940, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mantra-dao"}}, {"id": "QmWLfQVsgnhijXNT61zyBcehYSUiwnQUubUSQJAoZY8zQm", "voter": "0xf7200f7a475b53446A10421DEa95299fA9319A85", "created": 1621461887, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mantra-dao"}}, {"id": "QmePMHjNTRctguMgS3ep7GLtpyabvYg4MB53JeYi56Cxsb", "voter": "0x91d7Ff5660435a218BfB2DBEe4C1Ec865892b2E2", "created": 1621330962, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mantra-dao"}}]}
