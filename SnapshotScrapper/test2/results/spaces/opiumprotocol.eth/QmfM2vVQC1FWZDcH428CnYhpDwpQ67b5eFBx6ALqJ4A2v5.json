The reason for that is to prevent LPs to have extra expenses interacting with the contract.\n\nThe Dr.Opium period was supposed to be almost finished by now, if the rewards had been placed on a Dr.Opium contract at the end of May, the charity period would be almost gone by now.\n\nThe compensation for May was supposed to be 200k $OPIUM.", "choices": ["Pay 200k $Opium via airdrop", "Pay 200k $Opium via Dr.Opium", "Pay 100k $Opium via airdrop", "Pay 100k $Opium via Dr.Opium"], "start": 1629252000, "end": 1629856800, "snapshot": "13047116", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6381CFb0f98CA6481A45FF52ff20Aaf799f31377", "space": {"id": "opiumprotocol.eth", "name": "Opium Network"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmevyiktna3k7DxTbK16aAGrN5HNvmYX6opjpB9e3cd2D2", "voter": "0xBD1f7d88C76A86C60d41bDDD4819fAe404e7151E", "created": 1629686625, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "opiumprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNMCyphk6Z3s6NKKtKxHWWPfHyqaUhWpuxseLtZbHcSkG", "voter": "0x5bAeb401590b14b7aF4294DeadD0eb4177763D91", "created": 1629311762, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "opiumprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbYH7tWBhL8vrU6h1KJtPbwpAASwKF1q5U61zM6yY1VYU", "voter": "0x6381CFb0f98CA6481A45FF52ff20Aaf799f31377", "created": 1629262832, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "opiumprotocol.eth"}}]}
