I don't think DROPIUM should be forced across all pools, having the variety may attract more liquidity to the network and hence further the protocols development.", "choices": ["Distribute rewards normally", "Distribute rewards using DROPIUM"], "start": 1617580800, "end": 1617667200, "snapshot": "12179394", "state": "closed", "author": "0xeD5e679d74273Ca5C319DAc2229f2e87E20903Ea", "space": {"id": "opiumprotocol.eth", "name": "Opium Network"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmTYfVboCvtvQwKkHV6M9PHJoQKdoqoWspTM9RsRkFTAjn", "voter": "0x598f2152764aa4Ca9CA92663C4A9Fde3FDe2Ec58", "created": 1617626947, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "opiumprotocol.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaWCJf7zm48umdThHUkHA2N9Nbbxvw4d7QWGTv2PKF3iP", "voter": "0xeD5e679d74273Ca5C319DAc2229f2e87E20903Ea", "created": 1617622064, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "opiumprotocol.eth"}}]}
