Accordingly, the BuckSwap community is always proposing new use cases for the growth of the BuckSwap community. In order to build together, BuckSwap\u2019s users can utilize $BUCKS to offer proposals and also vote on those proposals. \n\n## Proposals\nAll $BUCKS holders (100 $BUCKS minimum) can offer proposals on further developments and changes to the BuckSwap protocol.\n\n## Voting\nAll $BUCKS holders can vote on proposals. Each $BUCKS staked in the Staking Contract will generate an equal number of votes in the BuckSwap governance contract. \n\n## Execution\nFor a proposal to be executed, it must obtain 40% of all possible votes. More than 50% of the 40% of all possible votes must be \u201cYES\u201d. \n\n***\n\nNOTE: Currently we are only using the Balance of $BUCKS in wallet for votes. This proposal includes the \"Voting\" section of our Governance proposal to also allow stakers to vote with their staked $BUCKS.", "choices": ["I AGREE", "SUGGEST CHANGES TO OUR TEAM"], "start": 1620007200, "end": 1621562400, "snapshot": "7092622", "state": "closed", "author": "0xca4E7Fa9f618684779E11E7DE7c32da7651de4ce", "space": {"id": "buckswap.eth", "name": "Buckswap.io"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmaKEeueaP8qntZ1muB61kx6Pixit3tp6J31sz4dAJU5xc", "voter": "0x456Bbb42ca7902502b71aD2106E43396Af2eE931", "created": 1621068512, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "buckswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeeNcQJwtUHnybCezgXDQggWsTfRsvhoujRRmxKq33iZb", "voter": "0xa8C0e104f7219b5B466F2F06378D4698CCa2AcB0", "created": 1621060201, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "buckswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXxv7BbHtzyA8uMfHT3w3ZmupQwc92KnwakvNJa2GmKfX", "voter": "0x3c15b9d0179a2e8dC6eE69eFFcc43A9eF0d2b264", "created": 1620996810, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "buckswap.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfXvsozwmNSNzadagRouNfqtiA9vvF5KS2hvTW7so1Xo8", "voter": "0xAD0A63D64DA1001fFA6D7e46D4aF7474D8E81e56", "created": 1620981554, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "buckswap.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmae7MQV5WZfvrQmmcVZXqHtz2GQtXR9v5iBhL7wNyTH8o", "voter": "0x9A0E30951A916EF100B11B2e93ef0B7552d61aDB", "created": 1620981023, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "buckswap.eth"}}]}
