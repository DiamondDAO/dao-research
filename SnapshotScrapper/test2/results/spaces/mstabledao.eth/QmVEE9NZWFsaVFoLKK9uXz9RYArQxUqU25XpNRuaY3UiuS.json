We have committed to being one of the initial cohort of projects to use Snapsafe, as was publicly communicated via the Gnosis twitter and blog. \n\nA contribution to the bug bounty is not only a gesture of goodwill and a commitment to the collaborative and open ethos of DeFi as an ecosystem, it is also a contribution to the future integrity of a tool we will rely on. With this in mind, it is motioned to contribute some amount of MTA to the Gnosis Snapsafe bug bounty pool.\n\nOther project contributions can be taken as benchmarks:\n\n- Yearn: 10k USD\n- Balancer: 200 BAL (c10k USD)\n- \"Others\" @ 1-5k USD\n\nSome of these contributions have already been sent, and can be viewed on chain [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0a147ddf0817ade664eb9cb343d96a21ed857d11#tokentxns).\n\n**Should the mStableDAO contribute to the Gnosis Snapsafe bug bounty pool?**", "choices": ["No, we should not contribute", "Yes, 1,000 USD in MTA", "Yes, 2,000 USD in MTA", "Yes, 5,000 USD in MTA", "Yes, 7,500 USD in MTA", "Yes, 10,000 USD in MTA", "Yes, 20,000 USD in MTA", "Yes, but some other amount", "Abstain"], "start": 1616626800, "end": 1616886000, "snapshot": "12098432", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4B37BbC8CAb32aade27Ce8b1bb2A9E614de81E03", "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth", "name": "mStable DAO"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXS6hfREXjJ1BvGn22S85xuA37t2CufdYSZEU7xmiWEvQ", "voter": "0x9afF049B4F2E0269F5ae07F3FBf0414ef600Fb0e", "created": 1616726149, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdTZdq8xKzkia8MFGG6WTmEhCJj9DkSapsqrbTfY14aaf", "voter": "0x8092923e19c86965733BD6F3fE6C13F549C3Bf44", "created": 1616721066, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPCkjYQjXc6xXxJXcyCKssCofkx9z5wTRGyCtruKcBMNR", "voter": "0x021c1a1cE318E7B4545f6280b248062592B71706", "created": 1616710077, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQrf9piKMMm6z58jLythPjVeKiteUzxdB9Bha7iPkmYio", "voter": "0xd576E7A3D3791C3BcF907eeDe72B2a500a8f54D5", "created": 1616678015, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTHELXsrcxZ1SceFec8Dxts7dGGAsazMtXSjkej4oGPSo", "voter": "0x4B37BbC8CAb32aade27Ce8b1bb2A9E614de81E03", "created": 1616654078, "choice": 4, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}]}
