{"id": "QmaJHC9ynzfvqxhQ4KPcus7hMoWxYfoJQ4zqNEVmQ6NRMX", "title": "dHEDGE DHT Rewards Claim & Stake - Revised", "body": "The DTOP tokens the mStableDAO treasury currently holds earn DHT rewards, which is the native governance token of dHEDGE. It is proposed that whilst we hold DTOP that we claim and stake the accumulated DHT on a quarterly basis, starting from the end of this month. Claiming and staking further boosts our yields, so it is in our best interest to do so.\n\nThis proposal seeks approval to continuously claim accumulated DHT from the [performance mining](https://app.dhedge.org/rewards/performance-mining) and [staking contract](https://app.dhedge.org/rewards/staking) and consequently compound these rewards in the DHT staking contract on a quarterly basis starting from the end of June 2021 until the process significantly changes on the side of dHEDGE, or the mStableDAO proposes a change in this workflow. \n\nSince the operation is rather simple in nature, and no other risk to the position is given other than basic smart contract risk, no further proposals will be necessary to continue this operation, and the Cat Herder will keep track of timely execution of this workflow moving forward as to not miss any claim operation in the following months.\n\nAlternatively, it was also proposed that we should liquidate accumulated DHT from the contract on a quarterly basis and exchange them for ETH in order to begin building out our ETH position for future Liquidity Mining and being able to directly reimburse gas from the treasury, amongst other future opportunities.\n\n**How should the accumulated DHT rewards from our dHEDGE position be spent moving forward?**", "choices": ["Claim & stake 100% of rewards", "Liquidate all rewards to ETH", "25% claim & stake/75% liquidate", "50% claim & stake/50% liquidate", "75% claim & stake/25% liquidate", "Abstain"], "start": 1624507200, "end": 1625025600, "snapshot": "12694877", "state": "closed", "author": "0x908DB31Ce01DC42c8B712f9156E969bc65023119", "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth", "name": "mStable DAO"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmNaq1v7ck5RsuSxiqMMGotaR6JPj3FVEK9m9VTrBwSBwV", "voter": "0x9afF049B4F2E0269F5ae07F3FBf0414ef600Fb0e", "created": 1624615565, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPVoHd6LskAvshERs7b3k31jkw5j3r1wJT9yfVJe4Xw58", "voter": "0x021c1a1cE318E7B4545f6280b248062592B71706", "created": 1624614735, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdiDLYJebqPikBXDWQvqLkHdMXU1qwrQFd4G9Z8BEThUM", "voter": "0xd576E7A3D3791C3BcF907eeDe72B2a500a8f54D5", "created": 1624527134, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUgBBA1v7acszRMPQUsBdWgEyJQtrrmyJdX8yd8MLSVpN", "voter": "0x4B37BbC8CAb32aade27Ce8b1bb2A9E614de81E03", "created": 1624513960, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}]}
