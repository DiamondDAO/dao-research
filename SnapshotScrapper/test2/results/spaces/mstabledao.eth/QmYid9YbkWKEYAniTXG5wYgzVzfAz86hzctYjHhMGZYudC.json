This motion specifically refers to liquidity in DAI/MTA that was contributed by the DAO after being ratified [here](https://snapshot.org/#/mstable/proposal/QmNeVEhg8rd2pNqgpVkd4xQfKsQSVffyB7KV3QjAJEwyiK) by Meta Governors. \n\nDue to [this](https://snapshot.org/#/mstabledao.eth/proposal/QmdY4c6LJ4mLgrd1XpQqJrgk2Pxru3GNATrQHZj9YfyM6d) and [this](https://snapshot.org/#/mstabledao.eth/proposal/Qmbd5v1FgQn4vqPrmmVZ4KAwfPSSx9Xu3H6sS83b916hUh) vote having failed to reach quorum and provide a conclusive outcome for either range, another brainstorming session was held on the 10th of June by the mStableDAO in order to decide on more concrete numbers, and the group came to the decision that a conservative range between **$0.25 and $4** work out best, considering the current price of roughly $1 per MTA token and a resulting 75% buffer in price change upwards and downwards.\n\nIt was also decided that once the MTA token price reaches a threshold **below $0.50 and above $3** that the position be re-evaluated and a new updated range set for the position to avoid single-sided liquidation of the entire position, and this follow-up proposal is meant to ratify the conclusions made to migrate the position in this way.\n\n**Should we migrate the DAI/MTA Uniswap v2 position in the above-mentioned range between $0.25 and $4?**", "choices": ["Yes, migrate with this range", "No, migrate with different range", "Abstain"], "start": 1623405600, "end": 1623837600, "snapshot": "12613003", "state": "closed", "author": "0x908DB31Ce01DC42c8B712f9156E969bc65023119", "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth", "name": "mStable DAO"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRnFri4odUARvmaj8WzGVWEyWvyCSrh6HdUzf5KU57sRk", "voter": "0x9afF049B4F2E0269F5ae07F3FBf0414ef600Fb0e", "created": 1623748994, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU6a8jq35ShCt2U1CQ1EKLVjmbZuSXRyCNgFv6zFtKdkr", "voter": "0xd576E7A3D3791C3BcF907eeDe72B2a500a8f54D5", "created": 1623671938, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaynuqQMeUEvEhsEytbj4eMohns8d3o7m9AvCyLrWjMr4", "voter": "0x021c1a1cE318E7B4545f6280b248062592B71706", "created": 1623657383, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQwteSdjqqZvsBawnzk4tbghUdX3a3aE8kvkcrFP8RdeH", "voter": "0x4B37BbC8CAb32aade27Ce8b1bb2A9E614de81E03", "created": 1623553132, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSLADAKDFM4zuYq78r8tdt8wp8X68UzW8WvVjt6bqn45F", "voter": "0xba0E104fF9a400089cc4882f976094fde14AC5E3", "created": 1623505089, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}]}
