This is done alongside the motioned removal of MTA/WETH rewards for the Uniswap EARN pool (MDP20.2). \n\nIt would use the entire balance of DAI, with an MTA amount to match that will be driven by the weight and MTA's price at the time.\n\nThis motion will expose the tokens to impermanent loss, which is a factor that must be considered by signers in approving or rejecting this motion.\n\nAs this motion impacts both the DAO's USD treasury and MTA, it will be presented to Meta governors for a vote along with a forum post that covers both MDP20.1 and MDP20.2, assuming both are ratified by signers.\n\n**Should MDP20.1 be created and shared as a public proposal on the mStable forum and snapshot page?**", "choices": ["Yes", "No", "Abstain"], "start": 1616626800, "end": 1616886000, "snapshot": "12092413", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4B37BbC8CAb32aade27Ce8b1bb2A9E614de81E03", "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth", "name": "mStable DAO"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmccAGmcvRBKZg7YpZBmXuuU2A6fUa6gjUJVd3bhYJSeb7", "voter": "0x8092923e19c86965733BD6F3fE6C13F549C3Bf44", "created": 1616720964, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZ1K6bGVnCnCoYQbND9vnajH7p2AD1PruDq18Bnq6fzQY", "voter": "0x021c1a1cE318E7B4545f6280b248062592B71706", "created": 1616709825, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPEyQqd9KgRBpTJyB6TuKUhodhh3H9YAZ2oKMVnw2GfV7", "voter": "0xd576E7A3D3791C3BcF907eeDe72B2a500a8f54D5", "created": 1616677558, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXKfGUAPmhZnHnJnJWU3dSa4PtFkJW451UPZevNoZvT3m", "voter": "0x4B37BbC8CAb32aade27Ce8b1bb2A9E614de81E03", "created": 1616650437, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}]}
