Barnem is requesting that these funds come from the Funding subDAO as these funds have already been approved by Meta Governors. \n\nPlease note the urgency of this request given Coinbase's deadline of this coming Wednesday or latest Thursday. \n\n**Should the TreasuryDAO Funding subDAO disburse 1,000,000 mUSD as a zero-interest loan to Barnem for 3 months as requested above?**", "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"], "start": 1637146800, "end": 1637319600, "snapshot": "13633224", "state": "closed", "author": "0x908DB31Ce01DC42c8B712f9156E969bc65023119", "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth", "name": "mStable DAO"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x4d67d589c10867f8ec05d9c1db1bebd0397f7de49005d90bb23b1779c7b816b9", "voter": "0x524269E900ca6ebe2FC57d719995c8D167F8b260", "created": 1637176007, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xb7c280fd56741f8badc1dff3c289e4929151697ae92f45bd3895ec2d301c2ead", "voter": "0xd576E7A3D3791C3BcF907eeDe72B2a500a8f54D5", "created": 1637162577, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xfd6143a0c113c12967c1b93d22c40492049115cb20e21fb24210860c86e4a9b3", "voter": "0x4B37BbC8CAb32aade27Ce8b1bb2A9E614de81E03", "created": 1637162439, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe90465754007506e15b8be910ca2a468b50939f33584fa71082f56b45b9b5f39", "voter": "0x9afF049B4F2E0269F5ae07F3FBf0414ef600Fb0e", "created": 1637156562, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}]}
