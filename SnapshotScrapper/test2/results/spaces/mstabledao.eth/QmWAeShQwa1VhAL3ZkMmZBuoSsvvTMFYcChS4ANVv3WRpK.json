This will keep the MTA tokens custodied by the mStableDAO, whilst also providing trading fees that will be a source of income into perpetuity. \n\nOver time, this 5k weekly emission will accrue to a large pool of capital, addressing MTA/ETH liquidity and generating returns from fees. Once a sufficient amount of liquidity has been established, the reward can then be repurposed to \"higher\" goals for the mStable protocol.\n\n**Should this motion be brought forward and shared as a public proposal on the mStable forum and snapshot page?**", "choices": ["Yes", "No", "Abstain"], "start": 1627444800, "end": 1627898400, "snapshot": "12912143", "state": "closed", "author": "0x908DB31Ce01DC42c8B712f9156E969bc65023119", "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth", "name": "mStable DAO"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qmd9zXSpkPVAbimMiEzq9BWesWcQoFCQPtj4Grjvhv9NFu", "voter": "0xba0E104fF9a400089cc4882f976094fde14AC5E3", "created": 1627688729, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQZffUzDMGuFqPVxaL6TvPRKozkLaH6EVkZg5FAFTkGZp", "voter": "0x9afF049B4F2E0269F5ae07F3FBf0414ef600Fb0e", "created": 1627533210, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmY222u9nmZWPanLQtAF2oDTP2eJzUgujVY5q4LLTiPvZw", "voter": "0xd576E7A3D3791C3BcF907eeDe72B2a500a8f54D5", "created": 1627528453, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSjipute5oLC74b54d6PhdGf4EJCuUfgNm7EwEaL9whAY", "voter": "0x4B37BbC8CAb32aade27Ce8b1bb2A9E614de81E03", "created": 1627445001, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "mstabledao.eth"}}]}
