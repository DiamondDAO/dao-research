Members of the Tetu community were able to identify the problem of low liquidity and its consequences. \nThey were also accurate in suggesting effective solutions. A solid suggestion proposed by the community is protocol-owned liquidity. \nIt is possible to build and start managing the protocol with its own liquidity, creating liquidity over time using resources from the protocol itself. \nThe protocol-owned liquidity would be in the FundKeeper contract. \nOwn liquidity will be beneficial to the protocol, however, it is necessary to decide through this governance proposal how this protocol-owned liquidity will be built. \n\nCurrently, Tetu's profit split on 90/10:\n90% Buyback TETU for xTETU holders\n10% to FundKeeper for the second stage\n\nThe proposal is split 90% in two directions\nX% for TETU buyback for Profit Share\nY% will be used to create Protocol owned liquidity\n\nCreating liquidity requires TETU and USDC. Thus, we can use half of Y% amount for buyback TETU and a half keep in USDC. \nThis option will keep buybacks on similar levels, precisely a 25% TETU buyback reduction as 25% of total buyback would be used to pair TETU with USDC. \n\nOr use a part of TETU emission for this purpose. It will increase TETU on the free market and reduce buying pressure but we will generate liquidity more aggressively.\n\nX/Y ratio will be an adjustable option and able to change from DAO in the future.\nWe offer to start with 50/50 ratio.\n\n1) Use Y% for liquidity without TETU emissions.\n\n2) Use part of TETU emissions for liquidity generation.\n\n3) Do nothing. Keep 100% Buy Back for xTETU holders.
