These examples are illustrative and should not be considered a binding part of the text of the constitution itself.\n\nI. Name ownership shall not be infringed\n HalloweenBears governance will not enact any change that infringes on the rights of  HalloweenBears users to retain names they own, or unfairly discriminate against name owners\u2019 ability to extend, transfer, or otherwise use their names.\n\nExamples\nPermissible:  HalloweenBears governance may enact a change affecting the registration or ext HalloweenBearsion costs of all names based on transparent criteria such as length, as long as it pursues a goal outlined in this constitution.\n\nNot Permissible:  HalloweenBears governance must not enact a change increasing or reducing the ext HalloweenBearsion costs of a list of existing  HalloweenBears names, as this would unfairly benefit or penalise a handpicked group.\n\nII. Fees are primarily an incentive mechanism\nThe primary purpose of registration fees is as an incentive mechanism to prevent the namespace becoming overwhelmed with speculatively registered names. A secondary purpose is to provide enough revenue to the DAO to fund ongoing development and improvement of  HalloweenBears.  HalloweenBears governance will not enact any fee other than for these purposes.\n\nExamples\nPermissible:  HalloweenBears governance may increase the price of name registrations in order to address excessive speculative registrations induced by a price that is set too low, or because the current price is insufficient to fund ongoing  HalloweenBears operations at a reasonable level.\n\nNot Permissible:  HalloweenBears governance must not enact a change imposing a fee for claiming DNS domains inside  HalloweenBears, because such a fee would be purely an income generating measure and not an incentive mechanism.\n\nIII. Income funds  HalloweenBears and other public goods\nAny income generated to the  HalloweenBears treasury is to be used first of all to  HalloweenBearsure the long-term viability of  HalloweenBears, and to fund continuing development and improvement of the  HalloweenBears system. Funds that are not reasonably required to achieve this goal may be used to fund other public goods within web3 as  HalloweenBears governance sees fit.\n\n HalloweenBears governance will not allocate funds to a team or individual who does not commit to uphold the same principles outlined in this constitution in their use of the allocated funds.\n\nExamples\nPermissible:  HalloweenBears governance may offer grant funding for a public good unrelated to  HalloweenBears or Ethereum, so long as doing so does not affect the long-term viability of  HalloweenBears.\n\nNot Permissible:  HalloweenBears governance must not use the funds to support projects that conflict with the goals of  HalloweenBears.\n\nIV.  HalloweenBears Integrates with the global namespace\nIn order to facilitate making the most widely usable naming system,  HalloweenBears aims to integrate with the legacy DNS naming system to the greatest extent possible without sacrificing decentralization of  HalloweenBears.  HalloweenBears governance will not enact changes that compromise  HalloweenBears\u2019s ability to do this.\n\nExamples\nPermissible:  HalloweenBears governance should grant control of a top-level domain to its owner in the DNS system on request.\n\nNot permissible:  HalloweenBears governance must not create new top-level domains unless those domains have been granted to  HalloweenBears by a DNS authority.\n\nV. Amendments to this constitution by majority vote\nAny change may be made to this constitution only by two-thirds majority and at least 1% of all tok HalloweenBears participating.of the remaining articles, and any new articles, becomes the responsibility of  HalloweenBears DAO delegates. In such a situation, the modified Constitution may be ratified by an article-by-article approval vote by delegates with a period of at least one week.\n", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1637380800, "end": 1637467200, "snapshot": "13649498", "state": "closed", "author": "0xaF65607288Ed9836CAA59955D537cb96681Ca0DE", "space": {"id": "halloweenbearsdao.eth", "name": "HalloweenBearsDAO"}, "votes": 10, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x2dff80c0ca7e55f44c6b725905454d092548b31461c13bcd8b45fed205b88d93", "voter": "0xd4Af804b5fc981c889E7b7c3af0E8D8aC2e2630D", "created": 1637450722, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "halloweenbearsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x41900e5c899dec333b2d15c34ed0e198720d799b3eed937fce309fca9e0d99c7", "voter": "0x5D748F90D62f99f6C2E4b95664e287CACfb06052", "created": 1637441733, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "halloweenbearsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc2f1f9236863b01e6585579419d2f44a38bf25e043957d3f69c99aa9add83092", "voter": "0x9AB7ADae1579eA2843742e6618433995b0F51044", "created": 1637440325, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "halloweenbearsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc302c9bd937f137390e1281af64fd011a56539ef39998092db611029d7345fc4", "voter": "0x66A9fd6f50FBC50774d7C635f9631b3aDc554869", "created": 1637433397, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "halloweenbearsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x591b4e22477dc1ec5430fc69afcf186e3411050a191febb5108e27631fa1e5a0", "voter": "0xD79e95247604bC60992A1872990d50B436028a7B", "created": 1637433340, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "halloweenbearsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x37bd6e9a19a60f95fa5753ef3b170733f831594565f20f99ccf64284eb0fd017", "voter": "0xEa8e2a86890D7f0b8316A77D5EFd6fC2a6D56218", "created": 1637413031, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "halloweenbearsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xf003396fece37a0463b5ce03e0713d76a223c4035d20a9af3ea68ef937331ae2", "voter": "0x8D31EBec6c6DA81B5841810D338bFcB291c0c9D8", "created": 1637410468, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "halloweenbearsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xbd3a0ae00693d999ae671f80982300a485b7cad020aebb15c53b1d0ff16bf92c", "voter": "0x1D915159Aeee1c9d71B4bE758301938B26be0966", "created": 1637401221, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "halloweenbearsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x8bed79cda754a99739c76f4ff06aa2dbe074f68208f439e32318954b9a5a06e8", "voter": "0x08A5ae15FAE7A78517438A7e44f3DefE588dEf6f", "created": 1637401191, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "halloweenbearsdao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x3a944d07690cbfe346c31f1889f866d225e715ba20f99b3ca2c2f56ba4c67926", "voter": "0x3EBD637f0Fc8F1BAC02CBd138916A8E2d7F5898A", "created": 1637400859, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "halloweenbearsdao.eth"}}]}
