One of the most efficient training tools I use is \"simplifying\" things and creating spaces where people can come to learn more and grow together... but at their own pace. My goal is to cultivate that \"Safe Space\" here in the Global Designer Network as well, especially for our newbies<3 \n\n*Call to action:\n- A monthly Voice chat where old and new designers can come to have an AMA style discussion (it can be about projects, advice, anything)--- because I am still very new too the space myself, as we all are in some aspect, I think it would be great for me to organize but as many designers as possible to participate in the conversation to help encourage connecting with the new people that are joining the network as well.\n\n*Purpose:\n- During this monthly voice chat we will review upcoming projects and updates that have been dropped in the chat. It will be beneficial to be able to direct people to \"The Safe Space\" to ask questions or meet and chat with other designers about what is happening in further details in a low stress environment.\n- This call should be very fluid where everyone feels welcome to speak/share freely. That will also be great for building more connections and rapport within our community. \n\n*I know we already have a few weekly chats and I do not want to be repetitive nor take away from another area but I did want to give snapshot voting a try and also see what you guys think about this additional meet up! \n\n*If pushed through I would advise to have one week to vote then the following week be our first meet up on nov 1st time TBA (that way the conversation can always fall on the first of the month and be easy to remember monthly)\n\nPeace & Blessings\nMo'Casso", "choices": ["Yes lets do it !
