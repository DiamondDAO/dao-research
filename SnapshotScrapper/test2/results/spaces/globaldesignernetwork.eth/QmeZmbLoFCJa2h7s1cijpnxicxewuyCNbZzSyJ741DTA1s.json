It is a positive sum way for us to both support our fellow members, as well as grow the tangible value of assets that we hold in the web3 fashion market. \n\nThe vote will include a list of designers from the GDN with live NFTs for sale, with a 5 day voting period for every $GDN member here on snapshot. The designer with the highest votes at the end of that 5 day period has their work purchased. I would also suggest that we maintain a broad base, whereby we don't repeat purchase designers too often, and instead have a 12 month interim (at least whilst we are continuing with a bi-monthly purchasing pattern) between purchasing a piece from the same designer. \n\nFor the initial purchases, I would be happy to allocate $MONA that I have received from my own NFT sales to jumpstart this initiative. As the treasury accrues more value we can then start to set a budget for these purchases. \n\nIt is part of our responsibility, as leaders in web3 fashion, to make the local market as a whole more appealing for each other to succeed and attract the masses of buyers that we desire.\n\nOption One:\nYes\n\nOption Two:\nNo\n\nOption Three:\nYes, but with different proposal terms i.e not bimonthly but instead something else.
