{"id": "QmNffFvZ2tEBRQngWBjjMcYeNFKyiyiNXesDMfmKw4kf1X", "title": "Web3 Fashion Guild: The DLTA System ", "body": "Background:\nWith the upcoming launch of $W3F, the GDN's liquid ERC-20, there are four distinct pools that classify distribution. And, one of those distribution channels is through \"Speciality NFTs\" that the GDN sells/airdrops with certain products and releases. Holders of the Speciality NFTs can stake them to earn $W3F. \n\nThis mechanism is great for supporting further Fashion x DeFi utility, and also for incentivising NFT sales for the GDN, just like how the DIGITALAX NFTs are in combination incentivised through $MONA staking functionality. \n\nI am creating this proposal to put forward a more active and self sustaining way that $W3F can be distributed through the Speciality NFT pool, and, also, begin to develop a robust mechanism to assess NFT value through token gated community consensus, and, repeated sentiment discovery. This is critical for further maturing the web3 fashion market, where currently most of the broader NFT buying, selling and collecting behaviour is driven by black box guess work. \n\nIn September, DIGITALAX released The DLTA System\u2014 an NFT appraisal and guild development system, whereby the PODE NFT holders were the first guild to onboard. You can view the activity here: https://thedlta.xyz/ and read the whitepaper here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p-fkR-NPJL2pV9W-TjStCAcPZjif24Rf/view\n\nThe roadmap for DLTA has always been to continue to onboard new guilds and gather further appraisal data for underwriting more of the cross reference-able metastory based value of NFTs. \n\nOnboarding a Web3 Fashion guild to the DLTA System, whereby the 21% allocation for speciality NFTs is distributed through The DLTA/whitelisted NFT appraisals and to speciality NFT holders, incentivises recognition of those that are most active in the ecosystem, spreads the full extent and reach to which $W3F can be held by the masses, and also introduces less casual and more engaged community/ecosystem members. \n\nFor this, I would propose that half of the 21% distribution to the speciality NFT pool is re-allocated for distribution in The DLTA system through the Web3 Fashion guild, for a period of 6 months. After this time, a vote can take place for either continuing guild distribution in DLTA, or instead, re-allocating the tokens to be purely yielded through passive NFT staking.   \n\nIn the Web3 Fashion Guild, membership NFTs would be sold to the market with different utility, with the sale providing greater liquidity for the GDN Treasury, purveyors and broader web3 fashion market build out. Whitelisted NFTs put into the system for appraisal can be decided by the DAO overtime. \n\nIf this proposal passes, I also suggest the the GDN DAO communicates with the PODE holders, as they are the first guild in the system and also have $DLTA allocation (upon its release), for voting within the DLTA.
