However, as it sits today, there is no fluent way or well defined standard for different virtual worlds to be able to have an interoperability component within their land across the realms. \n\nEstablishing a standard for interoperable districts is of critical importance, because, if we are confined to silos within the metaverse then it goes against some of the core principles of what the metaverse actually is; a truly persistent, immersive and open space measured across time. \n\nUnder the last PODE announcement (Can be viewed here: https://www.digitalax.xyz/pode-vlo) extensive details were shared in regards to implementation of the Player Creator Portal as a native web3 steam alternative. The concept of Virtual Land Offerings (VLOs) for indie developers and modders within the platform as they integrate web3 value layer mechanics through NFT wrapped content and assets was described as well. \n\nOne of the most prominent pathways for these VLOs to promulgate beyond the initial seed game environments where their utility and value is first surfaced is done through a clear and established standard for the interoperability of these NFTs across different virtual worlds. This standard will first have strong usage within the IMG (Indie Modder\u2019s Guild) Constellation and also can be adopted with a soft enforcement mechanism by any web3 orientated virtual land protocol, present or future. \n\nWith that said, there is a live governance proposal on the DIGITALAX governance forum here to start initiating the deliberation around both the establishment of the web3 realms interoperability standard, as well as the role of PODE V2 holders within the platform in relation to governance and influence over the interoperability standard itself, the mechanics behind a indie game or mod gaining VLO status and select functions within the IMG as IMG members expand into PODE V2 holders. \n\nExtending on from that, and the closely aligned relationship that the GDN will start forming with the IMG, especially under The Constellation initiative here: https://blog.digitalax.xyz/open-source-web3-indie-modding-and-gaming-constellation-f39588692a83. \n\nThis proposal is for beginning the discussion on whether the GDN should undertake forming the Web3 Fashion Metaverse Interoperability standard (W3FM.IS)\u2014 as we receive fashion blueprints from the IMG for integrating directly with their game environments and virtual worlds we can start forming metadata around this and constructing more robust conduits between each retopology process as the same outfit is ported cross platform. This also feeds directly into content that we will add and open source to the Web3 Fashion Meta Source Vault. \n\nIt is a basic yes / no vote for us initiating the project, but we can discuss more in depth the details of the mechanics in the FIP-008 discord channel. \n\nAs the deliberation progresses more suggestions and comments will be added to this thread.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1635876000, "end": 1636135200, "snapshot": "20906070", "state": "closed", "author": "0xfa3fea500eeDAa120f7EeC2E4309Fe094F854E61", "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth", "name": "GDN DAO"}, "votes": 17, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x9ce5fcd2bd1aa4627bb08bbfbec494039723a41c7ad93961f2d075a548138f88", "voter": "0x3770a61A197867A8458C56a1B43745f05d591b17", "created": 1636102944, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0x46a44cab886d3582cba002f63917469396e504f6d6d4fd8df3923b8d1835efd8", "voter": "0xF9EFe16A7F953e2aEE6Ea57B53c319aD33C233FD", "created": 1636071370, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVVkcu3K4QLWMWc79wPtpFA2fxrKanNgQ3B4zvGMEzWjJ", "voter": "0xB8eE29bb3c72c50A1fD189d526B5394B85cAC34d", "created": 1636065465, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0x728a6f248c610598c9d3b6579202afd27038b292f8a4de07ad702d4069a7ae6d", "voter": "0x07d13646BC89BfF92631A38B839F803b152f606d", "created": 1636058126, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0x46b63853895de4c187fa80c9107a6afcefe18610b0aa94d0cc3fbf10282dcbda", "voter": "0x10539743603fce93a0F8965E2BB7F45bF91Ad413", "created": 1636055895, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0xdf4b070b7f142e7e52cac03af577ce02c10caf65bea2ec8a139e706871197f01", "voter": "0x780909C4F1305E5953041E744B09E2F016180676", "created": 1636044396, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0x33a4e361059add2daddbe3dce27c02e475a162bd5dd8933b6f8c9b391830fe0c", "voter": "0x89c96a9d9b43238db1f35D2297483d6964a56DFE", "created": 1636030529, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0x3657bfb2a2ddb8f2379f23e92997f1cd4ea4deeb53dfd1c5e16450871b51b9ef", "voter": "0xA415Cfa9E37a864D620BF5304F2966Bcd1BE106c", "created": 1636025106, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0x40e8277a10c8f485ce5bc07b2741afd6ae42b4712da6e1e9d36ee3d5c755c0cc", "voter": "0xD720705F1e8eaE1c7fc9e80a3224326C9eD39925", "created": 1635977965, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0x7d9e463d987d5fb070df44f745715f8f72333dac9db019740ebe108585b4ac83", "voter": "0x2895e99CB6F95209212CeB36A300BDEC1F90777a", "created": 1635925303, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0xccf99ce80129619a2edbbc9a8ff3ef2a2a9a8f7e151e03c813eaabb751f318e0", "voter": "0xB4ff2f835262e3C693E8Ba99907218fC5c01e94B", "created": 1635890745, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0x98e419f43aadb75140a54ffd231d4d8b086966d6771c5be12803d9b5d5b88be5", "voter": "0xff12227e9b1C1713038C69478f87720E4eb45656", "created": 1635890559, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe2b08ca594b132abf25bc8641834a3b3f77a9c8dfc2e8fbffe162c6a8303e067", "voter": "0x3f454680F58D316300f58F5a41ea64c4061a38d5", "created": 1635884814, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0x5ed6b15b773c66f22b7e408e4d1fc6fef9f6a143f68d238ccbdda9757d7564c4", "voter": "0x6A98ca44a35aDBdc0d4cD91E06453cB67a2DD63A", "created": 1635884309, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe24037cdfef888ee4fbb5a4995a24e170988d9141517f05937b1d39c2bb8289e", "voter": "0x32e7319Bf8142276159ACc7D5DddF3AF4474A9DE", "created": 1635883173, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0x907570ffeaf3b2e5c827c88d0348864aea74a8e61a011f054d8e5cb6108a1a8a", "voter": "0x19A23d463b4BE0945C05Ba4e5Aa869adCAa55b08", "created": 1635879606, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "0xc26287e59a2fa87699b5a15dff9225f6df6206702b2169d6d471a86d8ae7f1e4", "voter": "0x2Bf034ecCEbc8CD60Dab9c249b6c2996Dcb7D8EC", "created": 1635878862, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "globaldesignernetwork.eth"}}]}
