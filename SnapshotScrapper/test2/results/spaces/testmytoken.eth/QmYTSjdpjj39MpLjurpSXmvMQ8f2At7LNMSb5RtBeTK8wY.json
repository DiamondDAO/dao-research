UNFI is the token which powers the Global Governance Model (GGM), incorporating Proof of Stake elements to enable the election of the Unifi Council of Representatives. The GGM ensures a richly rewarding experience for the entire Unifi community across all blockchains and especially those who participate in Protocol governance.\n\nAs outlined in this article, the GGM will launch in phases to ensure a smooth and secure transition to community governance. \n\nCommunity Referendums: The Next Step on the Path towards GGM\n\nUnifi is excited to launch the next phase in the GGM rollout plan - Community Referendums! \n\n\n\nCommunity referendums provide a community voice in the GGM to all UNFI holders and can be used for any topic. This is how all users of Unifi can participate in governance actions. \n\nThe Unifi community can use these referendums to poll all UNFI holders on matters involving the Unifi Protocol across all supported blockchains. These informal referendums can cover a wide range of topics, such as suggestions for new uTrade features or voting on various developer bounty submissions. \n\nAs the GGM matures to include delegating UNFI to elect Community Council Representatives, these community referendums may take on even greater importance. Community CRs should be encouraged by UNFI delegators to monitor and participate in referendums.  Referendums provide a path for CCRs to better represent their community. \n", "choices": ["Approve", "Decline"], "start": 1616778167, "end": 1616945400, "snapshot": "12115863", "state": "closed", "author": "0x6F6DEF8732980370C137c356D7377e02d1BDF1F0", "space": {"id": "testmytoken.eth", "name": "testMyToken"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
