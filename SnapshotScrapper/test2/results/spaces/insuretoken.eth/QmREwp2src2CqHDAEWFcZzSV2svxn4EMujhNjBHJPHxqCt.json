The scammers were using a YouTube channel called ADA Foundation or Cardano Foundation, they were live with a video of Charles Hoskinson talking (he was talking in english and my english is bad), the background of the video was a website page where they promote a giveway from Cardano. All you had to do was to send them ADA and get rewarded the double.\nHere their website : https://eventada.net/ \nMinutes after transfering funds to them, I realised it was a scam by doing a research, so I locked my Binance Account in order to block the transfer but it was too late. \n\nI've sent 14178 Cardano to them and lost all, the value was around 18000$ at that time.\n\nTextID of the transaction : \nhttps://cardanoscan.io/transaction/d707fca6f16fff3dfb066b3005d431e72efb0d36db4faf4f2d3de3b272b57064 \n\nThe transaction happened on block 5400632 : \nhttps://cardanoscan.io/block/5400632 \n\nScammers wallet address :\naddr1q93f8sg6fc42g0uknvleazds40vm3vyewcxggxucn2hgjwlxap7jts8kygvh08fu5v57z693uh8wsxn80wy3g9c3fzrsw7ytdw \n\n\nI hold more than 160k inSure token and I want the PRO plan insurance. \n\n\n\nPs : I found your project like the Universe wanted me to see it, you're my only hope to recover my fund.\n\n[Resolution] \nThe insurance plan only becomes effective after 7 days of the SURE tokens being placed into the private wallet. The requester has placed the tokens into the private wallet 05/03/2021, the incident has happened 28/02/2021. The insurance claim is invalid.\n\nDear members, please be aware!
