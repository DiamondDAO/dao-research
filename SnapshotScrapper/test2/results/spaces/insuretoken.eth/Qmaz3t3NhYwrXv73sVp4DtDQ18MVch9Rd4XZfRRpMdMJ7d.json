We can see that you currently own only 286 aHippo and <1 dHippo\n2. Only 286 could have been applicable since all other tokens were sold a long time before the claim (we require devalued tokens to be transferred to process the claim)\n3. The price per Hippo actually increased and wasn't devalued (7 days price versus current price, please see the screenshot below).\n4. We went through all the details you provided in your request and can conclusively say that your insurance claim request is not valid based on the outlined 3 points above.\nLet us know if you have any questions.", "choices": ["Understood", "Will contact on Telegram"], "start": 1609606800, "end": 1609693200, "snapshot": "12138366", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4a30e80E9111CDacE350Fa72D011967ba9514b6B", "space": {"id": "insuretoken.eth", "name": "inSure DeFi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
