Requested gas fees by network sometimes takes away a big chunk of fees that liquidity provider receives from network.\n", "choices": ["Agree with the proposal", "Agree with the amount of reward"], "start": 1635393600, "end": 1635998400, "snapshot": "13501950", "state": "closed", "author": "0xF1AC888569290590430aAfF83a7b629Bf334818d", "space": {"id": "insuretoken.eth", "name": "inSure DeFi"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
