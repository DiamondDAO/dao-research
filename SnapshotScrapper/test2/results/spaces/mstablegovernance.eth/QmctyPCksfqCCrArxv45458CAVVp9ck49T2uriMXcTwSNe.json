{"id": "QmctyPCksfqCCrArxv45458CAVVp9ck49T2uriMXcTwSNe", "title": "Contractual Upgrade for Cat Herders", "body": "Following up on [this successful internal motion](https://snapshot.org/#/mstabledao.eth/proposal/QmZphn4YF4jzKH5imfTSWV21uUeZkMvK8L3BWAZSCjsoqS) by the mStableDAO, it is hereby proposed that the current Cat Herders for the ProtocolDAO ([dimsome](https://forum.mstable.org/u/dimsome)) and mStableDAO ([mZeroNine](https://forum.mstable.org/u/mzeronine)) receive an upgrade to their existing work contract that currently has them employed for ca 2hrs/day for the respective DAO into a more demanding role that will increase the workload to 3 full days per week (8hrs/day), and eventually arrive at a full-time role that will have them work 5 full days per week (8hrs/day) as Cat Herders for the respective DAO.\n\nThis proposal specifically wishes to ratify the change of occupation from the current role of ca 2 hours/day into the above-mentioned half-time role of working 3 full days per week for the respective DAO. This change will add further responsibilities and an increased compensation to the role, with a brief summary of the key facts given below:\n\n**Start date**\u00a0- July 1st, 2021\n\n**Compensation**\u00a0- 2500 mUSD & an additional 2k USD monthly paid in MTA, calculated from the 30 days VWAP of the previous month. This will be paid on the 10th of every month\u00a0(or the closest workday following if the 10th falls on a weekend or holiday) from the mStable Fund Manager wallet which in turn receives the funds from the mStableDAO treasury\n\nBoth cat herders voluntarily commit to locking all MTA rewards received in the mStable staking contract for at least 12 months from the commencement of this new and upgraded contract, including the migration from the legacy v1 contract to the new v2 contract in September. This means that all MTA rewards can be redeemed at the earliest on the **1st of July 2022**.\n\n**Roles and responsibilities**\n\n- c.8hrs per day, 3 times per week allocated toward making sure the mStableDAOs and ProtocolDAOs governance processes run smoothly. This includes:\n- Maintenance of open communication threads on public channels such as the forum and Discord\n- Organising and conducting DAO signer calls and maintaining curated records of these meetings\n- Making sure DAO signers reach quorum to execute\u00a0transactions in a timely\u00a0manner\n- Managing proposal workflows to ensure they are voted on and discussed when they need to be\n- Writing & posting on the snapshot pages as a comms representative for the DAO\n- Compile and consolidate internal signer feedback in regards to the respective DAO\n- Calibrate between the different DAOs of the mStable ecosystem to ensure smooth day-to-day operations\n- Maintain and continue building out the respective internal Notion page for the respective DAO\n- Acting as a liaison between the wider mStable community and it's Community Manager (Lord of the Discord) and the respective DAOs\n\n**Independence\u00a0from the mStable Genesis team & small print**\u00a0- This role is performed for the mStableDAO and ProtocolDAO respectively on the behalf of the mStable Community and all stakeholders. \n\nAll proposals, messages, decisions, and other legally and otherwise binding actions that originate from the respective Cat Herders are done exclusively on behalf of the respective DAOs and mStable community as a whole and do in no way reflect the opinions or wishes of the persons acting in this role.\n\n**Next Steps** - If successful, both Cat Herders will commence work in the upgraded role as described above and continue in this role until the proposal for a full-time position resolves, which will not happen later than the **1st of September 2021**. This intermediate step is present to ensure that the increased workloads are ramping up slowly and gradually, and that both Cat Herders have adequate time to adjust and accommodate themselves with the new responsibilities prior to the full-time commitment.\n\nSince this proposal marks a financial gain for both Cat Herders, they will abstain with both their personal and public wallets on this proposal.\n\nThe option with the most votes will be executed, even if it doesn't reach an absolute majority.\n\n**Should dimsome and mZeroNine have their contracts upgraded to the above mentioned half-time role as Cat Herders and provide them with the compensation and additional workloads outlined?**", "choices": ["Yes, approve & upgrade the roles", "Yes, but revise the conditions", "No, do
