In addition, the manual harvesting of AAVE\u2019s liquidity mining reward is complex and convoluted. Therefore, we propose a new strategy to automatically harvest AAVE\u2019s liquidity mining reward and reinvest to the same strategy pool.\n\nWithout l2.finance and our strategy, a regular Aave lender would have to manually interact with the Aave incentives controller, the Aave staking controller, the Uniswap router, and the Aave lending pool contracts separately to compound the gains. One can only imagine how much higher the operational headache and cost it would incur.\n\nWe propose to deploy the newly upgraded strategies for all supported stable coins. In the meantime, we will manually harvest the stkAAVE from the V1 strategies and seed the V2 strategies with the gains.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe strategy first claims the stkAAVE from Aave\u2019s incentive controller contract, it then activates the cooldown period for unstaking, which is currently set to 10 days by Aave. After the cooldown expires, the strategy unstakes the stkAAVE and converts them back to AAVE. It also claims the accrued AAVE interest from staking during the cooldown period. It then sells the AAVE obtained from the into the stablecoins on Uniswap back into the stablecoins and re-invests them into Aave, compounding the gains.\n\nIn summary, the sequence of operations is:\n\nCooldown \u2192 Unstake \u2192 Claim interest \u2192 Sell AAVE into stablecoins \u2192 Re-invest into Aave\n\nAll of the above operations can be performed by anyone simply calling the harvest() function on the strategy every cooldown period, and the gains are automatically compounded for all layer2.Finance users who have deposited funds into the strategy. All of the complexity is completely hidden from our end users and they don\u2019t even have to perform any action.\n\nSecurity note\n\nWe have reached out to Celer team and did a code review. However, the code is not audited by third-party yet. If approved, we will work with Celer team to get a third-party audit for this strategy at a later date.\n\nWhat we are asking in return\n\nNothing, we are a group of developer interested in L2 technology and will make goodwill contribution at first. We will prove our work first before asking anything from the community.", "choices": ["Yay", "Nay"], "start": 1622080200, "end": 1622425800, "snapshot": "12513319", "state": "closed", "author": "0xF5e9D550C3c50364D630eDB4753bE404Cd109121", "space": {"id": "celernetwork.eth", "name": "Celer Network"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmP6Ryxt5Znjx2oKBPhEGC7HqoRDoGv6HafPT41Qy3Tea7", "voter": "0x635343660F339950999C9470b4a0928c7794850E", "created": 1622268604, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "celernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQGHBU5bFgCHcgwmvXKUMvezo6XkFWwqkMyeh1VrnuSQY", "voter": "0x3B5B9D4C8926ECA9D053fB5Fe1D4a44933752176", "created": 1622148937, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "celernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNzYpNcwoVopKXyPkSkgeLxuvnfdUaMDC4BYGrpoAFLQu", "voter": "0x3f4CA538F22c23feeaCDf4667Dffa9a72C2a7903", "created": 1622147726, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "celernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXMmh9msoWhH8Zio7emD787Ey3MJoUWBFJMTSBo6ZheC7", "voter": "0xCca1b1F8c4292f96756d8BaC3a015359033DddcE", "created": 1622082547, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "celernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVM2uDnGGJtHwGDMnvNuvyuS4GsyX6pr7mGUsNZnMMaX8", "voter": "0x507e9Ff7D17E18eA215568dD70D6f4C550ED20Fc", "created": 1622082529, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "celernetwork.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZsjC6CMNN9nv2J5CDQnKgzMyUMMg48h5hd8Kwf3CbuJR", "voter": "0xCEC0165cD935e28992ABc7a2F3Ae0ab360c3B41c", "created": 1622082501, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "celernetwork.eth"}}]}
