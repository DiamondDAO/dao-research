Fair enough that the majority of those is not used widely, nevertheless there are thousands of projects deployed on ETH with a certain right to exist and special usecase.\n\nTo gain the attraction of more stakers and thus more usage, AnyStake should concentrate on the listing of new Tokes/coins which are\n\n(almost) UniSwap only - mainly Dex traded\nhave no own single-staking incentive. It also does not hurt if the project is in an actual Hype.\nThis proposal does not declare that list of all below-mentioned tokens have to be listed. It also not imposes to follow the 2 above criteria.\nThis proposal clearly states the very urgency of new listings. In comparison with \"AIP-1 Equalizinh the DFT Rewards over all VIP Pools\" this should not harm the project. Also, big Tier1-CEX listed projects should be listed, if the expected \"readiness-to-stake\" is high. Connected with AIP-1, there is no risk of creating as many as possible pools.\nOf course, at some point of new tokens, the frontend presentation should be optimized in a way that token can be found easily, e.g. tabular-wise with its oracle price in the same line as APY indication will not be necessary anymore if every pool has the same APY. (API-1)\n\nEach new Listing should also go along with a decent marketing offensive via social media channel in the way as other projects announce their new partnerships. A nice-looking announcement Design Template can be created to present those new listings to a wider audience via Twitter.
