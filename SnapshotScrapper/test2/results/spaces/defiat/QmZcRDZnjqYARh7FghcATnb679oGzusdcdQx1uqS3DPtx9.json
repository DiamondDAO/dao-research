That leads to the situation that new pools have crazy high APY and there is a reasonable risk of draining out DFT if only a few ppl are staking there. Also, other pool rewards will be reduced.\n\nThe Proposal is to change the actual dynamic reward allocation to the VIP pools of external ERC20 assets. The Goal is that for each block the new DFT should be distributed according to the complete overall oracle price balance weighted amount of the VIP pools.\n\nFairest reward system possible\nThis would mean that all VIP pools will always have the same APY and it would not differ any more for any willing Staker which pool he chooses. The pure need of staking his ERC20 asset is important. So all stakers will have the same APY and it would equalize the complete system to be the fairest reward system possible. The resulting APY would be quite attractive nevertheless and would attract even more people hence their now filled pools become comparable lucrative again.\n\nNo pool competition anymore\nThis in the end would lead to the situation that there will be no pool competition anymore. Just the pure idea of staking. Also, Pool competition is now holding back new stakers as they see other pools with higher APY but not their token. The idea of different APY for every pool is in the end contradicting the fundamental concept of staking any ERC20 Token.\n\nEasy Listing of New Pools\nIn addition, new pools can be easily listed without the dilemma of DFT diluting risk for too high APYs. So we can really bring as much as ERC20 assets to AnyStake as we wish. Since the rewards are only distributed on the single staking worth equalized over all VIP pools.\n\nAs crypto is originally be created to bring fairness to the people, this concept would definitely bring Anystake to the attention of crypto purists. I am sure that there are other advantages which I have missed here.", "choices": ["Let' go for it.", "Nah, sounds not useful.", "DEVs, How would't be possible?"], "start": 1620036000, "end": 1632996000, "snapshot": "12362555", "state": "closed", "author": "0x3fF657d5f90c4872872c12C5f2f38b8Da9138a1f", "space": {"id": "defiat", "name": "DeFiat"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSCED45QriSfNGJsgx4r56CCjgsqgK21ohA1EGdZAZXDV", "voter": "0xBeF1FeFE4Bb6DDA516E9Af3A3F793d182cf053Bc", "created": 1620222173, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "defiat"}}, {"id": "QmQ2Vz5ZdVuj1iqbCZhNP3mxM5DBiUWJuMmdHhZfTB7y5x", "voter": "0x3fF657d5f90c4872872c12C5f2f38b8Da9138a1f", "created": 1620062763, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "defiat"}}]}
