{"id": "QmSLg9MX9EzZoBMS5G8TpWkD7gRb8LjuiBEFFW21XzRxfE", "title": "Further Development Proposal", "body": "Due to known circumstances, there is actual no further development progress of AnyStake Product neither the DeFiat Ecosystem. As both devs have personal issues holding them from work on the progress, the community needs to know HOW further development can be achieved.\n\nIt is not important which dev had which responsibilities as it was obviously not possible to give the community a valid statement on how to proceed by any dev on their own. All hope that at least one dev will soon feel better resp. more responsible to literally come back to the community.\n\nThe Proposal is the following:\nThere should be still at least 30k DFT in Marketing pool. This amount should be taken reasonably to hire a dev or dev group with the clear order of executing community-developed Improvements of AnySyake and new use cases of DFT.\n\nThis would mean that original devs don't have to code again, they would just fall back into the role of a supervisor of produced code. We could even create community testing of new versions/products by interested and capable members.\n\nWe can and should also execute a \"Call for AnyStake Improvements\" and \"Call for New DeFiat use cases\"  with a  DFT reward of the best three. It would be great to have a competition of ideas to bring this project forward as the brand and tokenomics are extremely strong and where to reason for the huge 1st huge demand.\n\nOf course, devs have to agree on that. But as more and more ppl are voting with yes, the more the devs shall act as a community-driven project as promised.", "choices": ["Hire Devs!
