This service must cost a specific amount of DFT to be put in reward pool or to be burnt.\n\nA fee-wall for applying new pools is very important to prevent users from spamming new pools just for fun.\n\nThought through this system would lead to stake any ERC20 assets as long as the used oracle can find a price for that Token. In that way AnyStake can use really any ERC20 Token which would perfectly fit to the brand Promise. Also DFT has a new in the bif picture fiting usecase.\n\nThe application should be a two step process.\n\nToken Adress check - is a oracle price is to be found (without that no reward allocation is possible)\npool creation by confirming usage of DFT from User. The creation should cost a specific DFT amount from user which should come directly from the users wallet. For example 10 DFT\nAfter pool is created, all users are welcome to stake their tokens.\n\nAt best a telegram bot should listen to the pools created (according to the trade listener bot) and puts a announcement message into the DeFiat Group which can be used for Marketing as described in AIP-2.", "choices": ["I love it.
