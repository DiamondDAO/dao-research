Due to market conditions, the idea of doing a sort of deflationary event as an ICO on our very own platform surfaced. This would mean holders could commit BREW on BSC in order to receive the new token on Polygon (still not clear if it will be pegged or not). This would mean a lot of BSC BREW would be burnt, part of it could also be used to buy back some MOCHA, either to burn or for the team to use in marketing or CEX listings. If pegged, ICO participants would receive a bonus. How would you prefer it to be?", "choices": ["100% BREW burn", "75% BREW burn, 25% MOCHA BuyBack", "Same as #2 but with MOCHA BURN", "No ICO, bridge token (if pegged)", "Fair launch (if not pegged)"], "start": 1626130740, "end": 1626476340, "snapshot": "9103475", "state": "closed", "author": "0xC910DfC7c06b766113c7a0B6B3ee67ab0Bed18a7", "space": {"id": "cafeswapfinance.eth", "name": "CafeSwap.Finance"}, "votes": 8, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQMCUwMJcFYpydJYpzEJAH7gJWrT7BMQGyT1ZYscrnthf", "voter": "0xE3b19C505031168437bFd71BbB1A77F11f2D2CB3", "created": 1626392854, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cafeswapfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbzVy6XnmqwgmVMUFwL7uGt3mrShszsSJxkjfvDqSxHZz", "voter": "0x4266B2B89c0dce021Eb81f51e8279a86a5e92421", "created": 1626232815, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cafeswapfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZkyamagjBgoALd7sZfRui8EoJVa67wVH2E8dXch4jBFR", "voter": "0x9585205bF3D23b1fF9e80100e9a8204Cf467c226", "created": 1626213914, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cafeswapfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcnCpcSTEA6yFb8DJvD8Sy9sSJhBD35DxB9TdC8mJv2mx", "voter": "0x8D7e3E494F7777E78c5E2e25B31e218DEF3cD971", "created": 1626161582, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cafeswapfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmV9aKEhtmK8Hvkrm8V5UgUrffipZj6mRk3V6SSvsxJSFE", "voter": "0xfD5a83998079ed1935F246F3caDd7eE3138cB91a", "created": 1626159758, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cafeswapfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfWr5m68ve4ZmTuWeEut3r1iwpxM4EnTjWPw1fDBX3W15", "voter": "0xC910DfC7c06b766113c7a0B6B3ee67ab0Bed18a7", "created": 1626158682, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "cafeswapfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUgvSyD6rrRjUbsbYDzewfBfj1N8i8spUs9gxzvWQUfTb", "voter": "0x130c94ac8f710EE070951e0d961D3c0fC4715f40", "created": 1626153066, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cafeswapfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRcmp3CnvnaYr4ybRbdgVjhMdxiPCv8hzyzpMRcRJsGy6", "voter": "0x8eB8896A92A644431383F796905A5d0209C76586", "created": 1626133310, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cafeswapfinance.eth"}}]}
