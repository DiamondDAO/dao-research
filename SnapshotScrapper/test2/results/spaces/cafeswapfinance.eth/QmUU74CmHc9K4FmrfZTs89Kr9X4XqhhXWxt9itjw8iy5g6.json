I'd like to propose to feed the lottery from the collected fees. We can feed the BREW lottery with a part of the 9% minting treasury and the BUSD lottery from collected fees on the DEX (sell collected BNB, TWT, DOT, etc. and feed it into the lottery). I don't advise to sell any BREW to feed the BUSD lottery.\n\nWhen the prize pools are bigger then more people will play the lottery, which will burn more BREW and reduce the circulating supply.", "choices": ["Feed the lotteries", "Don't feed the lotteries"], "start": 1616734800, "end": 1617080400, "snapshot": "6125000", "state": "closed", "author": "0xcb8156099D5F9906AeC56142F317F648Ae50dD21", "space": {"id": "cafeswapfinance.eth", "name": "CafeSwap.Finance"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmavH5drLYao5zcvpXgiKs4EXQNub8GzMavxtSHZPDLUoN", "voter": "0x9537aD1FCB79E3F9738F607700f14f53Db89d9f7", "created": 1617025558, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cafeswapfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWjJVX24fRaYUWoMhc5R5yMJyJmDtnzeLsdKDCDVgEN6H", "voter": "0x09a6b7b62B16232C03c2a4E4aEE21cAE234547C7", "created": 1616997046, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cafeswapfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmajmRayYVVBQYe5iKsJchxJrUGY6twvP9Jp5iEbVa1pVw", "voter": "0xf99c642de74d70A60C824D78d8F045684002F3c6", "created": 1616783117, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cafeswapfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNTPSaM12iKR2UawnVeEBvvENaNxCfGjpTsYZqbf5HLau", "voter": "0xcb8156099D5F9906AeC56142F317F648Ae50dD21", "created": 1616746133, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cafeswapfinance.eth"}}]}
