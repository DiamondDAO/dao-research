", "body": "The Biswap team constantly searches for new ways of advancement and analyses the DeFi industry. Via the precise evaluation, it is vivid that the market is moving in the prospect of such spheres: NFT (Earn), GameFi (Play to Earn), and Strategic Partnerships between strong projects. Those spheres have epic volumes and thousands of active users on Binance Smart Chain.\n\nThe team thoroughly monitors requests from the Biswap community and has received a great number of requests concerning the implementation of new directions which are highly popular in DeFi.\n\nEach one of you is the main navigator in the development of the global Biswap DEX. All your support inspires us to make aims real. Your active participation in the decision-making with Biswap like the Community Voting has shown incredible result: Binance Labs has officially announced the strategic investment in the improvement of Biswap!\n\nSuch outcomes of the synergy between the project and community when both support one idea motivates us to reach even higher peaks and we are extremely grateful for all of that!\n\nDue to the reason that together we look in the same direction and you support our decisions, we want to evolve in popular directions like NFT (Earn), GameFi (Play to Earn), and Strategic Partnerships.\n\nAdvantages of the Biswap evolvement in the popular directions:\n\ud83c\udf10 Powerful and greater Biswap ecosystem\n\ud83c\udf10 New levels and records in DeFi\n\ud83c\udf10 Strengthening of the BSW token\n\ud83c\udf10 Involvement of thousands of new users to Biswap DEX\n\ud83c\udf10 Lucrative opportunities for community\n\ud83c\udf10 Huge partnerships possibilities\n\ud83c\udf10 Greater volumes and statistics\n\ud83c\udf10 BSW token burnings\n\nThe Path of Implementing New Biswap Directions \nSuccessful releases require a substantial amount of resources. In order to release the prospective directions of NFT (Earn), GameFi (Earn to Play), and Strategic Partnerships in the Biswap ecosystem, it is necessary to affect the BSW tokenomics by redistributing 70 mln BSW tokens for those purposes.\n\nIn the meantime, 6 mln BSW tokens got used, during 5 months, out of 100 mln BSW tokens allocated for Transaction Fee Mining (Fee Return) in BSW tokenomics. We see that this amount is a lot for the Fee Return. By taking the dynamic speed of development of the DeFi sector into account, we offer: redistribute 70 mln BSW from the Transaction Fee Mining pool. \n\n\ud83d\udccdThis amount will be redistributed gradually over a substantial period.\n\nSo, 24 mln  BSW will be left for Fee Return after Biswap uses 70 mln to expand the ecosystem of the project and provide new products for Biswappers. The future depiction of Biswap tokenomics in favor of new Biswap directions only shows that modifications won\u2019t negatively influence users\u2019 earnings or opportunities on Biswap.\n\nThe BSW tokenomics could be modified in the following way:\n\nMax Supply: 700 000 000 BSW tokens\n\n600 mln  BSW tokens are allocated as follows:\n\n80.7% \u2014 Farms & Launchpools\n4.3 % \u2014 Referral Program\n5 % \u2014 Investment Fund\n1 % \u2014 SAFU (Security Asset Fund for Users)\n9 % \u2014 Team\n\n\n100 mln BSW tokens will be distributed:\n70 mln BSW for NFT (Earn), GameFi (Play to Earn), and Strategic Partnerships\n30 mln BSW for Transaction Fee Mining.\n \nThe rest of the Fee Return pool left after the changes in BSW tokenomics (24 mln BSW tokens) is a substantial amount that will continue to reward Biswappers, along with mighty NFT (Earn), GameFi (Play to Earn), and Strategic Partnerships releases implemented for further globalization of the Biswap DEX!\nHere are the proposals:\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 Option 1: Improve the tokenomics and help the project rapidly grow:\n80.7% - Farms & Launchpools\n4.3 % - Referral Program\n5 % - Investment Fund\n1% - SAFU (Security Asset Fund for Users)\n9% - Team\n100 mln BSW tokens from Fee Return will distributed:\n70 mln BSW for NFT (Earn), GameFi (Play to Earn) and Strategic Partnerships\n30 mln BSW for Transaction Fee Mining.\n\u274c Option 2: Keep the tokenomics as it is:\n80.7% - Farms & Launchpools\n4.3 % - Referral Program\n5 % - Investment Fund\n1% - SAFU (Security Asset Fund for Users)\n9% - Team\n100 mln BSW tokens from Fee Return will be kept with no integration of new direction for Biswap.\nTerms & Conditions\nThe voting period is 5 (five) days\nThe choice that will accumulate more than 51% of votes or exactly 51% will win the voting.\nOnce voted, you will not be able to vote again.\nThere is no need to unstake your BSW tokens from Farms and/or Launchpools to vote. The system will automatically sum up all your tokens on the wallet, and the ones that are locked in Farms & Launchpools. Your BSW tokens will stay with you.\nIf you are unable to vote on the Biswap Voting page, please vote on the snapshot.\nBSW tokens which have been staked in the AIRT, ZOON, PCT Launchpools do not participate in the voting.", "choices": ["\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 Improve the tokenomics", "\u274cKeep the tokenomics as it is"], "start": 1635266580, "end": 1635271200, "snapshot": "12110933", "state": "closed", "author": "0xdBE55A0daDc80EF88e884f15CE41c26c0Af933a0", "space": {"id": "testbsw.eth", "name": "testbsw"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSjvKGTVYfqA7ARbRtJa5x6qx7HQzrekcDoFmR6VqqcKj", "voter": "0xdBE55A0daDc80EF88e884f15CE41c26c0Af933a0", "created": 1635266672, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "testbsw.eth"}}]}
