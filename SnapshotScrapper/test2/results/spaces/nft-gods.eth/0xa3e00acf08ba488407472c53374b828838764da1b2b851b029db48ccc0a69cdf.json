In particular, the initially set output time of 500 days for LG tokens limited the development cycle and usage scenarios of LG.\n\nAs the only core token of the NFT-GODS ecosystem, it's time for us to consider some adjustments to the economic model. For the total amount of LG tokens, it will always remain the same at 200 million. For the output rate of NFT mining, we decided to use a poll to solicit the community's opinion to make adjustments.\n\nThe basic idea is to extend the NFT-GODS operating cycle similar to Bitcoin's cyclical reduction scheme, so that the ecological development of NFT-GODS can be extended. Don't worry, no matter what the final result of the vote is, we will respect the community's opinion, while preparing appropriate countermeasures to solidify the next development of NFT-GODS.\n\n1. 50% reduction in production immediately, and 50% reduction every three months thereafter.\n2. 30% reduction in production immediately, and 30% reduction every three months thereafter.\n3. Keep the current production of NFT mining unchanged.\n\nPlease cast your precious vote against the yield adjustment of NFT mining, which may decide the future of NFT-GODS.\n\nThank you for your vote!\n \nSnapshot time: November 5, 2021, 12:00 UTC", "choices": ["50% reduction in production", "30% reduction in production", "Keep the current production"], "start": 1636113600, "end": 1636286400, "snapshot": "12385900", "state": "closed", "author": "0x003e8a3d9ca4849dfd92Ecd020D7f0c02C3E439c", "space": {"id": "nft-gods.eth", "name": "NFT-GODS"}, "votes": 11, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x66c3adc0e128d20eba4dee41d57bb5022a4b2bf99c88e6bd62659a3697d73ae0", "voter": "0x41C77c50E9FC9C1fCCB35355d264F029D017a883", "created": 1636271440, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "nft-gods.eth"}}, {"id": "0x1f28deaded3dfb2926a7c24a385cff8ea70b7c3a18658e6b0bf4e5e950b2f545", "voter": "0x073C2Ad6cBE960EB9Dd6D0fEa748597179A9F930", "created": 1636187252, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "nft-gods.eth"}}, {"id": "0x5db29248216e2ea65ccde42ba9072317c8a28333aae790a9f9c7bc057221479c", "voter": "0x062551d1293E85dAa174722DeC8b1F9E9Da1D88C", "created": 1636186130, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "nft-gods.eth"}}, {"id": "0x405951dcca2a16065fcb5561fe621727d9f2a8b1f4b89788d4004e1572c60a77", "voter": "0xC5F7c3dFc016eB3B463d382A99dCBD0408626708", "created": 1636162214, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "nft-gods.eth"}}, {"id": "0x40f4a7315a43b237d78a0b92373150cd1383196bd911650644ee391992d725a8", "voter": "0x6a4026De4D716f54Eb644B443e32dc815Fa50032", "created": 1636161580, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "nft-gods.eth"}}, {"id": "0x5b5084c10346fadc90f211d555e3f478e33f7de1c02aa8802552258f044f160e", "voter": "0xcF3ddC25D44Ae7CD49DA7fC2AD18b6a5319a0389", "created": 1636158019, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "nft-gods.eth"}}, {"id": "0x8783995f55d3522f06591e71af3c1fdf739b7d8aaaa519a7c8bd71e468573a06", "voter": "0xEf964790713336464D2837c293a25be439912ef7", "created": 1636157260, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft-gods.eth"}}, {"id": "0xebc06e3bbd3b54dda17ad72b362e6d6a87b05ff1404e3b01c2ba29b438189baa", "voter": "0x0D105421b1227832e703415c68AB32A800B95798", "created": 1636129646, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "nft-gods.eth"}}, {"id": "0x0347fed9ad5d5a9671389e3787e6c9030795d377470ea126720f8f8c855cb310", "voter": "0xF147Cdcb119C9adE69Ac23f2b2e79cAc6f9bF7c8", "created": 1636124151, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "nft-gods.eth"}}, {"id": "0x8da119e7e93039143c51ecc4cb12a9d4d9909682c11a1278b8615b33f95d0275", "voter": "0x7f0f6b29BD298aAEbE6D384F499aE7239A4B0dFa", "created": 1636123768, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "nft-gods.eth"}}, {"id": "0x820a0e04f2fd5dfc9028e7a330b237237111992177eeae9b0b8853603e777ead", "voter": "0x52c1Aa1d82d01982d68864Df1374362B2a0f926C", "created": 1636123540, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "nft-gods.eth"}}]}
