Doing so would result in a new pool (ICEBRK/ICEDOGE) with only one token being taxed on trading (so total of 8% fee rather than 2x) as well as increase the overall liquidity depth for our project. \n\nArbitrage would keep the three pools in relative sync with prices and should theoretically increase the transactional volume as a result, which means more reflect rewards.\n\nTo create the new liquidity pool we would allocate some ICEDOGE tokens from the \"Reserve Fund\" which currently stands at approximately 8,000,000 ICEDOGE, or 8% of total supply. The ICEBRK tokens would have to come from the ICEBRK DAO Treasury, which is holding around 148 Trillion tokens, or 14.8% of total supply. The addition of liquidity is done at a 50/50 ratio determined by the market value at the time of creation.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1631812500, "end": 1632071700, "snapshot": "10969699", "state": "closed", "author": "0x30bc20753b325C7F7B3e55daEB464C348C5e8096", "space": {"id": "icebrk.eth", "name": "Icebreak-R"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZ5ZWryJndmbKkj2qBURfFrEfVbdt2eeb9b6JiRrfCfFm", "voter": "0xa908B6B5247d83Fc8f4856fAaCb9Cb5df30E7Cbd", "created": 1632004750, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "icebrk.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbGtMZrVK3CvqspvzG9W7dRX6vN48EXUuwBDa2ehQcCsc", "voter": "0x721700d0DC44058B8Dc855840464489210Ca1457", "created": 1631982863, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "icebrk.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUNMcTPxM157jnS5NeFdNgHsu5S7yBnnXsbpvDXVVhiQP", "voter": "0xEF33B0a1cB7Be922cFf7AE76337a43Dc99d2D225", "created": 1631912840, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "icebrk.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSRz1J6j2FXwF6ypdDFwXqSH5Y6tNPjmN8jvZu6C4iyku", "voter": "0x30bc20753b325C7F7B3e55daEB464C348C5e8096", "created": 1631812889, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "icebrk.eth"}}]}
