To achieve that, we need to hire a dedicated team that will lead the protocol.\n\nMany blockchain protocols have taken a similar approach. Sushi, for example, have hired a team of core developers, the decision that has led to their tremendous growth.\n\nThis proposal is inspired by Sushi\u2019s approach.\n\n# Our Approach\n\nOur first challenge has been to find a top-tier team that buys into our vision and is ready to dedicate themselves entirely to Based Loans. The second challenge was finding the financial resources to pay salaries while not having to sell tokens over the counter to interested investors.\n\nAfter many days of careful searching and interviewing, we have found a highly skilled team of six individuals who have agreed to take on the responsibility of leading the protocol and receive their pay fully in Based Loans Ownership tokens ($BLO).\n\nWe believe paying the team in $BLO aligns the interest of the team and community: the team is now fully dedicated to innovating, shipping product fast, and creating a solid market position, believing it will lead to a significant increase in the token value, reflecting positively on the community and token holders.\n\n# Voting\n\nYou are voting to allocate resources to:\n\n1- Fill in 6 positions\n\n2- Allocate operational budget\n\n***FOR:*** Based Loans will have a dedicated leadership team that will work with the community hand in hand to take the protocol to a leading market position.\n\n***AGAINST:*** Token holders will need to find another organizational mechanism to lead technology, product, and marketing.\n\n## Job Position\n\n### Ghoul.sol: Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\n\nAs most of you know, I'm one of the founding ghouls. I've been handling all our smart contracts needs since pool 0. I've been leading the technology, assembling the rock-star team for Based Loans, and writing smart contracts from the beginning. The team asked me to assume a CTO position and I'm happy to do so if y'all have me.

Rate chosen for this voting is $0.1175 per BLO.\n- Salaries are paid strictly in $BLO.\n- Each salary is streamed on sablier.finance.\n- 1-month vesting is applied on each stream in case of a misfit hire.\n- The duration of each hiring contract is 6 months renewable upon voting a new proposal.\n\n# Operating Expenses Budget\n\nThe team would like to have an operating budget to cover recurring expenses for the next 6 to 12 months. Expenses include, hosting, dev tools, freelance payments, and more. All recurring expenses have so far been paid by the founding team and few community members.\n\nHaving the budget available to the team, similar to what other projects do, helps move the protocol fast and prevent delays in carrying out important tasks.\n\nBudget (6-12 Months) : 600,000 BLO", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1623960000, "end": 1624219200, "snapshot": "12653960", "state":
