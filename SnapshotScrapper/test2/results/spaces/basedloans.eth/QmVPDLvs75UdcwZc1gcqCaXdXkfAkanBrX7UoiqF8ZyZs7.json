We all experienced a pretty sizable dip recently across the whole market. I think that's going to scare some people and possibly lead to more people adopting wider indexes as hedges and sources of liquidity. Lets tap that. I like indexed finance a lot, seem pretty based and stable. Also... shhh... i got a secret plan... we gonna sneak our based asses into that nft platform index (NFTP). They'll be all like \"oh snap thanks for having our coins on your market, we really appreciate you ghouls\" and we'll be all like \" no problem we got you bros, y'all are based and what not\"... then we hit em with the Columbo \"oh and more thing...\" super sneaky guaranteed success lol but even if that doesn't happen, they're good indexes (I suggest we pass on ERROR he went hard in BDP... trust me not worth touching that, not even as a meme, it was not a \"big dick play\" like I though it would be).\n\nI would like to see it used as collateral and if at all possible have some of the deposit staked in indexed as well (withdrawal fees maybe to pay for weighted and timed contract calls or just gassy pulls individually idk and don't care really). Getting some NDX rewards rolling into the treasury wouldn't be too bad for the platform, (I will be proposing a similar setup with pickle). Having the mechanisms as well for daily, weekly or monthly locked deposits would be cool and would give us some ways to build treasury to build things with. Of course we would have the same risks as any staker, could go belly up but... lets just call them V2 markets like curve does lol whatever just pass the buck to the button clicker, as is industry standard now. Don't know what's possible given the comp fork nature but seems like a move to me.\n\nI'm making the voting window pretty long so the Ghouls don't have to even look at it till after the polygon launch and I want feedback for sure... i mean look at this proposal lol I'm a terrible technical writer and it's a big platform change.", "choices": ["Add NDX indexes", "Option 1 & Develop deposit locks", "Nah... not Based enough", "I guess just deposit locks?"], "start": 1624180800, "end": 1626772800, "snapshot": "12660674", "state": "closed", "author": "0x604115C5E484FD8ADfd79123817e48257c96a925", "space": {"id": "basedloans.eth", "name": "Based Loans"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qme9FZCBQ4YKCMURS2MqVqnxG6EtmL3VNDrNH9quMFRAvh", "voter": "0x48AacA81C945e1E84da4d662E0De579522BEF4C6", "created": 1624981187, "choice": 3, "space": {"id": "basedloans.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVsrvLGdC94MdFKg5fdUnj2kc986VNz3aUravxsqZhZiB", "voter": "0x604115C5E484FD8ADfd79123817e48257c96a925", "created": 1624964434, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "basedloans.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZfgJdNT9qEX7CFEByGw2p6DB5a95EKrMT3rYcHiqkQ7W", "voter": "0x2a0059610c92842DC2eF84aF76b244C28687e647", "created": 1624425505, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basedloans.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWRTWxjHekWvQNcV6g3sU1VwHKtqMSLGv9wyVV9jLevGV", "voter": "0x9d524829019E3549C19675f80203CC389Fb77383", "created": 1624374348, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basedloans.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcBoHrUjFb6sPf1kZcjtW4hrH5QtWdSxCj47VkTo6sCxM", "voter": "0x93951DaDD4d77d6a12cdfee14aC0343Aca45d2ad", "created": 1624352664, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basedloans.eth"}}]}
