Give Malt true believers a way to earn yield on their malt (there is no malt staking right now)\n\n2. Give Malt disbelievers a way to short this shitcoin if they think its going to be ded in a weeek.\n\nOn this market I feel speed is of the essence, which is why I'm doing this snapshot now even though the community is also actively discussing what markets to add.\n\nVote yay or nay to signal to the ghouls whether we should do this or no.\n", "choices": ["Yes, list MALT", "No, don't list MALT"], "start": 1623297600, "end": 1623513540, "snapshot": "15573634", "state": "closed", "author": "0x4161eab0b7d555298AdC4F40FA0C524dd2E596Fc", "space": {"id": "basedloans.eth", "name": "Based Loans"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmPVvL769eBuFeojZEy4cwYE6v1iaewyQrhcureYYApy2T", "voter": "0xcfc14D1dc16F9c737355b678442d7491DC5183bC", "created": 1623451180, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "basedloans.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYa5w6Hb5XzycKNhF7ZAgHL1Dse3L7gAWVzLx1Y792R6D", "voter": "0x5823443272C330e1A28cEa0038e70196b785dBdd", "created": 1623432908, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "basedloans.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRwXk1RUj1G7CiS5q3eV7YPCW1m6ygBrXVkXW5szxX4TR", "voter": "0x1160387A36953aFC5d80C0Ea7b6B5447774aF8E5", "created": 1623390667, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basedloans.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdMVbHVXWpmv959Z5rSbQ1rAEBUZ7jkGnpucrH235MW1L", "voter": "0x05941c397545b80CC196FE139b989aB1Be63197C", "created": 1623390291, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basedloans.eth"}}]}
