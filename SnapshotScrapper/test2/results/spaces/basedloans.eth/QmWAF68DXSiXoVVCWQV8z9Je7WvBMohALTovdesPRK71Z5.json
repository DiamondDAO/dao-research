The platform utilizes a native $RUG token to coordinate decentralized governance and create additional incentives for artists:\nhttps://basedrugs.medium.com/introducing-based-rugs-7af158e5c5c0\n\nThe community has nearly finished Rugs. This includes a frontend, backend (with IPFS database), and recruitment of more than 30+ artists. The frontend is a specially designed webpage that uses 3D objects and Windows 95 designs to create a very unique platform experience:\nhttps://ibb.co/c207XrK\n\nWe are in the works with two protocols for future integrations of Rugs into their galleries. However, we have not received the smart contract work or heard from the smart contract developer about the status of his work, so we need to hire another contractor to finish this. We have paid roughly 20ETH in current costs on the project, but the current contractors are unable to finish the project without the smart contracts.\n\nWe are requesting 30K BLO to hire a smart contract engineer to develop a (1) token contract, (2) governance contract, which the current team is capable of testing and incorporating into the front end and Snapshot.\n\nThe incentive for the BLO communities are (1) support Based artists who have contributed a significant amount of \u201ccreative capital\u201d to the organization, which will be monetized through the Rugs platform, (2) promoting the growth of a NFT platform for future collaboration (e.g., NFT lending), (3) promoting the Based ecosystem writ large.\n", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1624381200, "end": 1624467600, "snapshot": "12688122", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7c23Ec85618C51Ab13310df4aAe8bc2DC9Cd4D38", "space": {"id": "basedloans.eth", "name": "Based Loans"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmRgieP6rcXnu6SFAUAtfzM4s5qFepYNxSuPgc1rkXPKED", "voter": "0x7c23Ec85618C51Ab13310df4aAe8bc2DC9Cd4D38", "created": 1624419880, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "basedloans.eth"}}]}
