It will not be the same vote you have expected and it may come as a surprise to you but there is a good reason behind this.\n\n## The Vote\n\nStakers will vote to use the funds put aside to either\n\n*   **VOTE: YES** support the pre-launch marketing efforts\n*   **VOTE: NO** have it returned as staking APY.\n\n## Timing\n\n*   **Snapshot** for **sFEED holders on Monday, May 24, 2021,**\u00a0**Block Number 7680000** ([https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/7680000](https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/7680000))\n*   **Voting** Tuesday, May 25, 2021, 6 AM GMT+1 \u2013 Wednesday, May 26, 2021, 6 AM GMT+1\n\n## Background\n\n*   During the time of the decision to support the vault with the funds required, we needed ~250,000 FEED to support the booster\n*   At the same time, we were ~1 month away from pre-launch marketing and this would have been a good way to get the message out with minimal materials\n*   Our token price was strong and was able to withstand farming rewards harvest\n*   All these conditions support the rationale for a vault partnership and we went ahead to ask you guys to support it too. The situation today has shifted dramatically in the other direction:\n    *   We\u2019d need +600,000 FEED (~1% of total Farming Distribution) to fund the booster\n    *   We\u2019re less than a week away from website completion, first teaser completion in a week, and we\u2019d be ready to reach out to KOLs in no more than 1.5 weeks from now; we have the materials we needed\n    *   Our token price is depressed by market conditions and current farming reward sales are depressing the price more than net demand buying can support it\n\nTherefore, as a team, we have decided not to go ahead with the vault partnership. We understand this decision may come as a surprise, especially because as you all know, we were a staunch advocate of this partnership in the first place. It was not a decision we took lightly; and do expect to disappoint some of you. However, we feel strongly that it is for the best of the community and the project.\n\nHaving said that we realize the funds we\u2019ve asked from stakers were communicated to be for the vault partnership, among other marketing uses, but the main use of funds was for the vault. \u00a0We cannot simply shift its uses without asking your permission and therefore would ask you to vote again on allowing us to proceed with those funds.\n\nThe marketing strategy itself involves the following:\n\n*   **Contacting KOLs:**\n    *   **Target Audience:** \u00a0Existing DeFi investors\n    *   **Message:** \u00a0Explaining the uses of the product, why, who, how\n        *   **Vision/Mission of the project:** \u00a0\u201cThe Gateway to DeFi\u201d / \u201cInvestors Empowered through Pooled Capital\u201d / \u201cEducational and Knowledge Community for All\u201d / \u201cHonestly, Sustainability, and Professionalism as a community and team\u201d\n*   **Platform Teaser VDO**\n    *   **Target Audience:** Completely New to DeFi\n    *   **Messaging:** We aim to relate our product strength and principles to real-world examples that allow new DeFi investors who may also be new to investing to understand why it is in their interest to use Feeder Finance. \u00a0Simplified to the core.\n*   **Product Teaser VDO**\n    *   **Target Audience:** Both DeFi and New DeFi Investors\n    *   **Messaging:** Visually walk through each of the nodes in the diagram with a verbal overlay of the investor capital flow, how, where, and why. \u00a0Making sure they both want to invest with us and see our potential as the first place (\u201cgateway\u201d) any investor world start their DeFi experience. \u00a0A place where capital can rest during turbulent times.\n\nAll of the above will be released, our hope, before the product launch. However, a balance between quality and speed is also important. That is the goal, but we\u2019d rather not sacrifice too much quality for speed so the timing may be allowed to be delayed on the media creation front.\n\nWe encourage further discussion by the community with regards to our marketing plans; but would like to ask for your understanding in regards to our pivot on the vault partnership. Please be gentle with us.\n\n## Final note\n\nWith regards to the withdrawal fee which is an issue on its own. \u00a0We do encourage discussion around that to whether we should remove it regardless of the vault partnership. \u00a0The argument for it is that it may attract more farmers, and is fairer as an economic balance between stakers and farmers.", "choices": ["YES, I SUPPORT", "NO, I DO NOT
