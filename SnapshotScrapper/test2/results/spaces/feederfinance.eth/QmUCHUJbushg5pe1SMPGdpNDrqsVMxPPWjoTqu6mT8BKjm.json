Beefy Finance itself would also attract more investors as its native token generate more aggregate yields. \u00a0Something Beefy Finance may support by_ **making this known to its investors/users.**_\n*   **ACryptoS:** ACS\u2019s native token vaults, once deposited, also give depositors a derivative, i.e.: **$acsACS**. The same pitch as Beefy Finance applies.\n*   **AutoFarm:** While **$AUTO** single-token farm deposits do not generate derivative tokens, with sufficiently attractive APR, $AUTO tokens would also become more attractive, leading to more investors buying $AUTO to stake on our farm. \u00a0Goodwill from our side and a potential co-marketing to push it.\n\nFeeder Finance sees itself as a complementary platform to all DeFi projects. \u00a0As we develop our platform, we look forward to partnerships with all established DeFi platforms and hence would like to use the tools available to us to build a solid long-term relationship. \u00a0Good relationships mean platforms work together to maximize value to investors and users; synergy can be created when projects utilize all tools available as a group.\n\nFinally, BSC remains a concentrated network when compared to ERC. \u00a0There are only a handful of players that have established themselves fully within BSC. \u00a0While this could be viewed as negative (centralized, limited optionality, limited competition), we could flip this into an opportunity. \u00a0A network of DeFi platforms working together across the blockchain to create maximum value for investors and users. \u00a0There are always two sides to a coin; it\u2019s a matter of perspective.\n\n## The following is a conservative assumption of our proposal:\n\n![](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/blob.blankcursor.com/uploads/editor_attachment/attachment/3409/TVL.png)\n\n## Our proposal to the community:\n\nWe\u2019re asking you, both farmers and stakers, to spare 10% of total farm distribution, meaning both parties lose an equal 10% of their distribution, to be used in this marketing campaign. \u00a0That 10% will be split up three ways; for $mooBIFI, $AUTO, and $acsACS farms earning $FEED rewards.\n\nOnce launched, we\u2019ll go to all these three potential partners and let them know this is going on. We\u2019re hopeful they will welcome the move. \u00a0Regardless, this will benefit vault investors/users and likely generate tangible attention towards our upcoming product launch.\n\n## The Vote:\n\n*   Snapshot will happen at block number **#8008888** ([https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/8008888](https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/8008888))\n*   We\u2019ll have a vote on this issue on **Saturday June 5, 6AM GMT+1 to Sunday June 6, 6AM GMT+1**\n*   Both **Farmers** and **Stakers** will have a say in this as it affects both pools. \u00a0\n\nPlease feel free to discuss openly. \u00a0Patrick\u2019s DM is also always open for questions and additional thoughts if needed.", "choices": ["SUPPORT NEW FARMS", "DO NOT SUPPORT NEW FARMS"], "start": 1622869200, "end": 1622955600,
