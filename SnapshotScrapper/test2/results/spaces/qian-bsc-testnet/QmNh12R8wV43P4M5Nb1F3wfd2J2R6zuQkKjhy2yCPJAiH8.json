Due to the parameters of smart contract, the release rate of KUN tokens is a 30-day uniform release and cannot be stopped or modified midway. Therefore, in the 2nd round of BSC mining, The release rate of 3,333.33 KUNs per day will remain unchanged;\n\nLiquidity incentives of the Equator trading pool, due to the faster release of KUN in the previous round (16,888 KUN/day), resulting in more selling, some community members proposed to reduce the KUN release of the Equator trading pool speed \u200b\u200bin order to appropriately stabilize the KUN price, and at the same time reduce the profitability of speculative funds, and provide higher market-making income for loyal market-making funds. Therefore, the proposal will be submitted to the community for discussion. There are currently three sets of plans, and community members need to discuss and vote on which set of plans to adopt, or create new plans:", "choices": ["Reward: 3,888 KUN/day (76.98% reduction in production), duration: 14 days", "Reward: 8,688 KUN/day (48.56% reduction in production), duration: 14 days", "Reward: 13,888 KUN/day (17.76% reduction in production), duration: 14 days"], "start": 1605593760, "end": 1605852960, "snapshot": "3710267", "state": "closed", "author": "0xDd3184946c3ad71a68e87f3e540839a9f180a1e8", "space": {"id": "qian-bsc-testnet", "name": "QIAN(BSC Testnet)"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmVumV3V82g8u293SMAq5x2FPVFGUwWDQGxxd3mP5anWia", "voter": "0xB0ad64FBB0694c22cfB6E95374DF0e70bc9713a3", "created": 1605706834, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "qian-bsc-testnet"}}]}
