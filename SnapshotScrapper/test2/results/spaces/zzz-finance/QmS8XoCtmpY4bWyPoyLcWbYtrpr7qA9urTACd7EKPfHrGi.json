I can see 2 reasons for it. First - NAPV2 doesn't have independent market place because it is pegged to ZZZV2. Thus, outside of the ZZZ community no one can see it and able to trade. Second reason is lack of use-case. By adding NAPV2 / ETH pair and implementing 0.5% burn rate we can solve these problems.
