Team members are hard at work doing maintenance  tasks such as fixing bugs or writing up articles etc. WHF is still a  ways away from putting core team members on payroll. As such this fund  is to be used for finding additional contributors and for some  reimbursements.\n  **WHF is looking for 1 UI/UX designer and a React developer.**\n- [**20NFTs.art receives 15K COMMIT**](https://forum.workhard.finance/t/20nfts-artisttoken-erc20-launchpad/21)\n  20NFTs.art is an artist token launchpad that can attract a lot of artists to  launch their token on WHF and holds great potential. 0xMayflower  proposes to grant 15K to bootstrap 20NFTs.art development.\n  \n  **20NFTs.art is looking for NFT artists who will participate, front-end developers, solidity developer, UI/UX designer.**\n- [**Yape receives 10K COMMIT**](https://forum.workhard.finance/t/yape-swap-proposal/30)\n  @ApeBuidler brought up an idea to generate yield by growing the TVL locked in the  WHF treasury combining DEX, AMM, and yield farming.. Giving grants to  Yape will return a lot of revenues to RIGHT holders since a fixed rate  of Yape VISION emission goes to WHF RIGHT holders.\n\n*Check out the proposal details at* [*Work/Projects*](https://app.workhard.finance/work)*, anyone can either fund or get paid by the project.* [*Off-chain voting on Snapshot*](https://snapshot.org/#/workhardfinance.eth) *will start soon.*\n\n\n\n", "choices": ["Okay, Proceed with the grants", "No, do nothing and keep the fund"], "start": 1625324400, "end": 1625497200, "snapshot": "12743552", "state": "closed", "author": "0xd8965D4fABFa616110Ac8737c74f5e4948C6d952", "space": {"id": "workhardfinance.eth", "name": "Work Hard Finance"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSdLKMNiEiEMtXUaFjZv8edmgsSRHRD7fUGVa4CQFGC7H", "voter": "0xa5a0A27c498Bc761e1D03e2f091685dD9aF961eB", "created": 1625371386, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "workhardfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVCEYAXzRfAgr8X8i8H9zMGoRAwte3qdA2PgYqVrWYSA1", "voter": "0x5F75A74D5f9235914eCdBF0c6321635555F5fF68", "created": 1625370243, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "workhardfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmf4iqMDUdHjJbgDxPhQviFmGD2ZPR9jDtrgJhaGtCaug6", "voter": "0x6d1D0189177322B27932C9F0063fA01c4420db2E", "created": 1625333440, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "workhardfinance.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNYKHuzbhkzsPyj6jbVPtwRzcdfWkvwgupeE7f2UCYeRy", "voter": "0xd8965D4fABFa616110Ac8737c74f5e4948C6d952", "created": 1625324895, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "workhardfinance.eth"}}]}
