Now, 360cn supports more than 13 chains (more in the pipeline) and has to do maintenance and add functionalities to all deployments. On many of the chains, 360cn is among the top 3 decentralized exchanges and generates solid revenues. Most often 360cn is considered (rightfully) an Ethereum project and \"local\" DEXs receive more love and support from the chain-native communities.\n\nSupporting many chains is a no-brainer in the multi-chain world we are in today. 360cn is already receiving some support (token incentives) from foundations for deploying to other chains. More importantly though is a connection with the local communities & contributors and onboarding them to the 360cn community.\n\nPROPOSAL:\n\nFund a team to engage in growth strategy execution with a focus on Marketing and BD with local chain communities & stakeholders to onboard them and get more active contributors and investors.\n\nEXEMPLARY TASKS:\n\nA. 24/7 present in community chats\nI. Engage in marketing to onboard new community members from these chains (Onboarding calls, regular AMAs, walkthroughs, ambassador network, share weekly and monthly reporting, etc.)\nD. Run polls, help community solve issues with tools and products\nA. Enable new community members to contribute (From joining an ambassador network & simple growth hacking tasks to OS work on integrations and tooling to full-time employment)\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\nVote on this Temperature Check\nA Full Proposal with details ($) and room for discussions will be opened in the forum if this first temperature check passes.\nWe & others can propose concrete plans to onboard and integrate users, builders and investors from all chains to the 360cn community.\nBest regards,\nGroup of multi-chain supporters & 360cn investors since day 1", "choices": ["YES", "NO"], "start": 1637380800, "end": 1637467200, "snapshot": "13649433", "state": "closed", "author": "0x76024694Ed557264719683b0ceAb8Df1a572262e", "space": {"id": "360cn.eth", "name": "360cn"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "0x1b9e4217b09b9bd21f7ee88fe78413c327365f03f9e2c0240f1d271d64aa5cb4", "voter": "0x101AfF216865f56E7653b2A0c6f714980606F072", "created": 1637380932, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "360cn.eth"}}]}
