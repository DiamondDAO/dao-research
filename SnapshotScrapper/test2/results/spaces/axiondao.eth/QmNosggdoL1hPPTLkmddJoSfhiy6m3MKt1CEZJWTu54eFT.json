Axion policy is to always perform audits on its code, but members of the community have requested to not delay the launch of v3 and that an audit is not necessary. The Axion Team has decided to put this decision up to a vote to allow the community to decide.\n\nWith such an important code upgrade on the line, there are several factors for our community to take into account regarding the audit, including timing, cost, and effectiveness of the audit. This vote is to determine firstly if an auction should be performed, and a follow-up vote will be held if a YES vote is approved to determine how to pay for it.\n\nFor more information, including the entire proposal and breakdown, visit the website:\nhttps://axion.network/news/dao-votes/should-axion-v3-be-audited", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1627149600, "end": 1627322400, "snapshot": "12890506", "state": "closed", "author": "0xDdB5ec9a30FfF8eCfe936f3752d5B9e0748e838F", "space": {"id": "axiondao.eth", "name": "Axion Foundation"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
