Even with Axion v3, a completely new code framework exclusive to Axion, there still isn't enough of a reduction in the amount of code to combat the rising price of Ethereum and the higher GWEI required to run transactions on the network. With ETH 2.0 still a complete unknown, we know that the longer we sit and wait for things to get better, the longer it will take to create a positive price movement and ROI for our community.\n\nAfter extensive research and testing, the team has chosen the Polygon chain ($MATIC) as the new home for the Axion Project. For more information about the Polygon chain movements, and the benefits of this migration, visit our website: \n\nhttps://axion.network/polygon\n\nImportant vote tallying information:\nThis vote will be held on a 1 vote-per-wallet count, regardless of the connected wallet's shares. This is to ensure the integrity of the vote with each member of the community. You can vote with multiple wallets, as long as your wallet has at least 1 stake of 350 days or longer.
