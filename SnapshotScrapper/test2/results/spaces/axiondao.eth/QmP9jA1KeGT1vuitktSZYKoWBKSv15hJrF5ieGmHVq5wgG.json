This vote presents four options: \n\nOption 1 \u2013 Cap Auction at 90% of Uniswap Price\nIn this scenario, a bid that would place the auction at a level higher than 90% of Uniswap price would not be allowed. Upon trying to bid, the bidder would be shown a message informing them that the value they are bidding is too high, and that they should either bid less or proceed to buy on Uniswap (would have a button for buying on Uniswap within our platform). \n\nOption 2 \u2013 Cap Auction at 95% of Uniswap Price\nIn this scenario, a bid that would place the auction at a level higher than 95% of Uniswap price would not be allowed. Upon trying to bid, the bidder would be shown a message informing them that the value they are bidding is too high, and that they should either bid less or proceed to buy on Uniswap (would have a button for buying on Uniswap within our platform).\n\nOption 3 \u2013 Cap Auction To Be The Same As Uniswap Price\nIn this scenario, a bid that would place the auction at a level higher than Uniswap price would not be allowed. Upon trying to bid, the bidder would receive a modal message informing them that the value they are bidding is too high, and that they should either bid less or proceed to buy on Uniswap (would have a button for buying on Uniswap within our platform).\n\t\nOption 4 \u2013 No Cap on Auction\nThis is currently how the auctions function. A vote in favor of this option would leave auctions as-is. \n\nNote:  For all options, in the event that an auction does not sell out, the maximum discount compared to Uniswap price would still be set at 10%.\n\nFor a detailed Cost/Benefit analysis, please visit https://www.punkynomics.com/blog/axion-dao-vote-capping-the-auctions", "choices": [" Cap Auction at 90% of Uniswap", "Cap Auction at 95% of Uniswap ", "Cap Auction at Equal to Uniswap", " No Cap on Auction"], "start": 1618619400, "end": 1618792200, "snapshot": "12254228", "state": "closed", "author": "0xDB8c6B6d4EB005ae22863519dB27f24B8775Ad1B", "space": {"id": "axiondao.eth", "name": "Axion Foundation"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
