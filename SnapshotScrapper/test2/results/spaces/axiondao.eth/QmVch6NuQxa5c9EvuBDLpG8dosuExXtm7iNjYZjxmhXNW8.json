Those users repeatedly self-referring into the auctions were abusing the referral system, making it less beneficial for community members to build useful fan sites and bring in new customers.  The referral system also results in several small 14 day stakes, which can be counterproductive due to fees.  \n\nWith this vote, we will abolish the referral system as it stands and replace it with an \u2018Axion Verified Partner\u2019 network.  This network would continue to provide a benefit to partners who are bringing in new customers, but no longer provide a benefit for the bidders, eliminating self-referrals. If approved, the Axion Core team will initiate another vote laying out the Verified Partner Network requirements and mechanisms. Removing the referral system will also make it slightly cheaper to bid in the regular auctions, and create the stake the following day. \n\n\n\n### Currently, bidders into each auction receive the following benefits: \n\n| Option | Description |\n| ------ | ----------- |\n| VCA:| 10% back in wBTC, and a 90% cap (20% Total benefit) \n||120 day minimum stake duration |\n| Regular | 90% cap on auction level (10% Total benefit)|\n| | 60 day minimum stake duration|\n|w/Referral:|10% Additional Benefit  (20% Total benefit)|\n|w/Self-Referral:| 20% Additional Benefit (30% Total benefit)|\n|| 14-day auto stake|\n\n\n### Options for this vote: \n\nThis is a vote to balance the economic benefit of both the Regular Auctions and the VCA.\n\nPlease click the image to enlarge it to read each option:\n[![Foo](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/343410121/56771d852cca002ae27cde41/Balancing-Axion-Auctions.png)](https://support.axion.network/en/articles/5283048-balancing-axion-auctions)\n", "choices": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"], "start": 1622286000, "end": 1622563200, "snapshot": "12530159", "state": "closed", "author": "0xDdB5ec9a30FfF8eCfe936f3752d5B9e0748e838F", "space": {"id": "axiondao.eth", "name": "Axion Foundation"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
