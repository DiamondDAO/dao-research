Initiate a Proposal 2. Proposal publicity and optimization 3. Proposal voting 4. Proposal execution and supervision\n\n\nInitiate a Proposal \n\n-- discover the optimizable points and problems of Golff, and find a solution to promote the better development of the project\n\n-- In the process of participating in community discussions, community members discover the points that Golff could be optimized, explor for solutions, and initially form proposals. The early stage of the proposal can be fully discussed in the community to facilitate the complete presentation of the proposal.\n\n\n\nProposal publicity and optimization\n\n-- The proposal initially formed by the community often has shortcomings. During the publicity period, GOF token holders in the community can participate in the discussion, thereby optimizing the content of the proposal.\n\n--After the community has fully discussed the proposal, the proposal can be publicized in the Golf Vote section. The publicity time is 48 hours. During the publicity period, community users can continue to leave messages to make optimization suggestions and initiate reasonable discussions. \n\nIf there is something wrong with the proposal, the proposal initiator can delete the original proposal and re-initiate the proposal for corresponding publicity. The proposal was officially approved after 48 hours of publicity and support from more than 10 people. During the publicity period, if the proposal is found to be politically sensitive or insulting vocabulary, the core team of Golff have the right to stop publicizing the proposal in the Vote section.\n\n\nProposal Voting\n\n--publicly approved proposal will be widely voted in the community, so that the finally approved proposal can represent the ideas of most GOF holders.\n\n\n-- For the approved proposal, the core developer initiates a proposal voting on the snapshot, and the main content of the proposal must be consistent with the published content.\n\nFor proposals that pass the public announcement, the core developers will synchronize the snapshot voting page of the proposal with the Vote section of the Golff product website to increase the exposure and participation of the proposal.\n-- A proposal must pass the referendum to meet the following conditions: a. The proposal has gone through a 48-hour publicity process b. The voting time is no less than 24 hours c. More than 300,000 GOFs participated in the voting d. The result is passed or agreed\n\n\nProposal execution and supervision\n-- The proposal passed by the community must be implemented by the official team and the volunteer team, and be supervised by the community\n\n-- The proposal passed by the vote must be claimed by the group involved (development, strategy, product, community operation, content output) within 24 hours and start to arrange the implementation. The specific implementation process will be through the Golff weekly project The weekly progress report is synchronized with the community.\n
