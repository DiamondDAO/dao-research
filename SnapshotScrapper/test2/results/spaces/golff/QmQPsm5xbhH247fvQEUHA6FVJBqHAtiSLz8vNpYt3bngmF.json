Rules and regulations for community governance are needed to", "body": "The current Golff community governance does not have any regulation and threshold. It is unreasonable for a proposal to pass with very small amount of GOF. For example, the proposal initiated to reduce 30% of all other pools, and doubled GOF pool in 4th round of liquidity mining. That does not represent for Golff community at all. Rules and regulations for community governance are needed to be published from Golff official team, and passed by community as soon as possible", "choices": ["Agree", "Disagree"], "start": 1602640800, "end": 1602727200, "snapshot": "11032545", "state": "closed", "author": "0x1CB672bD49EB10A95A62B424CfB136AB3DF0B32C", "space": {"id": "golff", "name": "Golff Finance"}, "votes": 5, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdqdpLJhcVgUfY51RbyKV9rYQoFfGyhEmM1dYDoaxufL7", "voter": "0x325740EadDcE59A1f1B67BDcb65D70EC2d34dF16", "created": 1602654924, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "golff"}}, {"id": "QmXBTBvPk99GcK5sXFWiY4e7HTybvkFdbLjf9YLW6TMsZu", "voter": "0x1CB672bD49EB10A95A62B424CfB136AB3DF0B32C", "created": 1602653356, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "golff"}}, {"id": "QmPE2AntmHqXP8tfiL5PtJRAzGaGN21XPaU5Q3aUS5v8eN", "voter": "0x6cE3A029E2aC6b2Ce8DF84f91F9c0A562C2614F6", "created": 1602651088, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "golff"}}, {"id": "QmYcvJ1bZNEJqtzoEqtjxjmywXrEFMqLAomiQ9ask7oBeY", "voter": "0x3409fa7DE1aa34db476808eCa6bB0E8eF7915EAE", "created": 1602650921, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "golff"}}, {"id": "QmPgc5kWpe3GT2c1QFsvRecr3iuUMKfcvWo21oHhY831oC", "voter": "0xf75220097653E4335b0227b51f8CFb0F7528F864", "created": 1602650387, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "golff"}}]}
