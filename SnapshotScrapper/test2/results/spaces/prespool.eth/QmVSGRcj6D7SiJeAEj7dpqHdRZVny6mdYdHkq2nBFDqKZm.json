Moving the funds on Aragon requires expensive on-chain voting, which contributes to a low turnout on Aragon voting. The new version of Aragon offers off-chain voting, but it is still unproven and not fully available on an Ethereum testnet. It\u2019s also unclear whether disputes on voting will require to use Aragon Court, another unproven system with its own tokenomics.\n\nSnapshot is already used by Spool DAO. It is the most popular voting solution for DAOs at the moment, thanks to its simplicity, its extensibility, and the fact that it costs nothing to voters. However, decisions taken with Snapshot cannot be directly enforced, since the vote is off-chain. It requires a third party to execute on-chain operations approved by token holders, such as deploying a new contract or allocating funds from the DAO treasury. This third party is generally a multisig, with signers that can be elected by token holders - but again, this decision cannot be directly enforced by the voters.\n\nUsing a Snapshot + a multisig setup would be a move backwards on the decentralization path. Spool resources are already under the direct control of Spool DAO members via its token. Using independent signers is problematic since it breaks the trustless flow between decision and execution. However, it is possible to extend Snapshot so that decisions made by token holders are actually enacted on-chain, using Gnosis Safesnap\u2019s plugin for Snapshot, which bridges Snapshot to a Gnosis Safe multisig, and the Reality module, that enables to challenge a decision via a bond of governance tokens (in our case, SPOOL). The (Gnosis Safe) multisig signers can be disabled so that only decisions made via Snapshot will be executed by the Safe.\n\nI\u2019m suggesting three options as a replacement of Aragon: \n\n**1. Snapshot + Gnosis Safe + Reality Module**, with multisig owners elected by token holders via Snapshot, as a temporary measure for a few months (in order to have a mean of last resort in case something goes wrong), and then move to option #3 (upon voting). In this setting, SPOOL holders make decisions and trust that the multisig signers will execute them and won\u2019t use the funds in other ways.\n\n**2. Snapshot + Gnosis Safe + Reality Module + Scope Guard**, where the multisig owners (elected by token holders via Snapshot) are limited to calling the veto function on the Reality module (a safeguard against malicious transactions, as a mean of last resort in case something goes wrong), and then move to option #3 (upon voting). In this setting, multisig signers can only veto decisions made by token holders, they can\u2019t move the funds by themselves.\n\n**3. Snapshot + Safesnap + Reality, without multisig signers** (full decentralization). There\u2019s no more multisig signers, token holders\u2019 votes are automatically enacted. There\u2019s still a grace period during which token holders can challenge the vote, but the majority has the final word.\n\nThere\u2019s a 4th option: **DAO treasury remains on Aragon**, token holders pay for voting and their decisions are automatically executed - for the record, my last vote on Aragon costed me more than $40\u2026", "choices": ["Snapshot vote, signers execute", "Snapshot vote, signers veto", "Snapshot vote + auto-execution", "Aragon vote + execution"], "start": 1632304800, "end": 1632690000, "snapshot": "13277314", "state": "closed", "author": "0x683F0cbEb9CFef9F2D53fC559093b659B2257815", "space": {"id": "prespool.eth", "name": "PreSpool"}, "votes": 9, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdDDcofA1tkNiWDL13e8TMBnBYfcKwiBdGfcP7FENXjkm", "voter": "0x2e973FbecCBcb4D705aAdA9EA783CFe8FdF275AB", "created": 1632534875, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "prespool.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTDnbAELDsfJaha8f2qUN2BLRcg1pb9igE4ZMLZUd4XFi", "voter": "0x4dA261C0689aDd1eA63BdD9a0970626ecD10A6dD", "created": 1632484229, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "prespool.eth"}}, {"id": "QmWBApqW7XCGNzJ4QorhtxsRMxSEonzyAyNsasd6ndvwGs", "voter": "0xEb73058499eD6ec323c4da4Ac6769844C30bd9A8", "created": 1632476763, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "prespool.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUbXMTdHi1fp4bwP38vaJm2buc5F3hp1Z68ESbt85Gt5e", "voter": "0xd8879be0032092eb5E610d5a2aB64E56Ae010348", "created": 1632474588, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "prespool.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYX5PPM3tqoBkanCZn5RG24db56kEu2DGgJfrqafFZdJx", "voter": "0x683F0cbEb9CFef9F2D53fC559093b659B2257815", "created": 1632471504, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "prespool.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUJ5PWx3GTAsRDjE9TkSK4CQtmkj9sAWJx2EG8QcjEMGW", "voter": "0x1D34178a39fe9070924B1F2Ab31a064F972Ea4d8", "created": 1632426143, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "prespool.eth"}}, {"id": "QmdUZ9eYggvusoNMTCYRtQgp5qLyGAuTbSRoVy3HNHVwqe", "voter": "0x1F2D4431a415d3065A95810449F21c8e391065EE", "created": 1632413118, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "prespool.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNVGUo7SBekbbFm3EqrWNFEkcRd7hzUps3BwvoBUrt26N", "voter": "0xC226De7F0e4a11198560a0038F76C2C5C3c8597a", "created": 1632384068, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "prespool.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQJLEuPKhTJSNCSu5pX3NxtEayGF1hDGXyH4EnXRLYu1X", "voter": "0x87b4A9e3579B7808a1338d975C5bdE802D36dCB4", "created": 1632343466, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "prespool.eth"}}]}
