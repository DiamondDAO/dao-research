Now, some community members believe that the update frequency of HTMoon_Finance\u2019s Twitter account is too low, so CORE will initiate the first step of HTMOON\u2019s autonomy. If the proposal is approved, HTMoon_Finance's Twitter account will be transferred to the community manager. If the proposal is not approved, CORE will still own Twitter\nThe https://htmoon.finance/#/swap update license will be temporarily transferred to CORE.
