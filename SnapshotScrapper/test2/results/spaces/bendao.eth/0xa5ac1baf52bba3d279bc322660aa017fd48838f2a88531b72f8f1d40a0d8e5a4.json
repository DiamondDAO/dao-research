Since its inception, BENMO has grown to have a market capitalization of $35,874.45 (at time of writing) with an unactualized streaming fee of $197.03 (streaming fee: 0.95%). \n\nWith scalability in mind, executing index management activities on Ethereum mainnet (e.g. rebalancing, asset addition/deduction, streaming fee adjustment(s), etc.) are unfavorably exorbitant. These high gas costs act as impediments and significantly restrict our abilities to make essential modifications that would improve the overall performance & quality of BENMO. \n\nWe propose to migrate BENMO over to Polygon in an attempt to mitigate lofty gas fees while unlocking necessary index management activities \n\n**Abstract**\n\nIn order to initiate this migration, we will have to deploy a new BENMO contract on Polygon with initial allocations matching the most recent allocations on the Ethereum version of BENMO, adjusting for supported tokens and liquidity on Polygon. The long-term benefits/costs associated with the redeployment far outweigh the costs in maintaining the Ethereum mainnet index product. In effect, once BENMO has launched on Polygon, our BENMO managers will be able to execute rebalancing events on a more frequent basis - at negligible cost. \n\n**Specification** \n\nOverview: \nThe proposed migration will serve as a precedent setting effort towards utilizing Layer-2 protocols/interfaces while empowering our student-members with the first-hand experience needed to familiarize themselves with such ecosystems and management activities. \n\nIt will also act as an innovative way to continue growing our BEN Traders initiative by working with students to create rebalancing reports and analyses. This way, students may gain hands-on experience in managing funds and build a portfolio that they may showcase when seeking out future internship or employment opportunities.\n\n**Technical Specification**\n1.  Define the initial allocations and deploy the new BENMO index on Polygon \n2.
