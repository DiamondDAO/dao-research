Most recently, we had a very successful experience with our students at Cosmos Cosmoverse, Solana Breakpoint Lisbon, and DeFi Live in London.\n\nAs we prepare the photos, videos, and podcasts from those events for publishing, DCentral Miami is fast approaching. BEN has brought dozens of students to Miami over the years for The North American Bitcoin Conferences and Bitcoin 2021. We are excited to see a metaverse & NFT focused conference happening in Miami. We have several students that we met at NFT.NYC that would like to attend DCentral and we also want to outreach through our network and find more students to bring. While there, we believe that we can connect these students with opportunities to get more involved in the space, as well as to create more educational content for our online resources.\n\n**Costs**\nIn order to enable students with this opportunity, there is a cost associated and we propose voting in the following proposal for a BEN trip from Nov 30th to Dec 1st in Miami:\nAirbnb Costs: $1000\nFlights: $600\nTransportation: $220\nMiscellaneous (ubers, buses, visas etc): $180\nTotal: $2000\n\nIf approved, 50,000 BENcoin will be withdrawn from the BEN DAO multi-sig wallet. The 50,000 BENcoin will be rewarded to community members who are willing to sponsor the funds for the students to attend these events.\n\n**Deliverables & Expectations**\n1- Creation of at least 5 new BEN podcast episodes with well-known individuals through the BEN Media Initiative.\n2- Film and deliver a recap video to the community detailing how attending these conferences impacted the life of at least one student.\n3- Photos and videos of the students attending the events.\n\n**Comments & Feedback**\nHere are a few statements of intent from two students that expressed a lot of interest in attending:\n\n------------------------------------\nPurdue Entrepreneurship has enabled me to discover and pursue interests. By having the\nopportunity to represent Purdue at DCentral Miami event, a leading annual Non\u2011Fungible Token Event, I\u2019ll be able to learn and network with industry professionals. This will greatly benefit me as I bring key insights back to the Purdue entrepreneurship community since there is a strong interest in Blockchain. With COVID under control, I am grateful by having the ability to attend networking events and major conferences.\n\nAt the moment, I am working on expanding the Blockchain organization that just started at Purdue and building things in web3 myself. I believe that attending this conference allows me to learn about the latest trends and innovations that will make a large impact on the development of our Blockchain club. As a leader of our organization, BEN\u2019s support will greatly benefit me to pursue my personal goals and potentially change my life.\n\nFinally, I have never been to Miami and meeting with other students from BEN will enable me to connect and forge relationships with other like-minded individuals whole accelerating my career.\n\nIn short, I look forward to leveraging this unique opportunity to expand my horizons. Having the ability to network with incredible people in the same space will enable me to hear more about the web3/defi community.\n\nKevin - Purdue University\n\n------------------------------------\n\nWith the opportunity to attend the DCentral Miami event, one of the leading NFT conferences, I\u2019ll be able to learn from and network with leaders in web3. It will be beneficial for both me personally and for our entrepreneurship club here at Purdue to connect our community with this promising and rapidly developing ecosystem.\n\nAt the moment, I am working 1) rebuilding Purdue\u2019s builder community after things went remote over Covid. We have amazing talent here and bringing our community together has helped push so many students over the edge in terms of starting projects and learning about new topics (web3 is the most popular). 2) Pursuing my own projects. The main one is a collaborative email client designed to streamline complex, multiparty workflows I have been building with a friend from high school. I\u2019ve also joined DeveloperDao and started building a DAO to invest in Purdue students building web3 startups.\n\nBEN\u2019s support and meeting other students from BEN will enable me to build relationships with like minded people and find truly revolutionary projects to join in and help build. I look forward to using this opportunity to expand my perspective, learn more about what is being built in this incredible ecosystem, and forge connections to help our web3 community here at Purdue.\n\nTimmy - Purdue University\n", "choices": ["Approve", "Decline"], "start": 1637071200, "end": 1637168400, "snapshot": "19094543", "state": "closed", "author": "0x66Aa8Bee5366b6b48811AE0Dac9Fe5e1EEfE1621", "space": {"id": "bendao.eth", "name": "Blockchain Education Network"}, "votes": 2, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xe6a7ef001a2cfcb9d157169a10c620a83a1186de9853b79a37c977b5aa4bb10f", "voter": "0xb215cFebB90D91b1D2F499843800d3105b1366Fc", "created": 1637167597, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bendao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x87eb047b1b4a1770c10e45af3e02060846eeae56f52da0f04ab1a9a37b0e11b1", "voter": "0x9FfD0a5b5438B95861167422E745D34d151bcc3b", "created": 1637081264, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bendao.eth"}}]}
