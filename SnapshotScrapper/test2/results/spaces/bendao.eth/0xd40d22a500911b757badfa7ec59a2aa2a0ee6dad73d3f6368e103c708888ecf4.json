The year 2021 affected our mission due to the restrictions imposed from Covid-19; many conferences, hackathons, and other opportunities for students disappeared, and the world went to full lockdown mode.\n\nAs life returns to normal, new opportunities arise, and the Lisbon Blockchain Week serves as a great example. Students finally have the chance to network in person again and find a job in the industry. We have successfully partnered with Near, Cosmos, and Solana to provide free student tickets to over ten students from around the world ( from Texas to Turkmenistan) who are willing to fly to Lisbon to attend these conferences and seek new opportunities to build their careers. \n\n**Costs** \nIn order to enable students with these unique opportunities, there is a cost associated and we propose voting in the following proposal for a BEN trip from the 7th to the 10th of Nov in Lisbon:\n\nAirbnb Costs: $1000\nFlights: $600\nVisas: $150\nTransportation: $70\nMiscellaneous (ubers, buses, etc): $180\nTotal: $2000\n\nIf approved, 40,000 BENcoin will be withdrawn from the BEN DAO multi-sig wallet. The 40,000 BENcoin will be rewarded to community members who are willing to sponsor the funds for the students to attend these events.\n\n**Deliverables & Expectations**\n1- Creation of at least 5 new BEN podcast episodes with notorious individuals from the Cosmos and Solana communities through the BEN Media Initiative.\n\n2- Film and deliver a recap video to the community detailing how attending these conferences impacted the life of at least one student.\n\n3- Photos and videos of the students attending the events.\n\n**Comments & Feedback**\nHere are a few statements of intent from two students that expressed a lot of interest in attending: \n\n\n\nSince my childhood, entrepreneurship has been a dream for me. As a Turkish citizen, I realized that to achieve and build the business of my dreams, I need to seek new opportunities outside of my home country, just like when Eren Bali left Turkey for San Francisco and founded Udemy. \n\n\n*At the moment, I am working on funding my start-up about trustless ETH staking. Executing large transactions are possible on Ethereum with small fees. However, the opposite is impossible, and the two alternatives of such applications are Cosmos and Solana. I believe that attending these two conferences,  getting to learn more about these two protocols will make a large impact on the development of my start-up.*\n\n*Lastly, I've never been outside of Turkey, and meeting with other students from BEN is something that I feel safe and that I believe can change my career.*\n\n*To sum up, I desire and strive to for this unique opportunity to get and new vision.  Having the opportunity to put me out there and network with other founders would change my life.* \n\n**Thomas Steadman- Student from Turkey under a pseudonym due to privacy concerns.**\n\n\n*I'm currently invested while also learning development for Solana. This would be a massive opportunity for me if we could work out a way for me to get a ticket on a discount. Just can't afford the ticket price at that level being a college student with loans.*\n\n**Alan- Bentley University**\n\n", "choices": ["Approve", "Reject"], "start": 1635879600, "end": 1636052400, "snapshot": "18869592", "state": "closed", "author": "0x66Aa8Bee5366b6b48811AE0Dac9Fe5e1EEfE1621", "space": {"id": "bendao.eth", "name": "Blockchain Education Network"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "0xa6bf6dde288359876447c2f9897e6d7e0e471f885a13eb1bd50d5f98ade3fde0", "voter": "0xb215cFebB90D91b1D2F499843800d3105b1366Fc", "created": 1635971844, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bendao.eth"}}, {"id": "0x9d2c50c58213fa4543ed60b5ba1ef30e629b0661c9146b21b1f2537391e08729", "voter": "0x14D92832265eeAFDEF9e526356FEfc90105966c3", "created": 1635880971, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bendao.eth"}}, {"id": "0xe488207b9ecec542d0abdff44136ab574067894df9b5f639f688282e9e0ce1ea", "voter": "0x71B16be056Aa3129726dfEBc050669F75be0255A", "created": 1635880808, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bendao.eth"}}]}
