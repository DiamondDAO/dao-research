SCP02 aims to outline a path to onboard new Core Contributors and to compensate community + collaborator commitment to the DAO via Working Groups & part-time work.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe proposal is designed to create additional leverage for the Core Contributor team by onboarding a Producer whose role is primarily dedicated to the DAO\u2019s Studio offering. The compensation package for the Producer is reflective of what other Core Contributors would receive if they were offered a position on the DAO Core team.\n\nAdditionally, the DAO has identified several opportunities for part-time work within the DAO. Compensating Working Group participants and part-time community members empowers the DAO to lean on domain expertise of its Collaborator network while also engaging talented members of the community. Including members of Seed Club outside of the Core Contributor team will afford the DAO to accomplish its ambitious goals at an accelerated rate.\n\nSpecification\n\nProducer\nCompensation:\n- USDC: 8,000 per month\n- CLUB: 2,000 per month\n- $CLUB compensation will not be subject to a cliff. USDC and $CLUB compensation is subject to change at the voting discretion of the DAO\nCompensation will commence upon approval of the proposal thereafter following a monthly cadence\n\n\nContributors & Collaborators\n\nContributor and Collaborator participation should be considered part-time, ad-hoc, and on an as needed basis. Work from these two stakeholders is immensely additive to the DAO and should be recognized through compensation.\n\nThere are two structures by which Contributors and Collaborators can be compensated for their efforts: part-time effort and working group participation.\n\nPart-time Contributors\n\nThese are community members who have been identified as highly skilled and capable members of the DAO. \nThese Contributors often have other jobs/obligations but are committed to providing 10-20 hours a week to Seed Club.\nOn a monthly basis, part-time contributors will be budgeted the following\n- 2,500 USDC\n\nAt the end of each month part-time contributors can choose from two options for compensation. The amount of CLUB disbursed would be determined at noon PST on the last day of the month in advance of treasury distributions.\n- 100% USDC & 0% CLUB\n- 50% USDC & 50% CLUB\n- For example, CLUB price on Oct 31st = $25 USD then the following would be sent to part-time contributor: 1,250 USDC & 50 CLUB\n\nAfter three months of working at the current compensation structure, part-time contributors are eligible to receive a budgeted contribution of 4,000 USDC/mo. The same distribution terms apply. Various contributors have been identified to commence part-time work for the DAO and their work will commence when the Core team identifies a need.\n\nCollaborators\n\nCollaborator recognition through compensation will be reviewed on a monthly basis. Token allocation in the form of CLUB or USDC for working group participation or project advisory is subject to the review of the Core team. Distributions will be made monthly.\n\n\nImportant Notes\n\n- Compensation will be revisited for all stakeholders once CLUB token is launched. A future proposal will detail terms of compensation, vesting schedule, cliffs, etc once CLUB is publicly available.\n- A forecasted monthly budget and actuals is under development as more stakeholders are earning compensation.\n- The compensation framework above is enacted going forward for all new core contributors and part-time contributors until a future proposal is enacted. This grants the Core team flexibility to hire and compensate DAO contributors at the above compensation package until a new proposal is passed.\n\nVote\n\nYes - Accept compensation framework for DAO Contributors\nNo - Reject compensation framework for DAO Contributors\n\n", "choices": ["Accept compensation framework", "Reject compensation framework"], "start": 1632936600, "end": 1633114800, "snapshot": "13317990", "state": "closed", "author": "0x79cFb3df47dDd3E9261f7ba06FD0C8dAadB05f2E", "space": {"id": "club.eth", "name": "Seed Club"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "Qme85Frt5UATLw9StZyMjZ7qp9vstPQfudpje72vJBT6Ev", "voter": "0xc69549d1e95B6b9721e07A848a30efBE4b7eE359", "created": 1633032727, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "club.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVBehkd8nAUicU3J4Cj8fhyHqVXoJPaTbE2mDbvMkK4fy", "voter": "0x135C21b2DA426760718E39DA954974c4572AE9f6", "created": 1633003472, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "club.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeKzmdqK7aBsjyqz8Lc651csTUqUP4mhPpaf8NzBtzYUA", "voter": "0x79cFb3df47dDd3E9261f7ba06FD0C8dAadB05f2E", "created": 1632936831, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "club.eth"}}]}
