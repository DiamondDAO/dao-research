However, the pool has relatively low liquidity and trade volume. Currently, it is incentivized with 80,000 DFD/week which seems like an overkill for a pool that has about $3million in liquidity. We offer 2 alternatives, either allocate this amount to upcoming ibBTC vaults or refrain from spending it for now; effectively reducing the emissions.", "choices": ["Continue the DUSD/ETH pool", "Reallocate to ibBTC", "Discontinue and reduce emission"], "start": 1619884800, "end": 1620057600, "snapshot": "12349283", "state": "closed", "author": "0x08F7506E0381f387e901c9D0552cf4052A0740a4", "space": {"id": "defidolla.eth", "name": "DefiDollar DAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
