These pools would let the price oracles for these platforms measure bBadger and bDigg, a necessary step for Unit Protocol integration.\n\nSee Discussions: https://forum.badger.finance/t/bip-39-bbadger-eth-bdigg-eth-sushi-pool-proposal/3493", "choices": ["For", "Against", "Abstain"], "start": 1614628800, "end": 1614801600, "snapshot": "11954170", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa001B5639e4ed26dF58367016eB08850e3e55655", "space": {"id": "badgerdao.eth", "name": "BadgerDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
