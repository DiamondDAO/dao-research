With the initial BADGER airdrop unclaimed BADGER was clawed back starting after 48 hours 20% at a time so after 7 days all unclaimed BADGER moved to community control. No scaling; after 7 days after official DIGG launch, all unclaimed DIGG will be clawed back and be under community control. Any uses for this unclaimed DIGG can be proposed in future BIPs.\n\nDiscussions: https://forum.badger.finance/t/bip-27-digg-clawback/2181", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1611518400, "end": 1611691200, "snapshot": "11721427", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa001B5639e4ed26dF58367016eB08850e3e55655", "space": {"id": "badgerdao.eth", "name": "BadgerDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
