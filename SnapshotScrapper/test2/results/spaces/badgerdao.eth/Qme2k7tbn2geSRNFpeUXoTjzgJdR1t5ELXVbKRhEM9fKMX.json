{"id": "Qme2k7tbn2geSRNFpeUXoTjzgJdR1t5ELXVbKRhEM9fKMX", "title": "BIP 35: Long-Term Core-Contributors", "body": "TLDR; Propose framework for long-term core-contributor compensation for Badger Builders to establish a clear incentive structure for full and part-time core contributors to the DAO. This BIP also proposes the initial group of long-term core-contributors. Compensation is between $100k - $300k based on experience and contribution levels.  This will be distributed 50/50 between USDC and Badger, vested over 1 year and distributed to employees daily through the badger tree.  The price of Badger distributed is based on when the core team member started contributing to the project in a meaningful way, as has been proven to be an effective compensation model by top tier technology companies that retain outstanding talent.\n\nFor details of framework and additional discussions, see here: https://forum.badger.finance/t/bip-35-long-term-core-contributors/3006", "choices": ["For", "Against"], "start": 1612900800, "end": 1613073600, "snapshot": "11817226", "state": "closed", "author": "0xa001B5639e4ed26dF58367016eB08850e3e55655", "space": {"id": "badgerdao.eth", "name": "BadgerDAO"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
