We would now like to extend the program through the year (ending DEC 31 2021), incorporating a re-configured team built entirely from community elections.\nAGC Recap\n[The AGC safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xeABCcd75dA6c021c7553dB4A74CACC958812432A/balances)  currently holds 50,757.002 AUDIO.\nThe pilot program granted 41,824 Audio to unique artists & initiatives over its 3 months of operations.\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n[IRL art x MOCA show](https://www.irlunderground.com/)  - Crypto native event promoting the intersection of music and web3, including live performance, NFTs and Audius education.\n(https://www.irlunderground.com/) - 2500 $AUDIO\n\nSenjienZ - [Audius party bot](https://twitter.com/SenjienZ/status/1421111777551548417?s=20) development in the Audius Discord.

This amounted to a total of 3750 $AUDIO distributed per month, and would total to 11,250 $AUDIO over the extension should it be approved in the same manner.\n\n\n\n**Addendum of Members**\nStarting this next term, we will be transitioning to an application process, where all committee members who wish to serve for the proposed extension will need to complete a form and be judged by the community, including those involved with the three-month pilot. Our goal is to have a newly elected committee prepared to begin operations by the end of this month. Our flow for achieving this would be as follows:\n\nPhase 1: Initial proposal is released, decision regarding whether or not the AUDIO Grants Committee continues under the terms of this proposal is made by the community via Snapshot within one week of this being posted on the governance forum.\n\nPhase 2: Should this proposal be accepted, we will release a form where community members can apply to serve on the AUDIO Grants Committee for the proposed period of time. All non-personal information contained in each application will be shared with the public, and every community member will be eligible to apply. The deadline for applications should be within the third full week of September (19th - 25th). \n\nPhase 3: All applications will be shared with the community on the governance forum for discussion, and community voting will initiate for the proposed roles of the new committee. For each election, the community will vote between each applicant as well as a \u201cno confidence\u201d vote; should the latter be the majority pick, a new set of applicants will be asked to apply for the position in question and a second vote would take place. Unless a \u201cno confidence\u201d majority is reached for a proposed position, voting would end and the lineup of the newly elected committee would be announced during the last week of September (26th - 2nd).\n\nRegardless of whether they are voted to continue through the extension, current committee members will be obligated to aid the newly-voted panel through their first two weeks of operations. This process of \u201chanding over the torch\u201d will not entail any $AUDIO payment.\n\n**Motivation**\nThe pilot program has proven to us, as well as to all of our grant recipients, that $AUDIO can be an unprecedented driving force in propelling artist communities and initiatives forward. As Audius continues to inspire and empower artists around the world, we believe the AUDIO Grants Committee is a perfect avenue for augmenting creators\u2019 endeavors and rewarding their fans.  \n\n**Specification**\nGrant the right to distribute the remaining ~50k AUDIO tokens in the [committee multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xeABCcd75dA6c021c7553dB4A74CACC958812432A/balances) found at 0xeABCcd75dA6c021c7553dB4A74CACC958812432A.\nThe committee is responsible for overseeing the distribution of monthly rewards to members and the ongoing allocation of AUDIO to grant recipients.\nAny unused AUDIO that remains at the end of the extension should be returned to the community treasury, but only if the program is not extended after the next 3 month period.\n\n*proposal reduced for snapshot txt limits.\n\n**Voting:**\nIf voted yes, the program will move into community elections to bring in new members for the next term (until Dec 31 2021). Members of the committee\u2019s pilot program will need to reapply and be considered alongside the community.\n\nIf voted no, the committee will cease to exist in its entirety.\nYes - Continue the AGC program.\nNo - Do not continue the AGC program.\n", "choices": ["Yes - Continue", "No - Do not continue"], "start": 1631577600, "end": 1632034740, "snapshot": "13219787", "state": "closed", "author": "0xD3C1B9a1959B8BE13252546871d37D83100cAf8D", "space": {"id": "audiogrants.eth", "name": "Audio Grants Committee"}, "votes": 6, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmQKD4W9Qj2yLRcoG6ALPF3hkCH5avzQGfWtE9y9VSUAR7", "voter": "0x3cE5dDCD669360f259088d22667acB9C718A9458", "created": 1631795678, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "audiogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmPPw5k4mPcbzgiGAa9FfWidLyyq9So2GZwPMTY7jLPE3E", "voter": "0x94C2574dd3b83E075F6E9F8A410113A397d6Ddf3", "created": 1631793651, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "audiogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaHUQCsUzC5ymfcGqaxH6tvPAUpoux6aR7xN2MFvEZpmU", "voter": "0x4603913EaF35B4F15673ED446D06220B117d2D15", "created": 1631765670, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "audiogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmSDrDoAVyugS2SqrQBkqyK7HBBZxWsB6Sw8us6uJu1NnR", "voter": "0xD01D744Ae46b1B80ed908479B8e704Ebd8a53ad7", "created": 1631742620, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "audiogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRXSkR4J5zqVbdKoHJqAyjcdKQggC4y4ij7JBuvJG3Y4z", "voter": "0xa4A4Efe54D20887eC260a6e1C33082cC06435a42", "created": 1631739626, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "audiogrants.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTER4fz3vJWYH9x6USaYYTAREYbEAausAxxcaJbbbQF88", "voter": "0xe200FE1Caa09ec38F5dc3C8B7b298a2e99e9268d", "created": 1631732569, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "audiogrants.eth"}}]}
