Tidal users would provide decentralized insurance to bZx assets.\n\nDetails:\n\nbZx Protocol will be purchasing $1 million USD-worth coverage through Tidal Finance to cover their protocol\u2019s safety. In case of a payout event, the coverage amount will be directly paid to the bZx team to facilitate a speed recovery of their users fund.\n\nThe insurance policy would cover any losses arising out of bZx smart contract vulnerabilities that are deployed on the Ethereum network. Malicious attacks and economic exploits resulting in bZx users\u2019 asset loss would qualify for a valid claim. Any valid payout amount will be directly paid to the bZx team to recover bZx users\u2019 loss. For more general coverage policy wording, please refer to Tidal\u2019s gitbook cover policy 1 section.\n\nThe $10k USDC in this proposal would pay the weekly premiums on $1m worth of insurance from Tidal for their mutual cover pools. This would pay the insurance premiums on Tidal for a period of 6 months at a cost of roughly $384 every week.", "choices": ["Agree", "Disagree"], "start": 1628857800, "end": 1629117000, "snapshot": "13016893", "state": "closed", "author": "0xB7F72028D9b502Dc871C444363a7aC5A52546608", "space": {"id": "bzx.eth", "name": "bZx"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmZDYWsF5bdW4PztcTxHUzutMjBdrCvNDWUUTmPPaU3HE6", "voter": "0x9030B78A312147DbA34359d1A8819336fD054230", "created": 1628886741, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bzx.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU6bpWSous5WEg15GzUHtX1c2mUTsjaFzPkDER1qBw2j4", "voter": "0x69Ee6b571fb1cfD0fF441F3761e8a4b201e04D4C", "created": 1628870262, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bzx.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbTX9WTj1Vf7yAcWxwpkHNnusdgzSjfyDFurkRGchVMRG", "voter": "0xE487A866b0f6b1B663b4566Ff7e998Af6116fbA9", "created": 1628867720, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "bzx.eth"}}]}
