When a user withdraws the COFI of the market maker pool, at this time the system will calculate the number of blocks between the height of the last transferred block and the height of the current block, and generate the corresponding COFI to be transferred to the market maker pool.\nThis will cause, the COFI balance of the market maker pool, to be inconsistent with the COFI that should actually be issued to the user, as there is a portion of the COFI, which has actually been generated as the block height passes, but has not been generated and transferred from the 0x00000000 address as no user has done the fetch operation.\nSo, when the V1 version was closed, some market makers, especially for ETH/HBTC, had a situation where the COFI that should be retrieved disappeared, and after checking the data on the chain, the user losses were as follows.\nUSDT/ETH, last out of mining blocks: 12450774\nHBTC/ETH, last mined block: 12380120\nInterval blocks: 70654. 0.297 per block mined, number of blocks not released: 20,984.238 cofi\n\nThat is, there are 20,984 COFIs that have actually been generated, and due to the design of the contract, these 20,984 COFIs have not been generated and transferred to the mining pool.\n\ntelegram has already had feedback from users on this situation and after community discussion we have decided to compensate those who have lost out:.\n0x8bc0fc5b31fa30266a3dd81753be66ee4b62a7f9 ----2802.83cofi\n0x5fa1dd7f6dce7066d8be8b8787575d66a20dc44c --- 17277.79cofi\nOther --- 903.60cofi\n\nCOFI for compensation, sourced from DAO funds.\n\nVote now on whether you agree to transfer 20,984 COFI from the DAO account to compensate the above users.", "choices": ["\u540c\u610f\uff08YES\uff09", "\u53cd\u5bf9\uff08NO\uff09"], "start": 1624708800, "end": 1624881600, "snapshot": "12709500", "state": "closed", "author": "0xEd36b17651229475a8EEfbB64B706c18aafD4311", "space": {"id": "cofix", "name": "CoFiX"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmdjkDT2Yf6nnMcvJuLgzZBzm9raaJ2d3TMjH5PLHfvpzX", "voter": "0xA38a0080C0568f7B1cEfA0d555dB73308c1acCEA", "created": 1624719971, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cofix"}}, {"id": "QmcMwQ7gH9FSoGqX1GPNwJgEhPGgREfKKKiXftF37Ufdo8", "voter": "0x321Ad1CCD2A1fef8285Cbd36558Ea2b420c51d70", "created": 1624719956, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cofix"}}, {"id": "QmboK1Mo4Esr8AZwBDRCvQEbF8vePWfwoKRAgNm5z4yU6d", "voter": "0xEd36b17651229475a8EEfbB64B706c18aafD4311", "created": 1624719935, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "cofix"}}]}
