The developer of NYAN.finance, namely Black Zero, has stated he is open to collaborate. A recent governance vote on NYAN.finance has passed to follow in the LGE footsteps of my fellow Marine CORE who have led the way. As CORE has initiated this liquidity revolution potentially leading to a utopian rug-free world. Some of my fellow Marine CORE agree with me that it would be good for our gem CORE to actively engage in collaborations with qualitative projects which follow in the footsteps of CORE, an example of this would be NYAN finance. Do not let the cuteness of NYAN fool you, the quality is there and they are actively improving their tokenomics and the developers are developing daily. Why I believe this potential collaboration / partnership would benefit CORE, is due to NYAN having a community-governed autonomous DeFi hedge fund which is likely to invest in CORE as the investment is community governed. Secondly, the benefit for CORE would be essentially letting CORE give the liquidity stamp of approval which I believe to be is invaluable for such revolutionary and novel technology introduced by CORE. \n\nWhy I believe it would benefit NYAN.finance is due to Nyan currently having a liquidity issue for the yield coins such as NIP and DNYAN. The LGE would solving this liquidity issue for NYAN and could solve this issue for NIP and possibly DNYAN as well. This would lead to a further increase in traction for CORE as well as NYAN, also increasing the price floor for NYAN as was achieved with CORE. This increased adoption/growth of NYAN would also create buying pressure on the more scarce coin DNYAN. \n\nI truly believe this would be a mutually beneficial collaboration which I\u2019d love to see happen, hence this proposal.\n\nI call upon my brethren to come together and let your voice be heard!", "choices": ["Yes, we want a CORE x NYAN collaboration and a NYAN/CORE vault.", "No, we don't want CORE to collaborate with NYAN and we don't want a NYAN/CORE vault."], "start": 1601805600, "end": 1601978400, "snapshot": "11001135", "state": "closed", "author": "0x314cE8032e5B9c30d9C2793301465916c9864b96", "space": {"id": "core", "name": "CoreVault"}, "votes": 4, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmYXHEiAYLq2QogaMQ2juxAEXsb2UJv6Zdm7HWtmNZN994", "voter": "0xb3bA0C0A23E95A75F3b8AA26831d89df5008aB53", "created": 1601851838, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "core"}}, {"id": "QmRE3mTKVhPk7dXNniJnXki5gNXPdhJETMnmeN3uV9WcKi", "voter": "0xBf36AD2cF5d218D6B7b3FBB31A3f5b16040fb1b7", "created": 1601848810, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "core"}}, {"id": "Qmakrs7vu54SvFkmgsCKGQXS79SgvLwW3JHD8PoCY78xwK", "voter": "0x314cE8032e5B9c30d9C2793301465916c9864b96", "created": 1601847209, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "core"}}, {"id": "QmQ4NNiyMTC4NM5p936u2Rn5WkxsWe5tvy9p6wthEQK14E", "voter": "0xFeaB41B3172496f8be4f77909222D8c2fD031535", "created": 1601847099, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "core"}}]}
