They are in a sense an advertising program for the project. If a newcomer were to earn enough eth to pay for staking and unstaking transactions, they get a taste of what it means to feast on dumplings. The higher APY will call to them like a siren. \n\nI propose that the ETH/XYZ pools that pay jiaozi be cut back by reducing their multiplier to  0.10x but not retired. A 90% issuance reduction would ensure that whales do not dump on jiaozi token holders. No matter how many eth or usd a whale has, all they can do to jiaozi is fill up the tiny allotment of new jiaozi from the eth/usd pool. They will grow bored, and eventually move on, or move into a preffered jiaozi pool. \n\nHowever, the .10x jiaozi pools would still serve as a very important point of advertisement for new potential jiaozi stakers and farmers. The ability to simply advertise jiaozi and tell someone to just stake and try it out... is incredibly powerful from a marketing perspective. Tokenomics does matter. And preventing whales who have no stake in jiaozi from dumping on the project is important. But getting new jiaozi farmers is important as well.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1600344000, "end": 1609416000, "snapshot": "10386015", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7Fb7e28B8bbbA6A0C28c8Ac6a522C2FEFe44ee96", "space": {"id": "jiaozi", "name": "JIAOZI"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
