This new JERC will have the following utilities added to it, that are financed by funds mined by the JERC bot.\n\nFrozen Baked Jiaozi. So, you want you baked jiaozi to earn some cash? You could throw it in the BJ/Jiaozi pool.... or you can freeze it. Freezing your baked jiaozi gives you 1,500 jiaozi immediately, but locks your baked Jiaozi for 6 months. At the end of 6 months, you can redeem your frozen baked jiaozi. This is a 30% apy on your baked jiaozi.\n\nMoney market operations. 20%-30% of all funds taken in by the JERC 2.0 should be put towards the usdc/usdt pool. Every month, 2.5% of the usdt/usdc pool is withdrawn, and is used to purchase jiaozi. The purchased jiaozi is sent to the burn address. This ensures that jiaozi has a long term value proposition. I choose usdc/usdt or usdc/dai because they are stable cashflow coin pairs. They will not fluctuate like the btc pairs. They are slow, steady, and reliable.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1602248400, "end": 1602410400, "snapshot": "11033319", "state": "closed", "author": "0x62b675Dd73dc534A29a701eFAc45095cA7d422d4", "space": {"id": "jiaozi", "name": "JIAOZI"}, "votes": 3, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmUd1w2QcjU1SPHSCNgFD8hqUHyuHZBgzzJTEd2apKneH2", "voter": "0x8F45C2D94e9fFFde3E1078259bBC5a211BE8f5e7", "created": 1602303317, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jiaozi"}}, {"id": "QmSjNDyvzLFpRTo5n1vgH2dK6BY4ufZ6G3s9EWLYWe6REG", "voter": "0x52FDE589742Ad2C907e05d697CbF3Cf3e8c206e7", "created": 1602297049, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jiaozi"}}, {"id": "QmUQZBsh8aEdE4ZPURYw8xhnXo8dTxGvDGNi1gK5smTQVu", "voter": "0x62b675Dd73dc534A29a701eFAc45095cA7d422d4", "created": 1602249300, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jiaozi"}}]}
