Now, consider that UNI/Jiaozi is a pair that brings new value to Jiaozi. \n\nI propose that ALL the pools that offer Uniswap rewards be added. Also, these pools should have their rewards tweaked dynamically to exactly match the value of the emission of UNI tokens from uniswap. In addition, a third button called harvest and lock should be added to the website. This button claims all jiaozi and then immediately places a transaction to deposit the maximum number possible of both UNI and Jiaozi tokens in the uni/jiaozi pool.\n\nThis ensures that newly minted UNI is immediately staked alongside jiaozi, thus bumping up the liquidity of jiaozi.
