All the purchases of ETH/Jiaozi, and all the sells of ETH/Jiaozi will be summed up to create a new target number. \nThis target number will be multiplied by .85 and .5 respectively, and divided into the daily computation reward pot, and the block target pot. \nThe block target pot and the daily computation reward pot will be each divided by 6500 to get the rewards per block. \nEvery 24 hours, ANY user can click on the computation reward pot, and pay the gas fees to execute the daily computation to sum up the transactions from previous day, and get a new daily block target pot. \nEvery block, the daily computation reward pot gets a small payout of jiaozi. This way, Jiaozi's protocol will finance its own targeting of a dynamic price target. \n\nThe block target pot will be bounded on a lower limit at 50 jiaozi per block, and bounded at an upper limit of 350 Jiaozi per block.
