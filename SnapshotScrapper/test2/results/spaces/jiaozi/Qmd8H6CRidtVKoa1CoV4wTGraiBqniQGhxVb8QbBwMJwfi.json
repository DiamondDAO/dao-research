There are two competing functions in regards to non jiaozi pools. One is negative, the other positive. \n\nThe negative: People can farm large amounts of jiaozi, and dump that jiaozi on the open market. \n\nThe positive: People can be introduced to jiaozi through the non-jiaozi pools. \n\nProposal part 1: Create a study that tracks the total liquidity staked in non-jiaozi pools vs the price of jiaozi. Create a second study that tracks the total liquidity of all jiaozi/xyz against emissions rates against jiaozi price.\n\nProposal part 2: create a clear fee and pricing structure that can enable pools for non jiaozi pairs to remain for marketing purposes, but not be dominated by whales. I reccomend that ALL nonjiaozi pools share the proceeds from a single pot. Whenever someone adds to the eth/usdt pool, the apy on the yfi/eth pool should drop. This pool should be at maximum 10% of all jiaozi emitted. \n\nCreate a second pool specifically for projects that have integrated with jiaozi, and offer benefits to jiaozi. For example, if the waifu project integrates the eating of baked jiaozi, they need to be moved into this new pool. Baked Jiaozi/eth should be in this pool as well. This pool should be at maximum 25% of all jiaozi emitted. \n\nCreate a third pool specifically for vampire mining programs. This pool should have the payouts dynamically allocated to match uni payouts (which are incredibly low apy compared to jiaozi)\n\nCreate a Fourth pool specifically for pools that provide liquidity to jiaozi. This should be the largest share. Eth should be reduced from 6x-> 3x to be in line with other pools here. Liquidity spreading is incredibly important. When Eth dominates the liquidity, other pools do not see pool interaction.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1601035200, "end": 1601467200, "snapshot": "10927238", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7Fb7e28B8bbbA6A0C28c8Ac6a522C2FEFe44ee96", "space": {"id": "jiaozi", "name": "JIAOZI"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmSKKjWRJXq7j97DATg4V8wwY2HhjUucwFMhWt928pg8ck", "voter": "0xA87BAC952868726052dcce756C864F3BB2Bbf4ff", "created": 1601173819, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jiaozi"}}]}
