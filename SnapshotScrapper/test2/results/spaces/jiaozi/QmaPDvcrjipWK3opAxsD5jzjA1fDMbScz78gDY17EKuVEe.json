Baked Jiaozi is created by burning Jiaozi in an oven contract. The oven contract will randomly burn between 90% and 99.9% of all jiaozi placed in the oven. Minimum amount deposited is 1k jiaozi. Minimum payout is 1 baked jiaozi. After the oven contract is finished, Baked Jiaozi should be added in an eth/BakedJ pool and a jiaozi/BakedJ pool as a 6x pool reward. Gambling dapps should be implemented that take baked jiaozi as an input, and pay it as an output.", "choices": ["Yes", "No"], "start": 1600603200, "end": 1600776000, "snapshot": "10875859", "state": "closed", "author": "0x251D7739d82D23F6cA7642432A03A6c2Dde213cC", "space": {"id": "jiaozi", "name": "JIAOZI"}, "votes": 1, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmXoQvfPj3J5u6MepQ1KAZ8cVy67YrZpPifwtJ2QD9jCbQ", "voter": "0xAb8bF2c3393f53A4c2CfaB15dc5DA3C7A0F43ABB", "created": 1600661311, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "jiaozi"}}]}
