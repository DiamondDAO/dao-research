{"id": "QmdcwtjSndwB7xGo9x9eLqnhPNBBE6FqCSNgU8QFBc7fWJ", "title": "RECESS FC", "body": "As discussed in the Discord, I'd like to formally propose our first community initiative: the RECESS FC Sorare club.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Sorare, they call themselves \"The Global Fantasy Football Game\". Basically you buy soccer card NFTs on the marketplace and build virtual squads with them. You can compete in different leagues and are ranked on a leaderboard based on your players' performance. The top ranked teams get prizes (either in the form of ETH or of new cards, which have you can add to your roster or sell on the marketplace).\n\nI propose the following:\n\nMANAGER\nWe will hire community member Gambi as the first RECESS FC manager. Gambi is one of the best soccer minds I know, as evidenced by his recent performances on Sorare (https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/822876308458963005/825416540077031424/unknown.png?width=1410&height=797). I'm happy to provide more evidence to back this up as well.\n\nGambi's performance fee will be 15% of the profits, in ETH + 5% of the profits in the form of $RECESS tokens (at a rate of 1 ETH = 3,600 $RECESS). Performance will be evaluated quarterly, and a manager change can be proposed by community vote should performance be deemed inadequate (sorry Gambi!)\n\nINITIAL OFFERING\nWe will aim to get the team up and running for the MLS season (April 17th). Each community member who wants to participate can choose how much ETH to contribute, and their initial ownership share will be determined by (their ETH contributed during the initial offering) / (total ETH contributed during the initial offering). Each member who contributes ETH will also get $RECESS tokens at a rate of 1 ETH = 3,600 $RECESS. The ETH will be used to buy cards and enter tournaments, with the ultimate goal of growing winning more ETH + cards.\n\nSUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTIONS\nFor anyone who wants to join late (i.e. after the start of the MLS season on April 17th), their ownership share will be determined by (their ETH contributed) / (post-money ETH value of the team, as determined by SorareData). They will also receive bonus RECESS tokens -- however, this will be at half the market rate of $RECESS on Uniswap (\ud83d\udc40).\n\nCARD CONTRIBUTIONS\nTo make the math easier, we will only be accepting ETH contributions.\n\nREDEMPTION\nThere will be a quarterly redemption period for those who want to withdraw their share of the pool in ETH (we may need to sell some cards for liquidity).\n\nTAX IMPLICATIONS\nIdk, you're on your own.\n\nPutting this poll up now, and it's gonna be active for 48 hours.", "choices": ["Yeee let's do it", "I object"], "start": 1617235200, "end": 1617408000, "snapshot": "12145707", "state": "closed", "author": "0x397F6029828F89818AbFAC6ad55aF2E56f648751", "space": {"id": "recess.eth", "name": "recess.community"}, "votes": 12, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmP2afMP6rdkJRjG7HZ2Cc1fsQDT6QnD8BFrzTCuv91k25", "voter": "0x8193a0B58301B2F6CD10B68f97C2a79523668803", "created": 1617288974, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "recess.eth"}}, {"id": "QmaHz7p8SDQucy5f7P9eKWRZ1CSg8ArpKjaAaE4QNkkqBF", "voter": "0x8AC78f5EA737D871bCE7F0bf56cF2dD53cC1c069", "created": 1617269585, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "recess.eth"}}, {"id": "QmTa2ZaevptubxXutSrU9FKJvUgpy4GQqcXkbrAaDx9XMN", "voter": "0xA3b7cf82cC952c3fE8c99f7461f2fba9B8e66293", "created": 1617251926, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "recess.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcTzHyPrTyXq9P7BWTvebb1oY7hp5QWsBtJZNoVJcCHzz", "voter": "0xe7bA4861dAB7fA95aE5fb8227dE310133ca56a29", "created": 1617250830, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "recess.eth"}}, {"id": "QmePAbsXyU2TyBHiyEQu1zKBN1HEpHc8EEJneSLHa9sGqg", "voter": "0x9b5146a53FA189102c17D711FbC222AAe72E0B60", "created": 1617248223, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "recess.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYdWragf8tNSWtnXKJkcnZWYv8ACgEAnvxM19nd3DYb4X", "voter": "0xd8856cCe3F878d3Ea03964F80B18987fF1919272", "created": 1617247849, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "recess.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbPY1e8SDVcG7sbm2YRV12UuVCRyh35Epj5vDfPTfDT8W", "voter": "0x32881B665Aca94c07a5e30D169fcDE92A37cfe7e", "created": 1617245446, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "recess.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYZwddMofpthFRvogmGcQBeWhNTaoA9FDkr22zLZjeQXn", "voter": "0x5090c4Fead5Be112b643BC75d61bF42339675448", "created": 1617243388, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "recess.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNRjd2SFXk29eT1KfEy3V6g6bSPFBXXUpt7qEgEyYdjm2", "voter": "0xD21dA717eE1805325cd4f84cBEDcddf8Fc0a809c", "created": 1617242747, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "recess.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYoY6BQXyB4mRARnwQYRW26rGoRMa46s1zfjPeV4fj9y2", "voter": "0xEDF151713de9d0125F7951c5c0B2c18A0F3BBebf", "created": 1617241804, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "recess.eth"}}, {"id": "QmU9tK1jzrpmYqPQhPWKU5Es2o1vddUJbahMey4Sgd32vQ", "voter": "0x99799dBb5A66B2ED2499524a741AB7911236db1C", "created": 1617241529, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "recess.eth"}}, {"id": "QmZaGY2JcUDRD4VosXF3YAH4nPHsGbm7THYhtfbKyr4rHq", "voter": "0xdc3d1E0c5EE14141Ea3a0eE0B58BB3191C14d0E4", "created": 1617241486, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "recess.eth"}}]}
