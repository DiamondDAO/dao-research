He has spent the last decade as a retail trader and has experience with Forex, futures, options, options on futures, equities and crypto.  He entered the crypto space in 2019 and joined TokenSets as a premiere trader.  He quickly rose to the top of the leaderboards in total buyers, AUM and performance.

Ever since entering the DeFi space in 2019 I have become very passionate about centralized finance.  That journey began with me registering as a social trader on TokenSets in early 2020 and developing some of the largest AUM and highest yielding social sets to date.  This journey has culminated in me becoming a major advocate of DeFi where I often write detailed technical write-ups of various DeFi topics and have even been inspired to start a YouTube channel where I plan on creating a hub of video tutorials to help onboard the next generation of decentralized finance users.\n\nWhile I have felt drawn to many things (teaching, writing articles, videos, etc.) my strongest passions have always been with software development and financial markets.  That fact is clear over my decade plus experience as both a full stack software developer as well as a trader and student of global markets.  This position as the Yam Dao Set Portfolio Manager gives me an opportunity to use those passions and skills to help further the goals of the Yam dao and wider Yam community.  I believe that the future of Yam is very bright and this community has much to look forward to in the years ahead.\n\nThank you for considering me for this position and the responsibilities and duties it entails.\n\n#### What I\u2019ve done for Yam:\n[YAM Investment PortfolioDescription and Current Road
