Even if the number of coins increases by itself\nIt only takes the result of the online function\n\n(\u2605In the future, if the program works perfectly, 100% of YCD coins will be rewarded fairly with your account based on the YAMv2 snapshot, and distribution will be supported by linking several types of DEFI functions.\nHereby\nYAM project program error free and no gas required fixed assets on the go.\nAlso, the compensation issue is resolved at this time.\u2605)\n\n* YAMv2 reward support is not included in fixed assets YAMv3.\nSnapshots recorded in YAMv2 can be rewarded with a completed YCD in the future. \"\n\nConclusion: YAMv3 solves the online function. \n<Based on stable technological innovation, we will give a fair return to those who crossed the unpaved road together. : We crossed the mountain together>", "choices": ["Agree if possible", "I do not know"], "start": 1598824800, "end": 1598882400, "snapshot": "10699228", "state": "closed", "author": "0xe8524f92d729D32844870838714B2A5E5070930F", "space": {"id": "yam.eth", "name": "Yam Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
