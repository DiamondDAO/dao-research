Submit both ETH/DPI to Uniswap Liquidity Pool.\n2. Take Uniswap LP Tokens and stake those on Indexcoop.com which will farm Index tokens at a ~55% APY (unstable).\n\nMotivation\nOur goal is to increase the value of the Yam Treasury.\nThe larger the Yam Treasury they more we can utilize to funds to develop the Yam ecosystem.\nUsing assets already in the treasury (DPI and ETH) to gain additional yield is advantageous but we must evaluate the risks.\n\nRisks and mitigating factors:\n\n1. (Minimal Risk / High Value Loss) Indexcoop farming contract bug or exploit.\na. Indexcoop developers are the same people who created tokenset.com\nb. Farming contract is a fork of Uniswap\n2. (Minimal Risk / High Value Loss) Uniswap Liquidity Pool bug or exploit.\na. Lindy effect \u2013 Uniswap has been battle tested since 2018.\n3. (Minimal Risk / Low Value Loss) Providing Liquidity in a Uniswap Pool is subject to Impermanent Loss (IL).\na. Explained here: https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/\nb. As an LP we do collect trading fees from the pool, which can easily offset Impermanent Loss.\nc. DPI and ETH are highly correlated, which mitigates the risk of IL.\n\nRisks overall are minimal but possible.\n\nSpecifications\n\n1. Informal review of Indexcoop\u2019s contracts.\n2. Provide Liquidity on DPI/ETH pool at Uniswap\n3. Stake Uniswap LP tokens on Indexcoop.\n4. Claim INDEX tokens every 2 weeks (or whatever timeframe devs think is best) and Hold tokens in treasury", "choices": ["Stake it baby!", "Do not pass go, do not collect $$$"], "start": 1603879200, "end": 1604052000, "snapshot": "11144500", "state": "closed", "author": "0xbdac5657eDd13F47C3DD924eAa36Cf1Ec49672cc", "space": {"id": "yam.eth", "name": "Yam Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
