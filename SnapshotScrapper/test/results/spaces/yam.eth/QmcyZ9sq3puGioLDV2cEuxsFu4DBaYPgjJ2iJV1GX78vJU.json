We saw this during the V1 Yam speculative bubble.\n\n3] Providing liquidity on Mooniswap will allow the community to farm 1\" governance tokens and expand the influence of yam governance to other components of the DeFi market.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@1inch.exchange/1inch-revolutionizes-automated-market-maker-amm-segment-with-mooniswap-e068c20d94c\n\nAs an addendum - if this proposal passes, I suggest that we engage with the 1\" team to determine how their vision may or may not be commensurate with the Yam community and whether we can receive special incentives, such as a greater share of the 1\" governance token. It may be the case that 1\" is afraid of failed governance but if Yam proves to be an effective governing body we may be seen as a vested interest/custodian in the success of mooniswap and related services.\n", "choices": ["Yes, V3 should contain Mooniswap Pools", "No, V3 should not contain Mooniswap Pools"], "start": 1598356800, "end": 1599048000, "snapshot": "1", "state": "closed", "author": "0x65f4424CEa0593c53Fe4E34d55455238BD058a6c", "space": {"id": "yam.eth", "name": "Yam Finance"}, "votes": 0, "votes_data": []}
