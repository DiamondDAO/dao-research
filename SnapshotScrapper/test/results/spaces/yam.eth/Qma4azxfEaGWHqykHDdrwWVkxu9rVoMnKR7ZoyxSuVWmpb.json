Received my securities license. Expert knowledge in risk management, mutual funds, insurance, mortgages and sales. \n\nAfter wealth management, I built and ran restaurants. Two restaurants were built from ground up, including design, construction, hiring, marketing, guest relations, accounting and all internet systems. One is a quick service restaurant 4-stars on yelp and opening a second location in 2021. I am the primary shareholder and my partner runs the operations. The other one is a full-service restaurant 4.7 stars on opentable.com. Expert knowledge in operations management from top down. Managed a team of 60 employees. \n\nMy alternative life has been in crypto since 2015. Crypto is my passion. I believe in the future of it, I eat sleep dream crypto. Created multiple crypto related products and services, from a hedge fund to physical secure crypto gift cards. Been searching for an opportunity to join a project/team like Yam. This is where my passion lies.\n\n## Value add to Yam Team\nExperience in finance, business and crypto puts me in a unique position to be operations role to create an organized framework and to fully utilize resources to achieve Yam\u2019s mission. My goal is to create enough infrastructure so that Yam as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization can become an Autonomous that can achieve its mission. \n\n## What I\u2019ve done for Yam\nI started with Yam since V1, assisted in the voting to save yam but didn\u2019t start contributing until V3. With my wealth management background I saw the proposal to buy $250k DPI without any thoughts to overall treasury management. To me as a token holder at that time, I was worried that without an overall portfolio plan with risk management, the treasury would be in trouble for the long term, so I volunteered. Following the guidance of the Yam team and the Yamifesto, here is a list of things that I\u2019ve directly worked on and wrote about on the forum.\n1. Formalize Yam Treasury % Allocation for Yam Ecosystem Development (including developer pay) / Investment Strategy\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/formalize-yam-treasury-allocation-for-yam-ecosystem-development-including-developer-pay-vs-investment-strategy/742\n\tb. This started the discussion of portfolio management and a better way to manage the treasury. \n2. Formalize a treasury investing strategy and allocation.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/formalize-a-treasury-investing-strategy-and-allocation/703\n\tb. Led to this discussion of investment strategy for the investment side of the treasury. \n3. YIP Proposal: Treasury investment strategy and allocation \u2013 Updated.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-proposal-treasury-investment-strategy-and-allocation-updated/831\n\tb. Listen respond and improve idea but continually push forward. \n\tc. I think this is when I was invited to be a \u201cstrategist\u201d, before this point I was only a community member trying to help out. \n4. YIP Proposal: Treasury investment strategy and allocation - Updated 10/16.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-proposal-treasury-investment-strategy-and-allocation-updated-10-16/853\n\tb. Listening and learning what limitations and how to go about working inside the Yam ecosystem. It is easy for you or I to buy a cryptocurrency and stake/farm but doing it using a DAO with on-chain governance voting is significantly different. \n5. YIP Proposal: Treasury Investment Strategy - DPI / ETH Indexcoop Farming.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-proposal-treasury-investment-strategy-dpi-eth-indexcoop-farming/873/2\n\tb. Applying discussions from community and investment strategy from above proposals, I push forward the idea of farming Index.\n6. YAM Investment Portfolio - Description and Current Road Map.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-investment-portfolio-description-and-current-road-map/906\n\tb. A conversation on between me and another member on discord sparked the idea of a collaboration between Tokensets and Yam which eventually turned into YDS \u2013 Yam Dao Set. \n\tc. Fortunately one of our strategists is @Krugman which is #2 in Assets Under Management on Tokensets currently. Krugman was able to formalize this relationship. \n\td. I continued to update the community on current progress via discord chats and forum posts. \n7. YAM Investment Portfolio Update #1 \u2013 Voting for Investment Strategy.\na. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-investment-portfolio-strategy-polling-voting/927\n\tb. Krugman is an expert at technical analysis for risk management. He designed a system to manage the risk of the portfolio in YDS \u2013 Yam Dao Set. \n\tc. Proposal helps the community decide on the level or risk / return that we want for the investment arm. \n8. YIP: Create a Contributor Manager Position.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-create-a-contributor-manager-position/947\n\tb. As I was going through the process of YDS I noticed a few things that needed more structure in Yam. \n\t\ti. We had super talented contributors that have stuck around and volunteer their time because they believed in Yam. When they could they help tremendously but ultimately their time was tied up in things that they needed to do to create income. \n\t\tii. There was no structure to coordinate the efforts of contributors. Without coordination of efforts, a lot of value is wasted. \n\t\tiii. I proposed that Trent take up the efforts and be a manager of current and future contributors. \n\t\tiv. In addition, someone needs to manage a budget for paying contributors. Volunteers can only last so long without pay.\n9. YAM Investment Portfolio Update #2.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-investment-portfolio-update-2/948/1\n\tb. Update to YDS as we communicate with the set team and find out how to collaborate so it is mutually beneficial. \n\tc. I nominate Krugman to manage the set because of his past experiences. I believe he will make us money. \n\td. We also start plans to offer this as a product to other organizations. We are building a unique product that will be very beneficial for other DAOs. Once we get YDS setup, it will be very easy to market this product/service and generate revenues for Yam treasury. \n10. Modelling of Size and Effectiveness of The Great Yam Wall.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-size-and-effectiveness-of-the-great-yam-wall/959\n\tb. Ragequit was one of the reasons why I invested into Yam but because of a few issues it was side tracked. \n\tc. TotV3 and I designed the new ragequit protocol that will use the treasury to directly support the price of Yams if it goes down too much. \n\td. This post models the potential value that can be achieved out of a small portion of the treasury. \n\te. If we are to use treasury funds we should be aware of the potential impact of those funds. \n\nTL/DR:\nI\u2019ve directly worked on a number of proposals to build the Yam ecosystem. Every proposal was unprompted, I noticed a need and started the proposals then adjusted as I learned, discussed and understood. My efforts directly with purchasing ETH and Farming Index (DPI was not my initiative) have already generated $10ks+ in revenue. YDS I know will generate even more revenue for Yam. Ragequit was a community initiative but never finished, and I intend to finish it. \n\nAside from proposals, everything that I do I create a framework and discuss with the team. I\u2019ve opened the lines of communication to the Chinese community. These frameworks are a critical component in creating an autonomous organization. \u201cGive a person a fish and it will feed him for one day, teach a person how to fish and it will feed him forever,\u201d this is my motto in building Yam. In order for Yam to be autonomous there needs to be clear guidance for every step of the organization. Creating a framework in the beginning of the organization before it grows to big is key to growth and sustainability. I\u2019ve learned this lesson multiple times owning and running my own organizations.  \n\n## What I am planning to do for Yam\nOrganizing, creating, monitoring operations to ensure directed focus on accomplishing milestones that advance our Yamifesto. Building the framework and laying the foundation to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). I will build long term sustainable growth of Yam and ecosystem so that anyone can operate.", "choices": ["Accept", "Decline"], "start": 1607551200, "end": 1607724000, "snapshot": "11421202", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9Ebc8AD4011C7f559743Eb25705CCF5A9B58D0bc", "space": {"id": "yam.eth", "name": "Yam Finance"}, "votes": 25, "votes_data": [{"id": "QmU7avbeM4mU93B4UacS85u7ktkV3FomUgrjoZrKS8TDn6", "voter": "0xf75fcD9849d3365d436D0CD889Ed500150C9482A", "created": 1607717739, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYZCD4rcf6zBtcDQexsSXB4qS1Fa1Pev86KEaFKdGTyJB", "voter": "0x46499275b5c4d67dfa46B92D89aADA3158ea392e", "created": 1607716404, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQvPD2btFj3KDD4VccTJJQu4drxmg5ss6U7BjoSinX4Au", "voter": "0x61db2684758E3b14572Ec5d106194eDe3Dad8238", "created": 1607705578, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcsiZLu1QYRfMXjeZKdNbQAd3ym5EQgyvhMus5iU1KGuQ", "voter": "0x18A842c315C6A8c54d041c65b0aA2732f50c00dA", "created": 1607704076, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmUhmDXh3TktDEC8aNPbaNPdme4qoCKZuLL9pZHZrjDkFG", "voter": "0x9102F9C7Df2f0Aa4aa57ddaa47102D8A24E62E36", "created": 1607698938, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQzerMPH8k5EGBVbJbZB7fCpAZmKF3qs7MXLvWuJ9jsfK", "voter": "0xE60090d1Fb225a48a3Ffa2AF04D78fF411Ed00b1", "created": 1607670250, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmes3ptRnHtsbLrdfdZ4pGcxNwN4NZfHSKSwXdw4iJeXoi", "voter": "0xFE12054F51E8410C312A1Fb966900f0CF4D7878E", "created": 1607651896, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmX63e5DSzno6qH3iDCgZph51Sx3fsLSPXUCnFbMdGjHdz", "voter": "0x8d07D225a769b7Af3A923481E1FdF49180e6A265", "created": 1607645105, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmemKjNYnedwBUx4DLf2SRvUE5gAgFfFALZJWAxtE7xLhj", "voter": "0xE843724E7BeFC9b0313de359949cd498892f0d19", "created": 1607632939, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmc8Srje9JhZYRXudc59nFuzAksWc4tM6qb2qzwbb6U5ko", "voter": "0x653d63E4F2D7112a19f5Eb993890a3F27b48aDa5", "created": 1607611555, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmVuBcJQoyiRJoxpN7ZnZf3mc7KmkcQdnoJ42JgVqTR1je", "voter": "0x21d79c2Be4ab3de2802a60Da66f86D497D06102B", "created": 1607607223, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQP5VnbRShzqKgQQ3kfLzd7g1pGT4XgvxxBDcVG7vBheg", "voter": "0x3fc333cAA03Eb3423b1ece56fD187fc71807CbF8", "created": 1607588384, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmQmPr4wMfWFuh2cMH2gx6Sc5ELMp7xYKTcR5EdwvXLYWx", "voter": "0x4544e2Fae244eA4Ca20d075bb760561Ce5990DC3", "created": 1607584304, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmR4kt4LQ4ZJCgzbu49JDeJGrEvqR3CGq92R7Yp8r4Avqb", "voter": "0xd7aC4581eF4E2BB6cC3734Da183B981bfd0Ee2A2", "created": 1607581376, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmeJq7RNFHTW7tkE9Yb3CsYrR8jALEXDYYfx6icRELYtE3", "voter": "0x3009BF947473f6Fa670B74C7742288b920F18a4a", "created": 1607580565, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmfGkAKgFhqgSpbXUPSbtexBffsbGjXGpy7zUYQ56begez", "voter": "0x3E0e20c5ea683DD94410A74DD0EAF300a76384af", "created": 1607573716, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmRZ4Nx8q5gcPLyd6wc9rGS5kRoSXDuQKDfxpgDHMsDAWB", "voter": "0x67100Ca6A03C4027E0b232F721C26a26222Ad1a9", "created": 1607570820, "choice": 2, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcfEYfUMoiLd2yY6neo9RPnsjnvYkHrX1kqGXTYBjEqpX", "voter": "0x8d5F05270da470e015b67Ab5042BDbE2D2FEFB48", "created": 1607570255, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmcY42gZCYMTBZUdWYyfFwTXjHvJexohk9pxcrA3eH1Y8R", "voter": "0x1F717Ce8ff07597ee7c408b5623dF40AaAf1787C", "created": 1607570132, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "Qmeo7sneYsU6LJYaJekPbf2XeXLAN4iCejsxpJLZwgKMEE", "voter": "0xCCa95E7b4d55a8B9B4B24342024661cf56E831B4", "created": 1607569816, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmXDcWVfEz89ikDSyzMXmftQcqTSECwP8wd1EFC5U9roek", "voter": "0xEC3281124d4c2FCA8A88e3076C1E7749CfEcb7F2", "created": 1607569750, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNsQ3rigezzN47UruzXhEfnWrNgUAb9HKuLcPnHjzDG47", "voter": "0x07a1f6fc89223c5ebD4e4ddaE89Ac97629856A0f", "created": 1607568684, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmYtw6nKMYTRok1QZbPNiZ2a2SfYKoFRskw5TTVuCgLYTb", "voter": "0xdF0259238271427C469ABC18A2CB3047d5c12466", "created": 1607564583, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmbXZEqgE9q43jBANqg79K2YSAoHiHvh7XKinBtJXnCBvc", "voter": "0xdADc6F71986643d9e9CB368f08Eb6F1333F6d8f9", "created": 1607560127, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}, {"id": "QmNdyHTkVWrkanUYH2EAbdfjQMibYY3awFCMwzotSK3trN", "voter": "0x8028A4F06A209B942b692b2714466f795DD18003", "created": 1607556934, "choice": 1, "space": {"id": "yam.eth"}}]}
